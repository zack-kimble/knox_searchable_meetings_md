| 0:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| Let's go to our deferred applications that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| And before we do, I want to thank Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you for giving us these maps and even color coding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| That really helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| We can tell with that as to how close they are to school zones and other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| So that is very, very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| Thank you very much, Grant, in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| I voted for your position, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| First applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| Thomas Joseph Pitner, MTMs, 7712 Clinton Highway for own premises, formerly Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=175)|
| 0:03:05| They've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Could you please state your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Thomas Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| Address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Heck, I can't even remember it part of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| 7712 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=208)|
| 0:03:50| Mr. Pitner, last month you were here before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| and the matter was deferred pending some documentation that you had submitted to the law director's office for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| Those documents are still being reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| We're still looking into the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| And at this point we would need additional time to review those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| and we would ask for a continuance of another 30 days to review those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| They did get copies of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| I did go up to the office there, law director's office, county law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| and the lady in there did make copies of that for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| I believe I gave a copy to U.K. also, and he's also picked one up on his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| He didn't give me a copy, and I went to Oxentown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Well, I may have your copy here because if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| then the law director's office didn't get a copy also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| But I do have copies here where I am subleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| If you'd like me to leave them with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| You could do that if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I believe that those documents, you did submit them to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| He does have those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| He does, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| He just needs additional time to review the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| and therefore they're asking for additional time of another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| Another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| I know the last time they said it seemed like the documents weren't the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| I think basically, I don't know if I'm wrong or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| but it's like there might be a trust issue that they considered what the business was once before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| and what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| I understand you need time to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Hopefully the next 30 days I can get a beer license where it will get my revenue going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| where I can do improvements on this place because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| I would like to have a nicer establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| but I don't want to take out-of-pocket money until this gets approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| so I can make a nicer place for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| So I'll give another 30 days and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you, Mr. Pintner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Do I hear a motion to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Motion from Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Mr. Pintner, I'm still trying to find out where you are on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| Can you describe some of the areas around your location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Just north of Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| Where it intersects with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Yeah, there's a Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Just past that, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| He's up on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Yeah, up on the hill past Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| What's the store across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| I think it's an Exxon gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| and there's also another little tavern there that's called Corn Pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| It's on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| It faces Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Off Street from there used to be a roller skating rink right there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| I believe so, down below it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| We had a properly first and second deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| The only thing I would like to ask for the law department, if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| before John gets gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| John, evidently, he has some stuff that he wants to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| He knows some stuff that he's working with this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| We'd like to put this to bed if we can next month, if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| Our applications show here that we have been working with this ever since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| And this guy keeps coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| We need to wrap this up one way or another for the gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=440)|

| 0:08:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| We're going to go through some of the questioning that we had last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| I think that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:26| I'm going to go ahead and ask you some questions with regard to your application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=506)|

| 0:15:43| So the pole will protect their gas meter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=958)|

| 0:16:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=986)|

| 0:18:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Do you own the premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1117)|

| 0:18:41| Jim Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1121)|

| 0:19:00| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1140)|

| 0:19:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| And now we're going to need reports from the following departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| The health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1159)|

| 0:19:25| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Health department, what's pending with your report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| The inspector who has this area has not gone out to the facility yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| so he needs to go to make the inspection of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| It's my understanding that the other business needs to complete a business closeout if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| and you also need a certified copy of your registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Surrender your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| The previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| That's him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| He's that guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Yes, I just want to ask a question of UK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Mr. Monett, how close is this business to AL Lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| Probably 200, 300 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| So is that within?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Well, AL Lots, Commissioner, was built after this filling station's been in business for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:43| The only place you can use a 300, 500 foot setback is where a business has been closed for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:54| Then you have to meet all codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| So this business then has been in continual operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Well, that's still a concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Any other discussion from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Law department, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Any other questions from the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| I'll make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| There's been a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| I'll make a motion pending report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Second, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1295)|

| 0:22:24| or transportation of intoxicating liquor or any crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1344)|

| 0:22:40| And this is an application for on premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Do you own the premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1364)|

| 0:22:49| Roy Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1374)|

| 0:23:03| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1383)|

| 0:23:15| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| Did I understand that you said that you were the only owner of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:35| I think that the commission has a copy of the report where a report was given on a stolen barbecue grill out at Brickyard at the Brickyard BBQ, and a Jeffrey James Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1415)|

| 0:23:53| He made the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1433)|

| 0:23:59| No, I never said the actual owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1439)|

| 0:24:36| Do you have other copies of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Some commissioners don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| It should be right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| A round tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1483)|

| 0:25:00| You got one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| Well, I mean, I gave them all of my information because I asked when I did the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| Sheriff's department, review this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1516)|

| 0:25:41| There was a theft of a barbecue grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Officer Yarnell, Investigator Yarnell, worked the case, and Mr. Jeffrey James Barnes stated to the officer that he was the owner of the establishment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1546)|
| 0:26:13| I was the owner of the grill, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| It was my grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| It wasn't the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Maybe that's where the theft occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| So you'll need to come to the microphone and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| My name is Jeffrey Barrons, 7545 Brickyard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| I told the officer it was my grill, not that I own the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| I could bring Officer Yarnell in at the next year-board meeting if you'd like to talk to the investigator that worked the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| Where's he at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| He's on the evening shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Chairman, should we defer this and bring in the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| I want to say, you know, I was a policeman for 18 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| and it's awful easy to get things confused when you're taking a report like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| I've been down and spoken with Mr. Barnes, and I asked him this same question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| and he told me that his mom, who's before you today, was the owner of that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| I don't think he's intentionally trying to misrepresent anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| He told me about this theft, and he told me about the vandalism to some other pieces of equipment that he has on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| And I also want to go on record, too, while we're here today as saying I was instrumental in denying the Barrons family their permit last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:46| and in doing so I made a freshman mistake on this board by not doing my homework in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| I've been down and visited with Mr. Barnes, and I have found him to be very forthright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| He has cleaned up this piece of property tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| He has been a calming influence of the little neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| He has become intimately involved with the Powell High School athletic program and the newspaper staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| And, in fact, he's even embraced the Powell community so much he is moving there very soon into a condominium a short distance away from his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:25| And I want this board to know that I'm going to retract my position from last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| and I'm going to recommend, if we can get this other matter clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| I'm going to recommend that Mr. Barnes be granted this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| He has been to the BZA, and they passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| And I just want this board to know that I hope whoever follows me in this seat doesn't make the same mistake I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| without qualifying everything before I sat up here and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| So that's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I'm in favor of Mr. Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Mr. Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| You know, this report here is just a piece of information, I guess, that we can use to earn a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and certainly taking sides with either party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| But don't we have a paper trail, a legal trail of permits, business licenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Does that make a hell of a difference to what's on this report today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| It does make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Have they not proved they are the legal owners of the business through licenses and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| Anything else, Mr. Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| I want to ask one question myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Commissioner Rancher, you can maybe help me with this, because you've lived out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Didn't this at one time that they used to serve here years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| And I did not know that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| But on my side inspection with Jeff Barnes, who's before you today, he walked me through his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| And there's quite a large area in there, probably 1,500 to 2,000 square feet, that he's not using at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| but has the potential to generate significant revenue for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| And it's dependent on our vote today, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| And he has, while I was there, and this was one of my concerns last month, while I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:32| two members of a local church came down and made arrangements with Mr. Barnes to cook their Thanksgiving turkeys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:43| So the community has really embraced this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| And it's in a building that there was nothing there for two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| I don't know for sure how long it was unoccupied, but it was previously called, I think, the Curbside Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| And things have just had a tough time going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| But I think that he's got what the Powell community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| And that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| And I applaud it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| My question is, they are just two lots away from a high school, not like an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| like what you were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| But they're just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| You've got the phone company next to that is a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Then you've got the high school right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| How did that get through BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| I wasn't there, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| UK, you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| The law has been changed, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Back then, it was 100 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Our laws now say 500 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| And the state law says that we can't go less than 300 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| So if we're wrong, we're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Well, they're over 300 feet probably from where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| How far are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Well, they've got a variance for 147 feet, but I don't know where they're measured from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| It's measured from the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Front door, front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Mr. Barron, I was just wondering, what is your relationship with the corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| My mom owns the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Are you part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| You work with her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I just cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| She's the only one in the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| She's the only one on the business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| He's the only one applying for the beer license with no manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| And I believe what the sheriff's department is telling us, that there's been a police report made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| It could very well be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| She asked you if she could bring the officer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Of course, Commissioner Ann Tree talked about how long he was an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| I'll join him with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| I've been one a long time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| She could have stated on her application that her son was in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| We've either got her not telling the truth on who was in it or a false police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| That's what it amounts to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Or a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| I think the officer took my word of it being my grill as being my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| He very well could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Because I told him it was my grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| So, I mean, he could have taken that the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| I told him my mom owned the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:39| Have you taken the server training class yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I'm going to defer to my colleague in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| He's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| You've talked with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| I'm going to go with your judgment because, again, you've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| And if these folks are not good operators, we're going to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| I mean, they're going to come in and we're going to know that they're not operating properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| But from what we understand, they are operating properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| and they're trying to be good citizens and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| It seems to me that this is perhaps a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| You've stated under oath that you are not a part of this and all your paperwork says otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| So, if you've lied to us under oath, then that's a whole different ball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| But from what I gather, maybe I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| but I just kind of get the idea that you folks just want to run a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and you just want to do your thing and just be good citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| So, Mr. Roundtree, if you want to make a motion, I'll be happy to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| We have two more departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| As you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| UK, do you have any additional information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| I don't believe so, Mr. Fire Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| And the fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Do we have a first and second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| I want to just mention this to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Are you all new to the area, relatively new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| That school has had the worst problem of any school with alcohol-related tragic accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| And I'm going to be like my commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I'm going to support you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| but I just want you to know that that community has had double-figure-digit numbers of teens that have died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| and alcohol-related things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2124)|

| 0:37:57| strive to see the best in everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2277)|

| 0:38:01| is best for all here and in the world around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2281)|

| 0:38:41| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Commissioner Morris, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| There's no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2336)|
| 0:39:09| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Withdrawals, postponements, deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Mr. Chairman, I've distributed a sheet here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| fairly large print, one page of five amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| all dealing with vehicle fleet usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| I'd like them to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| As one resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| As five separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Five separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| You have numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| I'd like to add everything that's to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Withdraw everything that's in the book to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Defer everything that's to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| And I'd like to withdraw resolution R-08-6918| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:17| Was it 9 what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| 918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| 918 on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| The law director wants to add resolution R-08-6113,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:40| dealing with the personnel board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| It's a stormwater maintenance agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:12| Also, 925 needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| Point of order, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| I'm looking at these resolutions to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| And it looks like here we have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Amendment R-08-6903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| These are all items that were discussed in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| If something doesn't go through the way you want to one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| can you bring it back less than a month later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| and put it back on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Or is there a time limit as to how much some time needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| to pass before an item can be brought back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| It's not that I'm necessarily against some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Some of them I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Some of them I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| But my concern is that if we start coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| the next month every time something doesn't go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| that we would like to, then this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| is going to get awful full if everybody starts doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:13| What are you talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| This amendment on Knox County's vehicle policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| This came up during the budget meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| And also here's an orange sheet of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| that has to do with tourism and sports money and hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| All of these items were heard during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| And I'm wondering, can we bring something back this quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Because what I'm afraid will happen is if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| and if we do bring these back up for a vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| that what's going to happen is any time a vote doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| go the way one of us would like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| then we're going to immediately put the same thing right back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| on the next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| And these long agendas are going to get even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Mr. Chairman, quickly in response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| the item on the orange sheet was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| withdrawn in the process of the budget meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| So it was not voted on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| The items of the vehicle fleet agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| was handled very differently and has been since rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| And there was significant support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| for bringing it back as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Commissioners actually asked that it did come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| So I don't think we're setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| And I'd hate to think because of what amounts to quibbling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| we are going to exclude these from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| And I actually asked him to bring that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| And I know others do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| And what my question is is that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| start a precedent of bringing stuff back month after month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| I mean, there's some of these things on the vehicle agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| I support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| There's one of them that I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| But for the most part, I support a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| It's that if we set the precedent that if you don't win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| one meeting, you can immediately bring it back at the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| then what's going to happen is these meetings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| are already dreadfully long are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| to be even more dreadfully long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:17| Commissioner Lambert, 903 we did not vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| That was not voted on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| The law director, could you weigh in on the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| This is a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Well, by your own rules, your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| provide that you can't bring up a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| that you voted on for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| And that's by the commission's own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Of course, you can suspend your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| with a 2 thirds vote, which is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| what it requires to add a matter to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| 2 thirds vote, 13 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Have you seen the sheet, the white sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Again, I would point out these are not exactly the same items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| They have been rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| And so I don't believe that that informal rule of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| or formal rule of the commission applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| And we've already adopted it by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| And I hope we continue to follow that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| Commissioner Harmon, why don't you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| put these just on the agenda for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| If that's the will of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| But I'd prefer that they be on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| These were your amendments, Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| that you proposed the other day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| This is a new variation on same, because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| has been rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Mr. Chairman, I think if we just take a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| it has to be 2 thirds to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| I'm going to make it in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| So I guess the motion would be, come from Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| to place these on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I thought we already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| But if a motion is needed, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| move that all five of these items be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:17| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Go ahead, Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Yes, Mr. Chairman, we'd like to add item 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| Are there any other additions or deletions or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Not, can I get a motion for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| We have one more, 917, to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| It's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| OK, it's in here to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| 911, I just want to make sure that does get withdrawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I think Commissioner Moore took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| What's 917?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| 917?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| What number are you giving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| No, it's 917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| It just needs a new account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| Would they not do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:21| I'll read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| Because it's already on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Is there any other things that need to come before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Mr. Chairman, I just said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| I don't know if you heard it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| 911 was asked to be withdrawn by the sponsor instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| of those that were voted on at committees to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| So you'll get that as withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| 911, it was asked to be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| by the sponsor versus the commission committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2870)|
| 0:48:05| John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| OK, I believe there's an item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| or was on the agenda related to NRR, a lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| agreement with NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| That may have been removed for today's discussion purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| I just want to bring you up to date on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| And we've been working in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| with the mayor's office on a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| to natural resources recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| We've gone through a mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| We're going to be bringing a mediation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| to this body next month for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| as well as included with that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| be what this body desires as far as continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| with that relationship or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| What the mayor's office and I are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| unless there's a great amount of heartburn from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| today, is to extend the agreement, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| expires at the end of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| for one month, which would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| at least a necessary amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| to get everything together to get it back before you in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| So unless there's a move today to do something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| in good faith, we're going to extend our arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| that we have with NRR for one month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| to take us through July with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| that we're going to bring the entire matter back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| for resolution next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Commissioner Lutheau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Well, that was the question I was getting ready to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| was because I knew that their contract ran out this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| And what were we going to do for another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| I think, I believe there needs to be a vote of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| to extend it even one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Is that not correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| If this body wishes to do that today, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| If you don't, I would consider them holding over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| basically, under the same terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| as we have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Under what authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Under the laws of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Are you saying that you have the authority to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| the contract, or the mayor has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| The mayor has the right to extend it for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| And it's so written in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| there's actually a three-year extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| under the contract, which I would prefer not to exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| I would prefer it to come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| So what we've been trying to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| is an agreement to extend it for one month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| to allow you ample opportunity to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| Well, I do have some problems with extending it for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| but I'll leave that for further discussion, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| other commissioners wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I did not bring all of the binders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| but they're collecting on my bookshelf at home on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| And I have never seen so much material generated in dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| And then I see this on our desk before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Do you not have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Where'd it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:31| But I don't think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| But I don't think I'd buy this stuff, after all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| I don't think that we need to renew that for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| What's our options if we don't renew it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| There are a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| One, the mayor could renew the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| under the existing terms, and it would extend for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Two, I mean, we've gone through a bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:04| An intent to award has been made to NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| So we've gone through those procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| and that's kind of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| I think when in doubt, we can do without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Well, if something doesn't occur by the end of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| then we'll have no one operating the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| What would happen with what's already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| Sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| With the mulch that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| NRR may claim ownership to it, as the previous contractor did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| and took all of the supplies away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| I expect they'll do that anyway for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| We have, I guess for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| we've been working trying to, a lot of depositions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:07| There's been a lawsuit filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| We've had a pretty good bit of discovery that's taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| In addition to that, we've had a mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| It's occurred on a couple of different days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| with a number of counsel and clients, one of your own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| Scott Moore, attended the last mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| pursuant to your authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| And a mediation agreement has been signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| As part of that, we want to certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| have ample opportunity to bring it before committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| to bring it before this body in an orderly way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| So that's why we're looking at a one-month extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| under the current contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| What resolution are we speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| It's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| What's before this body today is a lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| which right now it doesn't appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| that that'll be one of the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| A lease agreement under those terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| is what's in your book with NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| Through the mediation, a different agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| has been reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| But we want to make sure that we have enough time and enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| time for you all to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| And we want to go through the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| We want to go through your committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| And we'll speak to the agreement next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| And we'll have all the attorneys here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| And so that's why I bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| We want to make sure that you're in the loop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| that nothing is being worked around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| And that's why the mayor's office is in total agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| So that's why we're bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Just for clarification, haven't we already voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| to defer this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Wasn't that Mr. Moore's motion that we defer everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| and withdraw everything and add everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Did we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| So if we have, we've already voted to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| We've not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:19| We just haven't objected to deferring it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| We're still making amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| I had just a couple of things I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| like to have a discussion on as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Completely unrelated, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Chancellor Fantzler had a hearing this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| I'd like to hear our law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Not now, but during the course of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Secondly, the chancellor's ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| with regards to sector plans and what this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| or this commission can and cannot do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| I think during zonings I'd like to hear that discussion as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we go ahead and extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| their contract for a month in our hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| so that we can allow the law director the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| that he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Don, this probably would really save the county some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| wouldn't it, in any case and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| Commissioner, I hope to ferret all that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| within the next month and bring before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| so you have an opportunity to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| A lot has been said regarding NRR, our relationship with NRR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| over the past 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| And we're finally at the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| we can bring you something that most of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| feel pretty comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| But we want to bring it to you through our orderly process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| And so do I feel comfortable with the mediation agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| But I want to bring it to you, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| and have all the players here to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| the different parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Pardon me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| I know that you can't tell us anything about the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| because you're still trying to agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| But I don't guess a month would hurt us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and it may save the county some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| And we still have the right to vote it down in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| So I'm going to second Ms. Davis's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| We do have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Are there any questions of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| I'd like to make a, well, first I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| want to make sure that we need to make this friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| If we extend this as it's written now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| does that allow biosolids for another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| They're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:31| I mean, that was the main thing I wanted to make sure is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| and my friendly amendment was going to be that we amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| the contract not to allow biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| if biosolids are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| But if they're already exempt, then that wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| They've already stopped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Was there anything else to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| If not, the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Can I get a motion for consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Mr. Chairman, make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Properly moved and seconded on consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Don't believe we have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Nothing on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:21| That makes it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Approval of the minutes of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| Wait a minute, we're out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| No, we're on consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Yeah, consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Backing up, consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=3519)|

| 1:07:43| So my question is going to be the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| Are we going to vote if, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| there's one block of four or another block of four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Do we have to decide which block of four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Are we going to vote one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| like if we were voting on seat A, seat B, and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Or are we going to allow each commissioner to just list off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| four people, and those that get 10 votes or more are on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| and then we just keep making the rounds going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| I'm just sort of throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| How are we going to go about trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| four different seats here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Right now, the names are all in one block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| I understand that, but I'm pretty sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| because there were some last month, some other names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| and I was handed some more names when I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| So we're going to have more nominees, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| in trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| Because I may want to vote for part on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| and part on the other, or a different combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| So I think we need to decide how that process is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Normally, don't we vote one on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| and the one with the least votes drops off on all appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| We can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| That's the way we normally do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| when we just have one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| A lot of times where we've had two or three at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| if you remember the personnel and the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| all we had were the number that were open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| We didn't have anybody else nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| So you could vote on it as a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Well, let me hear from a couple more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I'm open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I just want to, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| If we ever get this motion approved first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Well, we don't even have a motion on the floor yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| I need to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Yes, I have just a question about this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| My understanding was that some of these people's expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| was in finance, and some of it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| more engineering and technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| And I don't think we would want to load the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| if that's indeed the case, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| want to load the board with all finance people or all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| technical people if they need that proper mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| So I think we'd have to take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| in the process also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| But I still think that comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| to each individual commissioner trying to decipher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| who they want to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I mean, that's for us to decide if someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| strong in finance, or strong in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| or strong in engineering, or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| We need a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| But I still think it all comes down to allowing each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| commissioner to be able to vote who they want to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Oh, you'd like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| I was just going to say, I like Craig's idea of voting on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Just for the sake of getting this out as a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Mr. Edwards has already spoken at length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| about qualifications, skill sets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| and whatever with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| And so I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| I'll probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Yes, Captain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| that Alvin Nance, Carl Tindall, Louise Fogarty, and Clem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Renfro be voted on as well as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| Do we have a second to a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| We have a substitute motion on the floor to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| could you call the names out one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Alvin Nance, Carl Tindall, Louise Fogarty, and Clem Renfro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| Is everyone clear on the motion, substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4291)|

| 1:11:51| Commissioner Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4311)|

| 1:11:58| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4321)|

| 1:12:20| 10-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Motion passes, 10-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| So those four members are part of the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| And I didn't give Suzanne Shriver a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| I guess it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:54| Resolution 111 is approving the reappointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| of Harold Stewart, Stanley LaDuke, and Carolyn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| Cheater as judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| 9-0 to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| I think, was it intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| We voted no recommendation, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| asked for there to be a call for a subcommittee of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| I think it's judicial court subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| to hear this before commission were to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| I think the judges are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| I think we made that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| to see how the process went for the people that applied for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Also, their duties of being a judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| And I think usually we had a subcommittee met first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| And judges, if you're, is that fine with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| or is that something we need to approve today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:13| I'm Jeff Emery, one of the general session's judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| You all in the past have enacted some sort of subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| I don't know if it's one of your standing committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| or not, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| They would ask to review the applicants for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| Quite frankly, and it's a sad report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| there's not a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| And the reason is the hours are lousy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| and the pay's not what they can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| We have difficulty even finding substitute commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| So you're saying the hours are lousy and the pay's worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| And we have trouble just finding people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| to fill in when these people are sick or take vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| The three that are on here have served us for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| Harold Stewart's been on board for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| as has Stanley LeDuc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| And all three of them, Carol and Jeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| And these are the only names that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| Usually we would get notice if you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| if your committee or subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| wanted to be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| And we did not hear at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Judge Emory, was this advertised as far as the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| Indicta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I believe it was Indicta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| It should have been Indicta, which is the Bar Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| But we don't get a lot of response from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| I just wanted to make sure that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| were to vote on these today that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| If you've got any letters from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| I have not received any, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| wanted to make sure we did go through an open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| of asking, in case there was people, attorneys out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| interested in doing this, that we did go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| through the process of allowing people to apply and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| trying to figure out who would be the best, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Well, you know, perfect for a start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| is for somebody to try it for a while to see if they like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:22| We canvass people to try to find people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| to sit in for these, the ones that you've appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| And it's very difficult to find people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I can believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| You appoint, they're appointed, the law provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| It's funny, because each, the authority to appoint them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| is different for each county, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| on population classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| You appoint them from up to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| And you've staggered the terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| It's our suggestion that you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| so you assure us the continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| So three of them are up this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| How many do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| We have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| I thank you, Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| I've had some calls from the Sheriff's Office and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| And I don't know if any of these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| are the ones they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Certainly people who have a serious criminal record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| seem to be getting low bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| And I think one of them that was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| in a shooting with a KPD officer was in jail on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| I think they had four charges, and three of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| were reduced to almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| And that's how that individual made a bond over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| and ended up in a shooting on Monday, I think, the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| So I think we just need to see, since there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| so many new commissioners, to see what their duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I'll let you tell us what their duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| They set bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| They initiate warrants at the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| of law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| They work a 24-hour shift, I mean, 24-hour days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I mean, they're staffed 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| They set bonds and recognizances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| usually at the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| They look at past history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| They look at the request of the law enforcement agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| But they are independent judicial officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| We can't dictate to them what bond to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| That's not allowed under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| They have to exercise their own independent discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| on how to set that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| Does your office oversee them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| We have just very, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| We oversee them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| We work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| We have general, very general, oversight authority over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| Not day-to-day, the hands-on, that we're down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| looking over their shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| We're not supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| That's not what that's designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Can you tell us what the salary is for judicial commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| I'm afraid you'd ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| I'm thinking it's high 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| I think it's around 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| 59, there's an administrative, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| one that's designated as an administrative judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| commissioner, and that is Harold Stewart, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| has general administrative duties over the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| And he gets about $1,000, $1,500 more than the rest of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Maybe $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| Mr. Chairman, do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Has someone seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| We didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| OK, I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| that we defer it 30 days and have a meeting, the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| subcommittee, with the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Who's chairman of that committee now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I think it's Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| And I don't know who else is on there, but to get these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| out, because I guess at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| they're commission appointments with your blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Yeah, I think we all-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| So I think just to make sure some of these people haven't-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| They've been with us a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Now, their term expires June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| That's why it's on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| But if they-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Holdover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| I think they would be treated as a holdover, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| Would you not agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| If you want to go through that interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| but that initiative-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| We may not need a process, but we may need just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| to go through a meeting to see, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| think there's some people wanting to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| And I don't know if any of these individuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| You mean to speak as to the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| duties, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Maybe just the judgment of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| I mean, I guess because no one has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| over these individuals once they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| appointed by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| And I guess-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| We don't have authority to tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| set this bond at this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| We can do that on our own if somebody brings it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| But I think that's what comes of making sure we get good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| and not saying these people are not good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| but getting people who, if someone comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| and has 25 charges in the past, and 15 DUIs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:59| and he gets another DUI, and this is his 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| and he's got robbery, and assault, and attempted murder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| that we don't have people that have a judgment that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| $500, set a bond, $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| I would hope nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| That scenario you just related, I would hope nobody's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| But I think there could be some scenarios that somebody wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| to bring to the forefront, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| know if it needs to be done in a public setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| but certainly at a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| And maybe it's not accurate, and maybe that's a good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=4882)|

| 1:24:02| Mr. Chair, what we did a month ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| was approve three names for these three seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| However, whenever you look at their appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| they're staggered appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| We need for this body to designate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Deborah York, Logan Brummett, and Irma Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5063)|

| 1:28:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| What is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Discussions on it, and I just remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| being in favor of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Doug, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Bail us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| It was reviewed every year, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Yeah, maybe that was it, to review it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| Well, I think it was going to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Reviewed by the parks director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| And that's written in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| And it's written in the contract now, the law director says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| Hey, Doug, is this to occupy an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| to watch over the sheriff's stuff out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| No, there's no sheriff's stuff left out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| It's really to watch over the wildlife refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| We have a motion on the floor, and property second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5354)|

| 1:30:26| Voted 9-0 to approve, but I've got some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I'd like to ask since I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| I want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Property moved and seconded by Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| You've got two options here, but it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| like we only have one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| And what I'm basing it on is option number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| if we traded him all 18 acres for the 28 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| our property's appraised at $810,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| and his is $755,000, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| So we're talking about roughly $155,000 right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| that we're giving him, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| No, it's about $65,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| OK, I meant $65,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| But anyway, on the other one down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| we've got $55,000, and for him and ours, it's $618,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| So that's quite a big difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| He's giving us $50,000 there, but we're still $13,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| I would rather go with option number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| because we're only giving him $13,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| and we're still retaining four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| I think that's a no-brainer if we don't go with number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Let me explain, too, because I apologize for just getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| to you today, because we just met this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| and I just got the final appraisal back on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| And the appraisal on the developer's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| did come in a little lower than what we thought it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| We were projecting $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| It came in at $555,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| So we met with the developer this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| and actually came up with these two options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| not just to back us in the corner with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| The one thing I did do, and let me report, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| we did have the public meeting Thursday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| and it was very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| We had 21 people that filled out the forms for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| and 19 were in favor of it, and two were neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| And several of those were neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| that were right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| As a matter of fact, one of the folks that lives next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| is here tonight, and they were very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| supportive of the park development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| as opposed to the commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| But as we met this morning, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| realized we were a little further apart than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| we thought we would be, talked with Mr. Curry, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| to see if he would be able to do any more on moving us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| and he was not willing to go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| And that's what we came up with option two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| to get us a little closer on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| In talking with AYSO, I got a hold of a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| of their board members, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| do you all prefer one or the other here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Because they're the ones that really got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| to live through the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| They're very much in favor of getting the larger acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| They, at this time, are in favor of option one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| because they would like to just go ahead and get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| The option two, we would need to put the four acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| track on the market, sell it, and then my intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| would be to use that sale money to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| in to develop the fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Obviously, we put that on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| We have no idea how long it would be on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| We really have no idea if we would really get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| our appraised value, especially considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| the real estate market right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| So they were in favor of option one for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| But you're entirely right, when you look at option two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| the numbers are much more to our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| But we do assume more risk there than option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Well, in a way, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:30| But do you realize what that property's been bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| up there in the industrial park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| It's been bringing pretty good prices there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| I think it would be worth more than the $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:41| I think that's a tough question right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| with the real estate market the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| It's a real unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| But here again, do we have the money, regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| to go ahead with this park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| What we can do, if we take option number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| that's enough money to get them moved over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| And we can get them set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| And then, like I said, we put the other on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| to try to develop the funds to build more permanent fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| We're OK with it either way, as far as the Parks Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| Again, I just know AYSO, their wish is they'd prefer number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:14| But again, we're OK either direction with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| If I was in there, I would prefer number one, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| if I were them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Yes, which four acres would you take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| I mean, because I heard from some of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| out there that that land is quite boggy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| So is there a chance that some of that, like a four acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| parcel, might be worth less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Now, the four acres, if you look at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| there at the bottom that says county property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| the larger piece is where the soccer fields are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| And then connected to that is that separate darkened piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| there that does front John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| That is the four acre track we're talking about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| Is it boggy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| It's low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Is it boggy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| I'm not real sure, but it is low lying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Probably to make it a more marketable piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| you'd want to elevate it, I'd imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| somewhere between two and four feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| to get it more at the road grade as a marketable piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| Commissioner, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I talked to some of the residents out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| and they're very much in favor of this land swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| and the exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:22| But I find it very interesting that the Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| Department ends up in the middle of a lot of these land swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| How is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| I mean, it is a Parks Department issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| So I think probably the fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| understand both sides of the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| both what it's going to take to build these fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| as well as having a relationship with like the AYSO soccer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| groups, that they're really managing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| I want to ask that the commissioners vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| for option one on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| And there are several reasons, unless you're there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| and live in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| One of it is a little bit of a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| in that this is on an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| Everybody is very familiar with the truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| that comes down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| It also sits up in a corner where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| you go to a convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| So you have a lot of traffic that goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| but it's not eight to five for the truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| traffic that supplies the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| to the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Also, there's a creek that sits in the back of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| and I've seen that field itself flooded many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| But one of the big reasons is that the businesses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| is currently sits next to this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| there's only about 15, 20 parking spaces for this field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| to serve over 400 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Should there be an act of vandalism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Should a business move in that doesn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| that's not friendly for the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| and put up a gator anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| We have nowhere to put parking for these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| And to gain four acres, I don't have to explain to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| everybody is looking for acreage from Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| to the 9th District for additional space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| Carter Park right now, we're full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| We're going to have to take a tennis court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| and our little old skate park, lump you up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| and turn it into a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| And you just cannot replace this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| And if you were to look at it, it's not much farther from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| to where the pros fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| That piece of land that it currently owns, old brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| and it looks like a commercial piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| This land that they're going to move it to looks pristine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| I mean, it's ideal for a greenway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| We can talk dollars and cents, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| some intangibles with safety, the land, the parking issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| As far as if it's a little boggier or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| that really shouldn't play into your minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| $50,000 you can look at as a community grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| whatever that you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| But it's my strong recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| that we go with option number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| and four additional acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| You're making that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| I think that's part of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| I think the original motion to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| I'll just take out a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| and just accept within the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| to accept option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:28| I'll just accept option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| And whoever seconded, I don't remember who seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| Do you accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| Doug, can you tell me what the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| in the number of athletic fields is from option one to two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| Now, the two options still get us moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Are you talking about the difference in number of fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| from our original piece of property to the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| It'll roughly double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Because really, the 14 acres we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| we're probably using about 12 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| So in reality, for the Parks Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| we're going from 12 usable acres up to 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| Now, to be honest, too, there's 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| There's a couple acres there that are in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| But even if you take the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| we're probably going from 12 acres up to around 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| is what we're trading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| Finish, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Yes, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| In all reality here, on number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| they're not giving us $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| We're only getting $135,000 when you take the $65,000 less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| that their property is priced for than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| But when you go down to option two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| this is the best deal for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| And the reason why, going by your appraisal up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| that four acres is $191,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| If you take that with the $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| he's given us and everything, we're getting $859,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| for the 14 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| So that's quite a bit more money than even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| what it's appraised at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| So I would have to say, this is a no-brainer for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| I mean, we're not set up here to just give everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| a piece of property that they wanted when we can get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| money for ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| And I'm using your appraisal figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| This unused parcel that's appraised, four acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| is appraised at $191,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| That's $810,000 both piece of property is appraised at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| If he gives us $618,000, I mean, this 14 acres down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| is worth $618,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| He's given us $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| And plus, we're getting to keep that $491,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| We're in all reality generating $859,000 on option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Not quite following all your math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Now, the 14 acres is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:03| We'd only be trading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| For $618,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| We're getting to keep $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Right, if in fact we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Roughly there, so that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Right, if we can sell for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| If we keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Plus, we're getting $50,000 more for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| So we're actually keeping $240-some-thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| Better off by keeping this four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| On your appraisal and what we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| In my mind, the real difference is about $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| between the two deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Between the two deals, it has to be more than that when you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| got this four acres appraised at $191,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| What would it cost to make that four acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| You said it would need to be raised two to three feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| to make it sellable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| So what would it cost to bring in enough dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| to raise four acres two to three feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| That's a good engineering question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| and I couldn't even give you a good estimate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| But the appraised value is $191,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| So that, I would think, would just be as is, not improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Yeah, depends on who did the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| Well, apparently we used the same people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| on all these appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Is that correct, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| I've visited both of these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| I attended the public meeting the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| I've had calls about the first piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| because all of these pieces of property are for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| The warehousing company is looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| at being on Straw Plains Pike, and we have soccer fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| in the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| So just right off the bat, I see no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| with getting those two groups of people moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| The soccer fields need to be on the less-traveled Straw Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| The trucking companies need to be in the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Both of these roads have intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| with traffic control, so the safety is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| an issue of vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| I think the safety that's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| and as Commissioner Ballard has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| the parking concerns we might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| if one of these adjacent pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| was to sell in the industrial park would be out of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| So we're only now down to the four-acre part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| The four-acre part has been for sale all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| and has not sold at whatever the appraised price is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| So I think it's a no-brainer for us to get underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| and get the kids moved to the new place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| because we're talking about soccer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| and it's going to be quick upon us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| if they're going to be able to play soccer at the new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| So it needs to be settled now, and I'm in favor of option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| How long has that four-acre parcel been for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| Well, I think any of the inventory in the industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| is always available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| So if somebody's looking for a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| four acres in front of John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| But I mean, how long has it actively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| someone actively been trying to sell that piece of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Yeah, that I'm not real sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| Who knows the answer to this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Well, it's probably been ever since the park's been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| But when you look at that, we set prices on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| in these industrial parks to how many jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| that people bring in, the salaries that they're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| So even if we reduce the price to 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| from the $191,000 that it's appraised at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| it still may be more beneficial to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| reducing the price to someone that's bringing jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| and things in here and salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| So that's where you arrive at the prices on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| And of course, there's not a whole lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| come in with wanting four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Most of them want four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| But then when you get right around to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| we're giving up 14 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| I can go along with number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| but that's a bad deal for the county on number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| Financially and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| especially right now, we need money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| And somebody could possibly come along next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| and want this four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| That's speculation, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| Commissioner Wright, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| Yes, I was going to say I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| Commissioner Pinkston's remark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| that I had left out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| There is jobs involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| So I would really like to see them in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| That is going to make up somewhat in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| if there's a disparity of the two prices, that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| The other is, as Commissioner Ballard has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| we need to go for a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| that gets all of our things done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| So maybe we come up a couple of thousand dollars short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Doug, do you know what the sales price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| on that four acres is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Obviously, if we've got it listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| or there's some group that's trying to market it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| we need, somebody knows how much that's for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| what the price, sale price is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| irregardless of what it appraises for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| Well, and again, it's not really actively listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| in terms of a sign being on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, obviously, if somebody was looking for a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| and it's vacant, I think we'd have an approach there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| But because it is attached to the park property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| again, it's not something we have a great big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| for sale sign on it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| but it is frontage on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| And frankly, in the 15 years that I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| I've never had an inquiry about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| nor am I aware of any through the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| Like I say, for an industrial area, it is probably not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| it certainly has value because it does front John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| but it is a small piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| and there's not a lot of retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| going into that particular stretch of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| and it obviously would be more that kind of size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| Victoria, you said something about boggy was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| what had you heard about that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| It was not the four acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| it was the 14 acres where the kids were playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| Cause I had made the comment that the new parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| the one that this developer has bought from Waco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| that area floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| But then I heard from several families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| they said that currently they're in the industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| that the grounds that the kids play soccer on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| are extremely boggy there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| Are you saying the part that we're taking in on trade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| also floods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Mr. Bufo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Doug, I guess if we do option one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| one, and that four acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| who's going to be the new owner of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| The developer will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| And any idea what his plans are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| As far as I know right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| he may want to come up to speak to this if I'm off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| cause he is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| but he talked about really just probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| trying to do some improvements to it and selling it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| So if he improves it and then sells it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| hopefully that brings some new jobs to the area and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| And he might be a more motivated seller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| than evidently we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| if we've not been able to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| and it's been available since we've opened this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| Is it the development corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Is that who handles the sales of these parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| for us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| This one, since it is a county park property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| would probably go through purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| It would go through purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| We have a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| with option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| Passes 16 to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| Option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| Resolution 801| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| is authorizing one or more loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| under one or more loan agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| We've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| Yeah, all those items that we dealt on the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| I will ask they be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| since we've already taken action on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Move to withdraw 801 through 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| We've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| I think we're on 807.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| 807 is approving a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| in the amount of $183,750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| with Lumensoft, is that the way you pronounce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| Corporation for budget slash position control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| planning software and implementation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| Voted 8-1 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| 9-0 to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:49| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| I noted a committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| that I didn't really get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| If there wasn't an American bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| this is a Pakistani company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| I think all of us have had a disturbing experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| of having a call regarding a software matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| being referred somewhere in South Asia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| And I'm just wondering if anyone can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| the bidder, the ownership, the whole question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Ma'am, address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| Jeff Clark with the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| In regard to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:26| this is not a Pakistani company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| It is a U.S. company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| It has...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Its website list says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| The ownership of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| I'm not calling into question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| that's not what I was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| The company itself was started in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| It's an American company, has American employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| The ownership, as you know, all company software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| especially, I think, get bought, sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| belong to umbrella companies, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| This is not a situation where you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| a company that's operating out of Southeast India| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| and you're gonna talk to them long distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| and have trouble understanding the operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| It's not that sort of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| This is a company, it's U.S. based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| U.S. began, and its employees are all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| They're actually located in Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| But it's foreign registered for what, wedding taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| or why is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| I would assume that's probably presumptuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| I'm not exactly sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Probably, and I can't speak to this directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| a buyout, a parent company, an umbrella organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| The ownership isn't taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| during the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| That wasn't one of the things we measured on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| So I can't speak to why they happen to belong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| to somebody who happens to not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| a U.S. membership or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Yeah, you know, it's hard for me to call you Jeff, Colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| Jeff was my colonel in the Civil Air Patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| when I was a kid, and I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| Is this software that you're already using?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| No, it is not software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| This is a new piece of software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| that will tie into the software that we are already using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| enhance our capabilities and finish out the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| that we had begun some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| Okay, and you've assessed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| and in your opinion, this is what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| Yeah, we formed a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| went through the sealed bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| and in addition to going through that RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| we spoke to several companies that were using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| and obviously, one of our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| in evaluating software like that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| what kind of service are we going to get after the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| What about training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| What about implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| And all of those questions were answered to our satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| from all the companies that were using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| I'm going to make the motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I think Mr. Clark probably knows more about this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| than all the rest of us put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| I think we need to trust our experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| and last time I checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| I thought Pakistan was an ally of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| We already have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I know that change was weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:47| Resolution 901 is approving an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| to the Jackson Depot redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6830)|

| 1:54:00| Voted 5-4 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| I note no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6846)|

| 1:54:09| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Commissioner Hyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| John Troyer, do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| John Troyer, do you agree with the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| that we've been presented with regards to the taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| They present them to us in three phases now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| during construction or during the phase and then afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Have you reviewed those figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| and are you in agreement with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| These numbers were presented to myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| and to representatives of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| and the city has taken these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| to an independent banking officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| to also evaluate those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| and we were all in concurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| Mr. Troyer, has the city already voted for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| I'm not sure on the city's schedule on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| Well, this is inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| I don't think we should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| I think we're putting the wrong foot forward first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| I think the city should approve it first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| before they even come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| I understand the city has approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| John, can I ask John a question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| John, what's gonna be the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| that the county can go out on TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| I know we've talked about it probably for the last 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| and what's gonna be the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| that you think we can financially do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| I think we're gonna have to look at every single one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Well, I know, I understand what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| but there's gonna be some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| that you all jump up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| oh, well, we just can't afford anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| And it'd be nice if we know going forward what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| because we're losing a lot of retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| toward the 8th District over there at the Knoxville Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| and I hear that there's some more leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| So what a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| wouldn't have been blighted a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| certainly could be blighted in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| Right, and I think this one makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| and I think this one makes financial sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| and we need to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| And I think we should look at every single one on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| Okay, tell me how it makes financial sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| I think we're taking a blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| and we're gonna make a productive, useful property out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| And you think the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| it's the only way to make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| is the taxpayers get involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| I think this is a good deal for Knox County taxpayers, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| Can you assign dollars to it, Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| Or a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| Is it a two-year deal or a 15-year deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| What's your answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| The proposal is 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| And the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Start now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| That's what it is now, that's what it goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Three and a half times current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| and that's what it goes to after it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Yeah, okay, I've just been handed the numbers again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| The current taxes right now are at $1,471.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| During the term of this TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| that would be taxes on this would be $5,404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| And then after the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| the taxes on this would be $32,000 a year, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| And it's a 15-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| Mr. Petrie, when you came before us for intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| you said that you were supposed to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| before city council that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| and they were going to tell you how much they were gonna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| didn't you apply for a TIF with the city as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Yes, it's all one TIF application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| Okay, and did they approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| Yes, unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| Need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| Joe Petrie, 6818 Crystal View Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| You know, if a TIF is done right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| it doesn't wind up costing the taxpayers a penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| because the amount that is used to pay off the TIF loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| is money that wouldn't exist if the project didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| I mean, I think TIFs are a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| My problem with this one, and it's not with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| you've got a neighbor right next door, Mr. Mark Seroff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| that has been trying for years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| to get some kind of assistance to fix his buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| And over the years, there have been roadblock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| after roadblock thrown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| You know, he got at odds with former Mayor Victor Ashe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| and it just seemed like that no matter what he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| that he couldn't get any assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| and still is struggling with trying to get assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| And he tells me that he's had developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| not you, Mr. Petrie, he speaks very highly of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| but he tells me that developers have threatened him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| that they've come up and they've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| basically, you're gonna sell us this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| for the price we want to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| and if you don't, we have the friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| in the city of Knoxville and with KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| and we're gonna have them take your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| through eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| And the problem is, is we've got a system here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| that it seems like you're one of the first folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| new folks, to come into the redevelopment industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| It's almost, it almost looks like a little mafia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| that if you're not in a certain in-crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| that you're not able to do these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| and that in fact, if you are in that in-crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| that you can throw your weight around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| and threaten property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| that if they don't sell to you at the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| that you want to buy it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| that you're gonna use the power of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| to use eminent domain to take that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| and that's, this one is just so close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| It's right next door, and if I look at the merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| of your project, it absolutely deserves a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| My problem is, is that it being right next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| to a property owner that has tried for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| to get assistance, and actually got to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| where one of his properties burned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| for lack of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| Now, a lot of folks like to blame him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| and a lot of folks like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| that Mr. Seroff shouldn't have owned that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| Well, we live in a free country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| and any man has a right to own a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| and people say, well, they should have taken it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| from him years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| Well, I say just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| I say if we're gonna hand out TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| and if we're gonna hand out beautification grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| and if we're gonna do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| to help revitalize our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| that those tools should be available to all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| not just folks that are in the in crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| and that's what my problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| with the downtown TIFs that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| is it seems like some folks are able to get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| and Mr. Petrie, I'm certainly glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| that you're the first fresh face I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| in that area in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| and some folks aren't, and I just think it looks wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| when we have a system that is preferential to some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| to the point that those folks run around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| and threaten their neighbors to take their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| and that's my problem with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| and I'd like some assurance from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| that if eminent domain is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| to take the neighboring property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| that you will refuse to bid on the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| I can't take the power from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| I can't take their power to use eminent domain away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| That's power granted to them by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| but if we have enough downtown redevelopers stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| I don't believe in using the power of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| to steal people's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| or to force the sale of people's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| I think that we would see that sort of thing stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| and that's why I'm gonna ask you again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| will you make a commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| or will you make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| that you don't believe in eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| and that you will not bid on the neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| if it's taken with eminent domain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| Because what I don't wanna do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| I don't wanna vote for this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| and I don't wanna sit back here a year from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| after Mr. Seroff's property has been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| and you ask for a TIF on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| Well, two things, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| I think I was clear the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| with you about my rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| but a couple of points I might put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| Although I look new to the redevelopment game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| my track record, I believe, would speak for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| For six and a half years, I ran Riverview Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| which was the BB&T Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| which I believe when it sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| was probably the largest one-time county tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| on the rolls that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| It went from a $23 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| in four and a half years to a $41 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| So I think I've got a pretty good track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| of improving the tax valuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| on property in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Secondly, I'd like for all the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| to consider this, my project, on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| Like you said, I'm new to the redevelopment game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| I've been in the real estate business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| in downtown Knoxville for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| I've served on the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| I've served on a couple of Mayor's Task Forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| Yeah, I mean, it's, well, I mean, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| sir, that's what I'm getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| is you've been the member of the right clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| and you've got the right friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| You have a neighbor that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| because he hasn't been a member of the right clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| he hasn't been on the right boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| because a former city mayor decided he didn't like him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| that he has had roadblocks thrown up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| every time he's attempted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| every time he's attempted to get some assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| I can't speak to the innuendo about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| but I can speak to what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| when these properties that are blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| the financial impact without a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| You've seen a property set for 14 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| and eventually burned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| because it had no public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| All we're asking for is the right to borrow from the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| with guarantees that I'm personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| putting my whole life savings onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| to get to do a project that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| will enhance that whole block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| and I might add, improve Mr. Seroff's property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| I believe that our project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| being the first project on that block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| will enhance his property values too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Being a real estate expert, I think I'm right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| So I want you to consider it on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| I think it's odd, and I told you this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| I think it's odd that you would ask me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| to encroach on my personal rights someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| that I don't even foresee an event happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| that I might have to do to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| my own property's valuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| simply because it might someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| be taken through eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| Whoever can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| The taxes that are being brought in right now are how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| They are $1,471.97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Projected after, I guess it's a 15-year TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Which happens to be the max, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| No, I think the max we can go out on a TIF is 15 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| I believe Sentinel Tower was 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| I thought the law was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| to where the max we could go is 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| I don't believe so, but I know Sentinel Tower was 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| but I'm asking for what I think is a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| Now, the $460,123,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| is that the total for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| and the county's part of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Or is that the county's share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| No, it's the total loan value of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| So we'll be borrowing that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| and the increase in the taxes will pay back that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| I understand how a TIF works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| My question is, how much of that $460,000 is county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| and how much of that is city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| The application process doesn't divide that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| Well, I still want the answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| I don't think there is an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Well, we've had other TIF requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| that brought that information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| I think I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| What you'll find out is that the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| is going to be more than half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| No, it's $26,400 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| $26,644 a year on the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| and $22,985 on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| The city taxes are actually higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| than the county taxes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| It doesn't matter, because the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| you can't move debt service to the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| They have about 75 cents, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Commissioner Ivan Harman may know what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| But the city tax rate has a higher amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| dedicated to their debt, which can't go towards a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| than what the county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| All other aspects of the property taxes go to the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:30| That's the reason why I moved the three cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| the other day to the debt portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| So the county actually has a higher rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| that's not part of debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| than what the city does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| because they have a larger portion of their tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| although their tax rate's higher totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| But once you subtract out debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| part of their tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| they actually have a lower amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| that can go towards a TIF than what the county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| So I really need that broken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| Well, I think I can help you with the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| of tax increase that both the city and the county get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| That number is pertinent during the TIF term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| if that's what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| It's $10,492.93 for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| and $5,404.27 for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| That's what you're getting in property taxes during the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| So we'll be getting $5,000 instead of $1,400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| Yes, you're getting three and a half times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| what you're currently getting during the TIF term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| And you projected how much after the TIF was over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| how much would we be receiving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| It would go to, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| if our projections on sales hold true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| which you would hope there would be appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| after the fact, the minimum it should go to is $32,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| Well, would that be both city and county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| No, that's just the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| That's just the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| Yeah, it's a $40,000 project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| Well, see, that's my problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| is that I would think after about 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| if they're somewhere, we're collecting $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| or whatever towards taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| more than what we're collecting, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| let's say we get to keep $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| and there's, say, an additional $20,000 to $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| that's going towards paying off the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| why do you need 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| Why could you not go maybe 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| I think the case is, Mr. Leuthold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| that most of these TIFs are paid off early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| simply because in the term of 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| hopefully we get higher sales prices than we would even project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| That's a market issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| So we hope that the market would bear more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| Secondly, as people resell their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| that money comes back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| It goes on in even higher tax valuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| which means more taxes do come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| and the TIF is paid off earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| sometimes 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| It depends on how much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| You know, when the Sentinel Tower came before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| I got to see their amortization schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| on how it was going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| And I don't have this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| So is there any way you could get that to us by next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:19| I'm sure I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| I'm not sure how that, what that does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| Yeah, you're welcome to anything I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| But, you know, we're trying to start a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| and, you know, we've been approved everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| So we're hopeful that the county would approve this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| Well, I wasn't done, but if you'd like to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| that's fine, and there's other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| We've got a motion to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| I'll take it, Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| We've got a call for the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7860)|

| 2:11:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7913)|

| 2:11:59| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7919)|

| 2:12:03| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| That was 11 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| Put your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Did we talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| Well, Commissioner Smith wanted to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| At least that gives us a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| I'm going to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| But right now, because it was voted right now, I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| Seven yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Eleven no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| Go ahead, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| If you could get that information to me, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| And I'm going to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| Commissioner Smith, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| How long has this building been vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| Can you give us a little history of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| I don't know how long it's been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| It's for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| We're the, I believe, the fourth property owner that's owned it in about the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| We've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars so far, not only on the property but on drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:14| We're prepared to start in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| But we cannot do this project without a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| It just simply can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| I'm going to vote in favor of moving ahead with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| so I guess I'll be voting against the substitute motion because when you look at that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| and you look at the fact that this has been there for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| and here we have someone who's willing to come in and turn it into a viable piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| and the city has already done their part, I think that as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| I'm ready to vote to let it go now or to begin now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| I've actually got a loan calculator Don just handed me that's the amortization schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| Yeah, I mean, I'll take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| Yeah, Joe, that's what I want to look at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| I want to look at the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| You know, commissioners, if maybe we could move this to the end of our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| and give me a chance to read over this, I might be ready to vote today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| or we can go ahead and vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| You're fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| That's the very thing I was going to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| If a few commissioners want to look at the amortization schedule, let's give them the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| Let's move this to the end of the agenda by unanimous consent if we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| Is that okay with everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| We'll move it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Go to work, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| approving the purchase of the lease of the building known as the Family Investment Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8083)|

| 2:14:51| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Finance, 9-0 to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Then property moved in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| Yes, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Who was going to maintain this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| Was PBA going to be, once we retain this building, who's going to take care of it for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:12| or manage the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| We've already arranged for PBA to be the property manager from July 1 moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| Do we know the space cost and communication and IT and all of the 8 to 10 percent overhead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:28| Do we know how much this is going to cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| We know the cost, and that's budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| What we're working on right now is viable tenants who will help us pay for that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8135)|
