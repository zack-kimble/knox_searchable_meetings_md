| 2:43:16| And then in terms of the deadline liability, I'm not sure how much we need to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| I don't think these shelters are going to fall down and hurt somebody on May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9801)|
| 2:43:29| Between then and now, we could look how many lawsuits or accidents were caused by these shelters in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9809)|
| 2:43:36| to see how big of an issue that is in terms of a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| But those are just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Yes, I just want to be known that I did vote along with Mr. Smith at the CAT meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| So there were at least two or three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| But since that time, I've had time to think about it a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| And as I stated previously, first of all, I'm very concerned about anybody and everybody that rides the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9837)|
| 2:44:03| I ride the bus myself sometimes, especially the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| And as you said, it's not about we all would like to have nice facilities for people to wait while they're catching the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9847)|
| 2:44:16| But I think it would be better to have some new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9856)|
| 2:44:23| And we have some funds available to purchase them rather than to tear those down and try to move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9863)|
| 2:44:30| And it has been stated you have students at the University of Tennessee who are people, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9870)|
| 2:44:37| And we need to be concerned about everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| So I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| I don't know what a postponement is really going to accomplish, because we tend to postpone everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9882)|
| 2:44:49| And we need to go ahead and start voting and make decisions, because it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9889)|
| 2:44:54| I don't know why we wanted to postpone this, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| And as the representative from council, I'm going to support what's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9898)|
| 2:45:05| That's my position at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| Mayor, do I get a minute to rebut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| A minute to rebut, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| I would welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| I would, if I can recognize that I vote to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| Go right ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| Thank you, because as one of your representatives on the KTA board, you see the frustrations that I'm going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9918)|
| 2:45:23| On the 22nd of last month, we get this one-page, seven- or eight-line resolution to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9923)|
| 2:45:33| Councilwoman Palmer is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| I made the motion to postpone for 30 days because I would at least like to lay eyes on the shelters that we're going to give away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9936)|
| 2:45:43| Councilman Brown is correct, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| He seconded my motion to postpone, but he did not vote with me on the main motion, which failed seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9945)|
| 2:45:52| I was the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| So I want to explain that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| For the very reasons that you've heard tonight, which have not been specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| they've been very unclear about why we're giving away these shelters, I wanted more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9959)|
| 2:46:06| Mr. Hare chimed in and said, no, no, we can't do that, for the reason that he gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| Now, as stated, Mr. Hare is the director of transportation at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| His interests are there to run that new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| I don't have any divided loyalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| My loyalties are to the city of Knoxville and our passengers, and this does not help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9979)|
| 2:46:25| Why should we not give these shelters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| They chose to do business with somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| Now, let somebody else buy the shelters and give us the ones that we belong to or that belong to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9990)|
| 2:46:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9999)|
| 2:46:40| Well, I think Councilman Brown makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10000)|
| 2:46:43| Let me just clarify why I think it's important to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| Everything that I've heard, I mean, the most compelling arguments is that we're giving away public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| which this meeting has been full of this evening, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| I wanted to see if you can't go back, I mean, if you can go back and strike up some type of an agreement to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10026)|
| 2:47:14| to not give this away and whatever the price might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| If it's $1,500, if that's what it costs to uproot them, I don't think it's good business to uproot them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10037)|
| 2:47:24| They've been there a long time, and I think if you do that, you run the chance of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| of them becoming defective in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| I'm not a mechanical engineer, but just common sense kind of tells me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10053)|
| 2:47:37| So everything that I've heard tonight is talking about the money, and we're giving it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10057)|
| 2:47:41| So perhaps in two weeks' time, I think Councilman Starr makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| I probably should have stood by the 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| I don't think they're going to fall over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| But that's the motion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| And that's the only reason that I thought that it was probably a good idea to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10071)|
| 2:47:59| So the motion on the table is to postpone this resolution for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10085)|
| 2:48:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10087)|
| 2:48:08| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| Is that two noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| Brown and Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| Any other noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| The motion to postpone passes 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| 11M, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Merritt Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10106)|
| 2:48:31| for the Jacob Building Electrical Renovations and Facade Improvements Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| for an amount not to exceed $1,174,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| Motion passes, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| 11N, a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| to negotiate and accept from Hatcher Hill & Associates payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10136)|
| 2:49:02| with respect to property located at 620 and 626 South Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10142)|
| 2:49:07| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 753.305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10153)|
| 2:49:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| Yes, we have Mr. Wetzel here, and I know he's dying to tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| but I understand from reading this that with the pilot this might be economically feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10167)|
| 2:49:35| and make their lender sing happy tunes to the point of lending them money to do the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10175)|
| 2:49:40| and without it, because of the asbestos removal and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10180)|
| 2:49:43| the project's probably not going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| Is that fair or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10185)|
| 2:49:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10186)|
| 2:49:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10187)|
| 2:49:48| They asked for a 15-year pilot, but you gave them a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| We're recommending a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| You'll see a lot of 10-year recommendations on downtown pilots from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| And the bottom line is we'll put a building back into service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| and eventually it will hit the tax rolls at a higher rate after the 10 years passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| For the record, this is the green KUB, the old KUB building, the green building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| Sitting there for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10211)|
| 2:50:12| It's been empty for 10 or 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| Thirteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10213)|
| 2:50:14| Thirteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| Yeah, Mr. Wetzel, just for the record, would you tell us what they pay now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10216)|
| 2:50:19| and what they will be paying after the investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10219)|
| 2:50:26| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10227)|
| 2:50:28| Currently, let me start over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| The current tax bill the city is and county together is $11,202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| and that will be their pilot payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| It is projected after the project's completion that the value of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10238)|
| 2:50:43| would lead to $52,000 a year in taxes, which is what will come in 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| So we'll put those on the list for 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| That's city and county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10250)|
| 2:50:51| City and county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| Not to talk too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| You know, we have our first project issue with the IDB yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| The Starkey Building is our first downtown residential pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| It wraps up at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| If you go into next year, we've got three more coming off the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| So we're starting to cycle into that phase, and it's working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10268)|
| 2:51:12| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10273)|
| 2:51:14| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10275)|
| 2:51:16| I just wanted to add briefly that I don't know if this is considered a blighted property or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| but I have gotten complaints from neighbors that this property is blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| There's missing windows and rubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| So I think it's great that there's a plan to get this back into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10286)|
| 2:51:31| Yeah, I think we'd all agree this is a blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10291)|

| 2:52:00| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10320)|
| 2:52:01| I'm going to ask Council Frost to tell us about the charter and ordinance that requires us to pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10321)|
| 2:52:09| on first reading even though we're having our hearings on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10334)|
| 2:52:15| Section 901, I believe it's Article Roman Numeral 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| It's whatever I put in the e-mail to you all earlier today that it's required to be passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| Then we'll have our budget hearings a week from today, as Vice Mayor Pavlis mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10344)|
| 2:52:31| So the approval tees up the ability to have the hearings and we'll pick apart the budget then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10351)|
| 2:52:35| Well, it can be discussed at the budget workshop and anything can be suggested upon second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10355)|
| 2:52:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10363)|
| 2:52:44| Is Tuesday going to be a long day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| I didn't want to see the Mayor faint when I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| What's this picking apart we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| Maybe analyze it closely would be a better phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| And we encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10376)|

| 2:53:27| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10407)|
| 2:53:28| I don't know if Jim York is there, but, yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| But, Jim, I understand from this paperwork that when they finally get done with the reappraisal through the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10411)|
| 2:53:38| appraisal system, the tax rate may have to be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| But we're going forward with the $246 per hundred right now with the notion that we may have to adapt as the numbers come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10422)|
| 2:53:53| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10433)|
| 2:53:57| What this ordinance does is adopt a $2.46 tax levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10437)|
| 2:54:05| Once we get the final numbers from the assessor and have the state certify a tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10445)|
| 2:54:13| we will bring back an ordinance that gives you the certified equivalent to a $2.46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10453)|
| 2:54:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10460)|
| 2:54:21| The number might change, but it's revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| In other words, you match the appraisal with the rate to get the same dollar input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10469)|
| 2:54:30| Now, again, I do expect that it will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| I don't think it's going to change very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| But it will change, and it will be revenue neutral for existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10477)|
| 2:54:42| We will be able to add the value for any properties that have come on the roll, new properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10482)|
| 2:54:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10489)|

| 2:55:16| She might have something to say to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10516)|

| 2:57:56| Councilman Dallivaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| Is Mark Donaldson still awake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| Yes, he's on the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| I understand that this was a residential use and they want to stay with residential as opposed to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| and that sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| Why are we choosing medium density since it seems to say it's basically a dwelling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| Why isn't it low density residential is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| Because the zoning on the property immediately to the west, to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10699)|
| 2:58:27| is R2 with medium density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| So this property is consistent with the adjacent properties, or the request is consistent with adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10712)|
| 2:58:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| I was just curious because it says it's a detached dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| That sounds like a single family operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| We have vast amounts of land within the city that's zoned R2 but built with houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10725)|
| 2:58:54| So it's consistency is the theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10735)|

| 3:00:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10837)|
| 3:00:38| So that we do not have a prolonged discussion, Mr. Swanson, I believe, has figured out how to handle L-M&N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10838)|
| 3:00:46| That was going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10846)|
| 3:00:47| Tell us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| L-M&N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| I think I've got it figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| So, Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Frost, if you'll listen and make sure that I don't mess this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| But if I get this right, here's what I think you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| First, I think you want to divide the question as to there are two parcels of property affected by this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10859)|
| 3:01:06| So if you move first to divide the question between those two parcels of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10866)|
| 3:01:12| then the next thing you're going to want to do is postpone as to parcel 106-KB-02-602, which is the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10872)|
| 3:01:20| And then after you've done that, you'll address the second part of that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| and you'll move to approve, I think, the ordinance as to parcel 106-KB-02-603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10884)|
| 3:01:33| Do you fellows think I've got that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10896)|
| 3:01:37| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10897)|
| 3:01:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| So that's three different motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| The next thing we need is a motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10903)|
| 3:01:44| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| We have a motion and a second to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| Now we need a motion to postpone as to parcel 106-KB-02-602, the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10913)|
| 3:01:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10919)|
| 3:02:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10920)|
| 3:02:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10921)|
| 3:02:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| We've got to say how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| He needs 30 days' notice, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| Plus your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10931)|
| 3:02:12| This quite literally could be until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10932)|
| 3:02:16| That might affect the mayor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| We can't get the plan amendment on June, so it will have to go to July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10938)|
| 3:02:24| which within our normal rhythm brings it to the council in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10944)|
| 3:02:32| Does Mr. Holt have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| What are we today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| If we could postpone for four council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10959)|
| 3:02:44| and if need be, postpone beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10966)|
| 3:02:47| Postpone for 48 days and bring it back, and then we'll see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| We may be able to double notice and shorten it by two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10971)|
| 3:02:56| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| So the motion is to postpone 48 days on that particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| Does that work for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10982)|
| 3:03:04| Mr. Holt, is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10986)|
| 3:03:07| Is it 24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10987)|
| 3:03:08| Is it 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| I don't do numbers very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10993)|
| 3:03:14| It's 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10994)|
| 3:03:15| Okay, 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10995)|
| 3:03:16| Four times 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| Okay, it's 56 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| My wife will tell you, I just don't do numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| You divide everything by three, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| You can get a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11004)|
| 3:03:25| Okay, this is to postpone 56 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11010)|

| 3:03:35| Now we need a motion to approve as to parcel 106KB02603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11021)|

| 3:04:01| And we can't have a consolidated three-motion motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| We've got to break it, play with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| Okay, we're going to do this quickly, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11045)|

| 3:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11240)|
| 3:07:21| That brings us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| And Mr. Kevin Murphy has had the patience to sit here all this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11243)|
| 3:07:26| three hours and six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| So, Mr. Murphy, I hate to tell you, but we only give you five minutes by council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| He's thrilled to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11253)|
| 3:07:34| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| Thank you, Madam Mayor, Mr. Vice Mayor, Mayor Brown, and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| I appreciate the opportunity to address you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| I'm here as a representative of Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11261)|
| 3:07:46| Northeast Knox Preservation Association, and my own family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11266)|
| 3:07:50| Concerning a project that's going on to widen Washington Pike from the I-640 to Murphy Road interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11270)|
| 3:07:58| I'll just give you the very briefest bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| In 2011, our neighborhood associations noticed there had been a transportation planning report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11282)|
| 3:08:08| and we started to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| We met with Tom Clabo in the Lorain Street offices to get some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11290)|
| 3:08:14| We were told this project was going to be a number of years, not really much happening with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| In early 2012, I noticed on a city council agenda that an item had been passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| allocating funds to CDM Smith to start planning on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11302)|
| 3:08:26| And so we made a request to the city, and Mr. Hagerman came out in, I think, April or March or April of 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11306)|
| 3:08:34| and addressed Alice Bell and gave us an overview of what the project was and some of the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| And so we said, that's interesting, and we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| and we said, we've got some concerns around what this project of pipelining Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11320)|
| 3:08:47| means to northeast Knox County, what the impacts are on the Tazewell Pike corridor area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| on the Millertown Pike around the mall where a 2009 study said there were also some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| So we said, you know, we had some concerns across the city, county boundaries, transportation planning office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11337)|
| 3:09:03| So we asked for a meeting with Mayor O'Hara and some others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| and we had that meeting May 31st of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| And since then, we've been waiting for a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| We brought these issues up, and that was 348 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| I finally got a response this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11358)|
| 3:09:23| So I think I'm expressing a bit of frustration on behalf of Alice Bell Spring Hill as well as northeast Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11363)|
| 3:09:30| It's taking this long to get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| I know that there has been some work around the environmental impact analysis on this project that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11372)|
| 3:09:39| I've seen a report on historical structures impact and historical area impact that's been done by the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11379)|
| 3:09:49| It's interesting, they've got a letter that I sent to Mr. Hagerman back in 2012 saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| I want to be involved in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11394)|
| 3:09:55| Please keep me informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| And besides the one meeting that we had where he came to Alice Bell Spring Hill and we had with Mayor O'Hara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11397)|
| 3:10:03| I haven't had any kind of contact whatsoever until finally getting a full response today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11403)|
| 3:10:11| And I'm listed as an interested party, so is Northeast Knox Preservation Association, East Tennessee Preservation Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11411)|
| 3:10:19| In the response today, I was told that the state had sent copies of this report to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| but none of us have received that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| So what I'm here to do today is really just tell you that the neighborhood associations would like to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11426)|
| 3:10:32| We would like to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| We've asked for some documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11436)|
| 3:10:38| I see there's a couple of reports that have been posted up on the city website, but there's a lot of stuff that's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11438)|
| 3:10:44| And really, you know, we're paying good money to an outside consultant to help with the planning here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11444)|
| 3:10:50| but not all the I's are getting dotted, not all the T's are getting crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| We're not getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| So it's a plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11455)|
| 3:10:56| It's a frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| This is sort of our last event of recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| Councilman Della Volpe has been trying to carry some significant water for us over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| and he's had some meetings with the county and around Millertown Pike improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| so we've made some improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11469)|
| 3:11:10| But the neighborhood associations would really appreciate some more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11470)|
| 3:11:14| So we're asking tonight that, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11474)|
| 3:11:16| certainly a representative comes to the next Islesdale Spring Hill Neighborhood Association meeting from the city to talk to us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| Two, we're asking that we get all the project documentation out and posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11482)|
| 3:11:28| There's a number of reports that, yeah, there is a historical impact report that has been generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11488)|
| 3:11:34| but that's not available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11494)|
| 3:11:35| We'd love to see that along with other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| And finally, just city counseling, I know there will be some requests for funding that come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11497)|
| 3:11:43| and this one, look through with a little bit of scrutiny and check with us to see if we've been involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=11503)|
