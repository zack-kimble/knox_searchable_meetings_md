| 0:00:00| Yes, sir. That is a officer initiated incident? Yes, sir. What about a, I'm sorry a 10-43, that's an investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=0)|
| 0:00:25| That's an officer investigation, yes, sir. Yes. It could be this, I'm going into Michael's and look around. I can't possibly answer to what an officer would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=25)|
| 0:00:37| Well, can you explain why there is a complete disproportionate number of officer initiated incidents and investigations of Michael's to any other establishment within the corporate limits of Knoxville, Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=37)|
| 0:01:01| Objection. Assume facts, not in evidence. I will sustain that objection, but if you want to lay a proper foundation for it, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=61)|
| 0:01:09| Well, you're in charge of the stings, aren't you? Of the underage stings? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| Yes, sir. Okay. Now, you know what's going on with the underage stings. Can you tell me why it is that Michael's has 42 of these type of stings as opposed to Cool Beans that only had 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=74)|
| 0:01:34| 42 type of what stings? Underage stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| I'm not aware of 42 stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| How many stings did Michael's have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| At what period are you talking about, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| When these citations begin to arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| You'd have to ask me the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Well, how many citations did you not issue? In other words, how many times did you do an underage sting and the server asked for identification and was found to be under 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=113)|
| 0:02:06| I can't possibly answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| Well, that has happened, hasn't it, at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| Ask me the question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Yes, it has happened that you have sent in an underage person to Michael's and asked them to purchase alcohol or beer, and they've done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=136)|
| 0:02:31| And they were asked to produce an ID, and it was shown that they were under 21 and was refused alcohol. That has happened, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=151)|
| 0:02:40| Sir, this is the first sting that I've been in charge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Of the stings of which your department is aware of, how many citations were not issued at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| Sir, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Well, how many stings did they pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| At what time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| During the period of time that she introduced the exhibit for ID of these past actions, the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| I believe last year the inspections unit visited Michael's twice in 2006, if I can recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=189)|
| 0:03:21| And one was a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| And the other one was a no sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Now, what is the number of passing stings in relationship to the other establishments in this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=209)|
| 0:03:40| I don't have that information in front of me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| I have close to 700 beer permits out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Do you have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Can you get that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| And be specific and ask me again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Can you provide this board with the information of the number of passing stings by Michael's in comparison with the other establishments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=232)|
| 0:04:01| I don't object to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Of course it's relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| I don't have it laid out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| I have all the records from when we visit a place or places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| It's recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| I have hard copies of whether they sold or not and whether they ID or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Can you tell us why at Kingston Alley and at Hooters in West Knoxville, instead of issuing citations, warnings are issued and a no citation is given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=263)|
| 0:04:36| Sir, if you're referring to an underage sting, there is no warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| If I produced a warning document, it would just cause you to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| If it's an underage sting that I'm talking about, we don't give warnings if they sell to our underage cadet or explorer or our person we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| We do not give a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| You'll stake your personal, professional reputation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| It's argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| He also answered the question he asked the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| The purpose is to try to get these establishments in compliance with the law relative to underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=318)|
| 0:05:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| On those stings, it is to assure that they are doing the right thing and they're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| That's the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| The purpose is not to drive a business out of business, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| That would be an improper and clearly an illegal reason for such a sting operation, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| I don't know that that would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| It wouldn't be a legitimate law enforcement action, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| I don't know that it would be illegal, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Well, is that within your assignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| It's not our practice, if that's what you're asking me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Is it part of your assignment to drive a business into banishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| If it was, I believe we would have hit it more than twice last year, if that's what you're asking me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Well, what about the year before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| It was two or three or one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Why are the officers trained that when they pull a person over, for example, that's in these citations, to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| and it's clearly on some of these videos, not where have you been drinking, but have you been drinking at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=398)|
| 0:06:48| That's not a question on our form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| No, it's not a question on your form, but you don't ask the question that's on the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| You ask them, have you been drinking at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| I'm going to object to lack of personal knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| If he wants to ask him what he asks, that's fine, but if he's going to ask what other officers ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| I don't think Officer Husky has knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| He's asking the question in a way where he hasn't established that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| He's assuming facts, not in evidence at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| So you can ask it another way, but you can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| We're familiar with the patrol area, the saturation patrols in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| Saturation patrols?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| in West Knoxville, depending upon the statistical data that's fed to the Knoxville Police Department from the 911 emergency center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| For example, if you get a rash of purse snatchings at West Town, you canvass West Town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| If you get a rash of home burglaries, you canvass the area where there's home burglaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| If you get a rash of drunk drivers, you canvass the area where there's reports of drunk drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Is that not what police departments do anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| I answer yes to your question of the burglaries and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| I don't remember what the other one was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| But not drunk drivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| You're talking about a certain road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Sir, I'm not in those patrol meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| I'm out of patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=487)|
| 0:08:21| Do you have this young lady, Miss Hager-Bowman's test scores there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=501)|
| 0:08:41| Yes, sir, from the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Did you call Michael's up and tell Mr. Rick, say, hey, I've got a girl down here who just barely passed the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=524)|
| 0:08:55| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Well, in other words, the Knoxville Police Department knew more about her ability as a server than the young employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=537)|
| 0:09:13| The Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Yeah, you knew more, but you knew that she barely passed the class and you didn't tell Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| This girl's not doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I object as to the mischaracterization of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| My understanding from the sheet is that she got a 94, and the last time I was in class, 94 was an A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=564)|
| 0:09:31| It's not barely passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| I'm going to have to sustain the objection because there's been nothing shown that he would know whether they have more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| or whether the police department has more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| So it would be speculation on his part, and I'm going to sustain the objection on that ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Well, by looking at her test scores, did you deem Miss Hager-Bowman competent to read the dates of birth when she completed the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=588)|
| 0:09:57| Sir, this is the first time I've actually looked at her test score and compared them to the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| You're the one that introduced it, and she's the one that represented to everybody here that you're the one that had knowledge about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| and you were the competent witness to introduce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| I don't sit there and look at the test scores, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Well, why were you introducing documents you know nothing about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| I do know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Okay, look at her test score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| The only person that scored lower is a person that doesn't understand English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| If you're asking me if he understands English, I have no way of knowing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| So the document says what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| Now, did you get your $30 back from your cadet and your $30 back from your certified officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| I got $30 from my officer and $30 from my explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| Did you seize the wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| The beverage that was said to be a wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Taste it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=662)|

| 0:18:03| I know that because she signed in on the course and also attended the course for five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| That day, on December 7, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1091)|

| 0:18:18| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| How do you remember her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| It was a small class, nine students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| She was from Michaels, and I had not taught somebody from Michaels in quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1103)|

| 0:18:46| and I also utilized a handout that I developed to emphasize the importance of checking IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| before serving or selling alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1133)|

| 0:19:07| Is this nine and ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| These are two separate documents, so we'd ask that they be marked separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| The PowerPoint is nine, and the document entitled Checking IDs, Ten Steps, is Exhibit 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1156)|
| 0:19:25| We have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| We have a few extras that we're asking to be passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1169)|
| 0:19:38| Lieutenant Rulewich, I'm going to direct your attention to the Top Ten document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| This is one of the written documents you provide in the class when you teach the Ask course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Was this provided in the course that Michaela Huggleboom took?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| How do you go over this Top Ten list with the participants of the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Well, I ask the students to bring a valid form of ID, preferably a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| I ask the students to take out their driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and then what I do is as I instruct the class the ten steps of checking an ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| I have them go over their own driver's license with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| to make sure they're clear on the basic ten steps and the importance of checking an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| And if you go through these ten steps, one of the steps, number one, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| what's the first thing you taught them that day on that ten step list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Well, we asked the student to ask the customer to please remove their identification from the billfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Why is that important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Well, number one, it's important because that way it allows the server to place it in their hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and that way you can read both the front and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| It also allows you to scrutinize the identification a little closer by touching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| feeling it, making sure that it's not a false ID or fraudulent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| And do you talk about the fact that the under 21 IDs have a red bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Yes, we do go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| And did you go over that in Michaela's course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| I believe you said this class was five hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| By state law and policy, it must be five hours, 10 a.m. until 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| And did Michaela stay for the entire class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Yes, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| How do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Well, she took the final exam that we offer at the end of the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| and she did receive a certificate of graduation from the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1286)|
| 0:21:57| I'm showing you two documents, and they're going to be marked 11 and 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| And I'm not sure which one is 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1324)|
| 0:22:13| Is 11 the exam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Yes, the 11 is the exam that we administer at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| that all the students are required to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| And this was the test that Michaela Huggaboom took?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| And the last page of that document is her test key?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Her test score, I guess her test sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| And the next document that's been marked as Exhibit 12 is the test key to that test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1358)|
| 0:22:47| Next page for the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Test question number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| Asking for proper identification to determine the age of the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| does not fulfill your responsibility as a server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| You must verify that the identification is valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| and prove that the customer is 21 years of age or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| True or false, then, is the answers to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And what is the answer to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| The answer is A, true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Would you turn to Michaela Huggaboom's test sheet and look at number 37?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| Which one did she mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So she got that question correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| What do you do with these test results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| At the end of the day, once we administer the test, they have passed the test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| we hand out their certificate of diploma or graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| we then turn the test answer sheets over to the inspectors there in the beverage office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1424)|
| 0:23:53| And are these test scores forwarded to anyone other than the inspectors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| At that point, then, they are forwarded on to the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| so those students that are wanting to receive a server card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| may do so through the Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Are you allowed to serve alcoholic beverages just by taking this course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Under the law, you must continue, if you're serving liquor or wine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| to go and actually physically go down to the TABC office, pay $5, show a picture ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1460)|
| 0:24:29| and then at that time, because you've been administered this course, passed the test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| then you would be receiving your server card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Then that would allow you to serve liquor and wine in the state of Tennessee for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| You mentioned the course lasts five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| How much time in that course do you spend with them about how to check IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Approximately 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Oh, actually, hold on one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1497)|
| 0:25:07| Just in case I didn't ask before, the number one on the top ten was to take the ID out of the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| Do you recall if you instructed the class that Michaela attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| that that was the first thing that you should do is ask the customer to take the ID out of the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| Yes, that is step number one, and I did cover it in the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| That Michaela attended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Counselor, I don't believe you've moved the admission of exhibits nine through whatever the last number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| I apologize. That is something I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| You recognize all of those documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| We would ask that those be admitted into evidence at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| Objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I'm ruling on that until I go back and look at them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| I think most of them, may I just approach the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Oh, he has them over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Yes, Mr. Bell, I have them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| Jim or James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Ten, eleven, twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| No objection? All right, they will be received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Exhibits nine through, what was the last one, thirteen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Twelve, nine through twelve. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| If you'll just leave them there, he may need to refer to them in your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| Exactly right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| If you needed that last remark to be on our record, we probably didn't pick it up on a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1599)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1609)|
| 0:26:59| We'll wait for both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1620)|
| 0:27:11| I have just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1631)|
| 0:27:38| Are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1658)|
| 0:27:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1671)|
| 0:28:01| Lieutenant, I want to ask you a few questions about hopefully limited to two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1681)|
| 0:28:10| One is when she completed this class, did you notify Michaels that she was second, the last, next to last in her comparison to the other attendees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1690)|
| 0:28:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Did you alert Michaels Corporation that she did poorly, that is, she did not satisfactorily answer each and every question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1709)|
| 0:28:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Now, of the attendees, over the course of a year, did most people grade out higher than what this young lady graded out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1728)|
| 0:28:59| That's hard to say without having all the test scores in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| The test scores you have in front of you in this particular class, it looks like she came in next to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1743)|
| 0:29:12| You know what your test scores are in the other classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Is that a representative test score for all your classes that go from 90 to 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| So 90 would be generally your lowest score and 100 would be your best score?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Yes, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| And did you say anything to this lady about her or the attendees at all about they must have their vision periodically checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1775)|
| 0:29:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| I noticed your PowerPoint does not discuss the visual acuity of the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| You don't wear glasses, do you, Lieutenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Actually, I wear contact lenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| There is a difference between contacts and glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Me, who are cheap, go to Walmart or wherever, I've got these magnifiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1817)|
| 0:30:27| You wear contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| When you haven't had your contacts in, do you find it difficult to read perfectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1833)|
| 0:30:42| Back to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| What is the relevance of whether he can read well with his contacts in or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Well, do you discuss with the in your class, and that's probably a correct thing in hours late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| but do you discuss with the attendees the necessity about the human frailties of sight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1860)|
| 0:31:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1876)|
| 0:31:28| You wouldn't condemn a person who made an honest mistake, would you, in misreading or misinterpreting a document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1888)|
| 0:31:38| Back to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| How is it relevant whether he would condemn someone for making a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Well, this lady looked at an ID and obviously according to the documents the city says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| What relevance does it have to this case as to whether or not he would condemn her or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| He's a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| I'm not sure that his condemnation of anybody has any relevance to this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1918)|
| 0:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Police officers have discretion, do they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Street level discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| And that discretion is vested within the sound idea of the person who is authoring the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1935)|
| 0:32:27| Fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| For example, I'll drive out here at 32 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| You may exercise your street discretion and not write a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| You may just give me a warning, say, slow down Jim, you're going too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Some people you may decide, well, they need a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Discretionary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| If someone misreads a driver's license, you've looked at hundreds of them I take it, 25, 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1975)|
| 0:33:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| You ever misread one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| You didn't get cited for it, did you, or charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I object to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| If someone made an honest mistake, and you knew that, for example, in the misreading of an eight versus a three, they do look alike, do they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=1998)|
| 0:33:41| It depends on the person viewing the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Now, in your teaching of your class, you know that 19, or I'm sorry, 2008 is a very important year because 2003, I'm sorry, 1983 would trigger the 21-year cutoff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2026)|
| 0:34:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Do you teach that in your class to be particularly painfully aware when somebody was born in 83 or 88?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Where is it in your documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| In the document, and I forget which item is labeled what numbers, but it's the checking, the ten steps of checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2064)|
| 0:34:34| One of those steps is to check the date of birth, and that is when we go over the importance of checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| In particular, if you'll note on there, on the handout, that we have 1985 because that is of great importance as that is what we're looking for to establish the age of the customer, making sure they are 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2082)|
| 0:34:59| Bob, you and I have been friends for 25, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| So the question I was about to ask is, you know, I'm not trying to embarrass you, but you've been in a beer establishment at night such as Michael's, have you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2104)|
| 0:35:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Let's just talk about the real atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| I mean, the real atmosphere, the lights are down, the lights are low, and it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| I'm going to object to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| He's not the one that issued the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| He's not the one that served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| He's the one that teaches the class to the servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| He's the instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And you know from personal experience that if we lower the candle power in this room, that obviously you can misread something by mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2137)|
| 0:35:51| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Okay, do you discuss lighting conditions with the servers in your training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Do you tell them to carry a flashlight around their neck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| On some occasions I have mentioned that a flashlight could be a useful tool under certain circumstances, that of low lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| Yes, I've actually covered that in several of my classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| But not in this particular class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I do not recall, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| And magnifying glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Do you tell them to use the magnifying glass you can buy and wear them around your neck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I recommend a magnifying glass to locate the third date of birth that's hidden in the Tennessee flagpole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| It's a security code on the current Tennessee driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Where is that in the training material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| I include that in the section under date of birth where I go into specifics looking for those three date of births.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2197)|
| 0:36:45| That's in the exhibits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Now, let me go to the other, the second area I wanted to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| You're in charge of assignments of patrol based upon complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| That is one aspect of my job, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Well, my job as a supervisor is to investigate any and all complaints made by citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| by talking with the citizens, reviewing the call or case, reviewing the videotape and the audible tape of the officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2233)|
| 0:37:23| and any interested parties, any witnesses, any other fellow officers that might be there at the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2243)|
| 0:37:32| Mr. Bell, you need to be on the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2252)|
| 0:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2262)|
| 0:37:55| I just happen to bring with me a few of your records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2275)|
| 0:38:06| And what you do, you get these complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| They come in various.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I'm going to object at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| This is outside the scope of direct, and it's certainly not relevant to this hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| I haven't heard the question yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Tell me where he's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Talking about investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| In preparing for the assignments of the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| you use various information that comes into the Knoxville Police Department from an infinite variety of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| from citizens' complaints, 911 calls, to different methods in which they're received, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| Has this witness testified that he sends people out on stings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| He testifies that he dispatches areas of patrol based upon complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I supervise the officers that answer the calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Answering calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| And your question is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And you do that based on data that comes to the Knoxville Police Department in various forms or by various methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Now, from that information, the Knoxville Police Department determines statistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2362)|
| 0:39:31| where a particular crime is more likely than not to occur in order to protect and serve the public, true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| And so it's a prophylactic or preventive type law enforcement situation from your assignment position, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2379)|
| 0:39:49| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Then can you tell me, for example, based on the assignments and based upon the knowledge that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2392)|
| 0:40:05| how it is that Michaels would have an inordinate number of officer-initiated incidents compared to all the other beverage places in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2405)|
| 0:40:24| I would not be able to answer that because my area of supervision is the East District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| and Michaels falls in the West District, which I have no responsibility for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| If you're in charge of that, who's the alter ego to you for the West sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| My counterpart would be Lieutenant Ron Green on Squad A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| Then we'll save these questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2447)|
| 0:41:04| That's all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Real quickly, just a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Mr. Bell was asking you about the birth dates and how you can confuse the 1988 and 1983, possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| because your eyes are scratchy from contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| You discussed the big red bar that says under 21 on the ID, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| In one of the test questions, Mr. Bell brought up the fact that sometimes it could be dark in a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| and you might not be able to fully ascertain the age on an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| Can you read test question number 13 if you have it in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Loud to the board members, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| Test question number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| If you're not absolutely convinced a person is at least 21 years old, you should not serve them alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| A, true. B, false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| And the correct answer is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| If you wouldn't mind turning to the test question results for Michaela for question number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| That bit of evidence was turned back in over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| I don't currently have a copy of her test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| The exhibit was turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Yeah, I'd be happy to look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Actually, I don't know if that's the right one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| No, this would be the test key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| There's another exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| What was the answer that Michaela gave on that test question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| Test question 13 of Michaela was true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| She answered it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| No recalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Are there any clarifying questions for this witness from the beer board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Seeing none, the witness may be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Do you have additional witnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| I would note that the time is 1144.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| We are about to be over the time limit for the introduction of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| I believe we have a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| Your Honor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Your Honor, with them having two more witnesses...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| It's actually three, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Having three more witnesses and we're fast approaching the time, how are we to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| The rule allows the city to request additional time if cross-examination has been lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| and I think on some of these witnesses it has been quite lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| so we would ask for a little bit of latitude on that length of period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| I would request that you keep these witnesses as brief as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| and we'll keep this same consideration in mind when the other side puts their proof on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| Do we not get the same amount of time that the city got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| You're going to get the same amount of time they got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| My question is, here it is almost midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| Most mortals are not going to be able to receive and digest this type of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2665)|
| 0:44:34| In fact, this very practice of running midnight courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| has been condemned by the Tennessee Supreme Court as being oppressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| and it was a case out of Sevier County involving Judge Kenneth Porter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| who eventually ran cases to 6 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| You don't need to cite chapter and verse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| You just ask us to postpone it to another time and you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| I'm not asking you to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| What I'm asking this board to do is to limit the introduction of their testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2702)|
| 0:45:11| and allow us a reasonable opportunity to respond to what they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| because what we have so far is the introduction of a purported sting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| where no purchase was actually made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| Money was never made to buy this alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| And if that's the end of the case, that's the end of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| It can't get any better for us than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| And so I don't see any necessity just to continue on over this one particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| Mr. Bell, I've been trying to keep track of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| and certainly the cross-examination has been longer than the direct examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| on each of the witnesses to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| That's always true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| The rules very specifically provide that if the time is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| let me see what it says specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| the beer board upon motion by either party but at the board's sole option may grant either party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| additional time upon a finding that the opposing party unduly restricted the available time for proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| through extensive cross-examination of the other party's witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| as may be required in fairness to each of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| The city has requested additional time based on that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| We are granting the additional time, and we will show the same consideration to your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| So if you're asking about having equal time, we're going to give you equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| If you're saying that the members of the beer board cannot give appropriate attention to the proof because of the late hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| I am willing for you to make a motion at any time to suspend this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| and take it up at another time when everyone is fresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Because our ordinance provides that you have a right to have a hearing at the next beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| and you have that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| But the problem you've put us in, Mr. Swanson, and most respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| and you know I have a good deal of respect for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| but as an advocate, you've put us in the worst legal position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| Could you speak into the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| You've put us into the worst legal position of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| You're holding this permit at hostage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| knowing full well that there's another hearing Thursday that's codependent upon this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2851)|
| 0:47:39| and we've got witnesses to-we may not have put on any witnesses at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2859)|
| 0:47:49| but, you know, you want us to delay this, but you won't give us our permit back in order to delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| We will attempt to give you a hearing before your Thursday hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| but no, you will not get your permit back until this hearing is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| and the beer board has had an opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| So it's really your call to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| You're saying that you would adjourn this or recess it until sometime tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| What's tomorrow? Wednesday? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| May I confer a moment? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2905)|
| 0:48:51| Can I make an inquiry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I guess what I would like to do is have a chamber's conference with you, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2933)|
| 0:49:01| so we can do that if we have some ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| I've been suggesting that we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| I want to make sure that we can have a quorum of the beer board members present tomorrow at, say, 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| Is there anyone who cannot be here at 430 tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| I would feel more comfortable with 5 o'clock. I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| About 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Anyone who cannot be here at 5 o'clock tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| Three members of the beer board cannot be here at 5 o'clock tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| So we would have a quorum of the beer board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| We would not have the entire beer board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Well, okay. Can we confer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Mr. Frost can be here at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Six will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Everybody can be here at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I was going to suggest, Mr. Chairman, that we ask the ones that can't be here tomorrow how they plan to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=2998)|
| 0:50:08| Perhaps we won't do that, Mr. Leavitt. It may be a bit premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| I think I've just gotten an indication that everyone can be here by 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| So we'll take five minutes for a chamber's conference, no longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| It won't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| It won't take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3023)|
| 0:51:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3072)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3092)|
| 0:52:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3122)|
| 0:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3152)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3182)|
| 0:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3212)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3242)|
| 0:54:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I'm going to state this for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Is the recorder going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Core reporter ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Are the lawyers ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| I'm just going to state for the record the agreement that was reached in the chamber's conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| And that agreement, as I understand it, is that the city has one additional witness to present tonight who cannot be here tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| And the city is going to present that one additional witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| We will conclude that witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| And after we have concluded with that witness, the parties agree and stipulate that we will recess this hearing then until 6 p.m. tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3288)|
| 0:54:58| We may have to find a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| I do not know if this room is available or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| If this room is not available, I will try to find us a courtroom that we could meet in, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| that would be more amenable to this type of proceeding than this room might be anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I'll try to find us some room that we can meet in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| And we'll get word of that to you tomorrow just as quickly as we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Is that the agreement, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Is that the agreement, Mr. Kizer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| It is, Mr. Swanson, but there's one matter incident to that that I think that none of us thought of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and I would like to make sure it's clear, and that is the suspension remains in place pending that hearing, the conclusion of this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| I understand that to be part of the agreement, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| You understand that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| I understand you don't agree with it, but you understand that as part of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Well, yeah, that's, I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| You're opposed to that, I understand, and you want to state that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| The city calls Robert Lee Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| Mr. Graham, were you previously sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Your answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Mr. Graham, you might need to lean a little bit close to that microphone so it can pick up your voice, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| State your full name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Robert Lee Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| How old are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Thirty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| What county do you reside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Did you know a gentleman named Jonathan Frederick Hatcher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Did you recall the event of his death on May 15, 2006?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| Were you with him in the early morning hours of that day before the automobile accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Where were you with Mr. Hatcher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| At Michael's Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| Use the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| We would object to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| This is a matter that's currently in litigation before Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3418)|
| 0:57:08| Mr. Swanson, it is in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| It's set forth in the, I think, third amended complaint, which is part of Exhibit 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| The fact of the matter is I would anticipate that if this proof doesn't come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| I can anticipate Mr. Bell saying later on, okay, we just have one underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| What's this all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| There's more to it than one underage, and that's what the city wants to show through this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Well, they've chosen their forum, and they can't have their cake and eat it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| Their forum's with Mr. Petty, not before this august body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| I agree that the forum is with Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| But the issue in this case is whether the beer board believes that the suspension should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| the emergency suspension should stay in effect until that hearing occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| And I believe that the testimony that's being offered goes to that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| And so I'm going to respectfully overrule your objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| My question then becomes, I know from talking to Dalton Townsend and the other lawyers involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3491)|
| 0:58:27| that they have thousands of pages of depositions in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3507)|
| 0:58:35| Surely the city can find some less engaging document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| because there are issues here that go to the matter of causation, approximate cause, contributing cause, and all kinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3522)|
| 0:58:57| I mean, you know, their answer is two inches thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| And that's why they entered the complaint that we objected to at the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3541)|
| 0:59:12| to show that there was other incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| So, you know, for them to hash and try here, and you sustained it once, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3555)|
| 0:59:25| to try cases before Mr. Petty, the hearing officer, is just not the due process that a citizen or a business owner is entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3565)|
| 0:59:36| It's not minimal due process, as your rules discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3576)|
| 0:59:44| You're asking me to anticipate issues of proof that we haven't come to yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| What he's trying is this wrongful death case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| No, we're not going to try a wrongful death case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| But if there are issues that the Beer Board needs to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| with regard to whether or not there is a basis to issue an emergency suspension of the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| that should stay in effect until the hearing before the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| who will hear all the issues related to that particular incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| then I think that's something that the law department needs to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| whether they're going to put that on or not put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| I've got to tell you that this witness was examined for 194 pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3622)|
| 1:00:39| and introduced 16 exhibits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3639)|
| 1:00:48| and this is not the shortest witness they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| We had an agreement he was going to put on a short witness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| and now he's wanting to try a vehicular homicide case, a dram shop case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| that's already before Mr. Petty, and it's wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| and we ask you to strike it and disallow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| Mr. Swanson, this is a witness who can't be here tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| and I could have been done with his direct testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| and had time to sit down and listen to his cross-examination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| but for Mr. Bell's comments right now, this proof will move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| A lawyer has a duty to object, and a lawyer must object when called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| I think his sidebar comments allow him not to object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| Well, the hour is late and we're all a little testy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| but at this moment I do not have a sound basis to rule out this testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| and so, Mr. Kaiser, if you would proceed with this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| Mr. Graham, you stated you saw Mr. Hatcher in the early morning hours of May 15, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| Where was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Michael's Restaurant and Bar on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| What time did you get to Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Around 12 a.m., 12.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| And when you arrived there, did you see Mr. Hatcher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| And where was he, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| He was sitting at the bar with a drink in his hand when I seen him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| Was it a mixed drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| It appeared to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| While you were sitting there, did you hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Hold on one minute, Mr. Kaiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Because this is something that the beer board members don't typically do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| when we sustain an objection to a question like that where the question has already been answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| you should know that you should not consider the answer that was given to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| You should do your best to strike that information from your memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| because the hearing officer has ruled that it is inadmissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| Well, my objection to that instruction is not they should do their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| They must strike it from their recollection and not consider it for any purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| What sort of glass was it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| The regular glass that they make their mixed drinks in that mine served in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| While you were there at the bar with him, did you hear him speak to the bartender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Did you hear him order a drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| What did he order from the bartender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Jack and Coke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Now, this is rank hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| Rank hearsay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| He heard the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| There's no hearsay associated with that, Mr. Sloan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| That's what makes it hearsay that he heard the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| It wasn't his own statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| The fact that a statement's made doesn't make it hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| It's the example of the store manager saying the ketchup is spilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| The ketchup is spilled on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| It's not hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| The words themselves have legal relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Objection is overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Did the server, did the bartender ask Mr. Hatcher for his ID after he ordered the Jack and Coke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Did Mr. Hatcher say anything to the bartender about his age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| He made comment that he was only 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| How far was he from the bartender when he made those comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| I'd say probably about three foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| Was he, in fact, served that Jack and Coke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| When you say Jack and Coke, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Jack Daniels mixed with Coca-Cola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| That's an alcoholic drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Did you, shortly after that or some period of time after that, did you see Jonathan around the vicinity of the dart board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Is that in the bar area there at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| It's off to the side of the second bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| What did you observe about him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| He had what appeared to be puke on his T-shirt and his shorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| Did he have a conversation at that time with a server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| What did you hear him tell the server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| He made the same comment to the server that he was only 20 and not 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| Did he order a drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Did the server check an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3912)|

| 1:05:57| Did you go out in the parking lot and look for his car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Now, what time did you leave Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| I left Michael's at 2.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| That's when I went out the door and noticed his car gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3969)|

| 1:06:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3977)|

| 1:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| When you were in the vicinity of IC King Park, what did you observe on your side of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| On my side of the road, on the right-hand side, I seen debris from what appeared to be a wreck and a guardrail missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3988)|
| 1:06:37| And what time was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| It was probably around 3.30 a.m. to 4.00 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=3999)|
| 1:06:48| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Mr. Graham, I want to ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| If you don't understand me, ask me to explain it, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| I believe you've indicated under oath before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| You've given testimony about this matter under oath before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| At some length with some lawyers in the civil case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| One of the things you told the lawyers there under your oath, the God that you gave here the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| is that Michaels had an excellent reputation based upon your knowledge for carting individuals who were being served alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4050)|
| 1:07:43| I made a comment to them not to that statement, but I did make a statement similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4063)|
| 1:07:51| And that based on your experience with Michaels, Michaels also had an excellent reputation not only for carting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| but that if a person appeared to be overindulging, that Michaels had a policy of cutting one off from further service of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4078)|
| 1:08:09| You did say that, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Yes, because they've cut me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| And also, Michaels had an excellent reputation of offering to provide a customer with water or Cokes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4094)|
| 1:08:24| or some sort of other nonalcoholic beverage for free if it appeared that the person had overindulged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4104)|
| 1:08:32| That's what you told those lawyers under oath, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| I told them water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| And that during the year 2002 to 2004, you was working at the time of this gentleman's death at the Last Chance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4119)|
| 1:09:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| So that the members of the Beer Board will understand what is, and for the record, what is the Last Chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4150)|
| 1:09:18| It's an adult theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| Okay. And I believe Mr. Hatcher worked with you, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Okay. And there were times during his employee with you that you witnessed him having beer in the car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4172)|
| 1:09:42| On one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| And I believe you also may have found out during your relationship with him, he had a number of illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4184)|
| 1:09:57| and was on medication for different ailments of the body. Did you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| Okay. And that this gentleman also, that this gentleman had been diagnosed with having Parkinson's disease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4207)|
| 1:10:30| I did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| I did notice his hands shaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Is your answer no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Now, I believe, and I'm not trying to embarrass you with this, the stuff you told these other lawyer people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4238)|
| 1:10:55| is that your criminal history includes the fact that you have pled guilty in criminal court for auto burglary on two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4255)|
| 1:11:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| Mr. Swanson, that's not relevant unless it was in the last ten years. I don't know the issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| In the last ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| It's older than ten years, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Mr. Swanson, I would request that the Board not consider that under the rules about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| I don't know if these lawyers asked this. I was given this deposition tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Well, you're not in a position to rebut it, so I assume that we will take his testimony as he has given it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| and I will sustain that objection and instruct the Beer Board to not consider the last statement of the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4305)|
| 1:12:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4335)|
| 1:12:30| Young Mr. Hatcher had told you that he had been to various establishments that served alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| in addition to seeing the beer in there, such as Cotton Eye Joe on two or three occasions, buying alcohol there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| Mexican restaurants in Maryville, buying alcohol there as well. He told you that, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| He rejected the relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| What's the relevance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| Well, if you can fool a server at one place, you can fool a history of fooling individuals as to his age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4377)|
| 1:13:06| Not relevant, purely speculative, objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Well, if you don't want me to get into details of this and go through all these questions these lawyers people ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| I'm trying to do the summary of it. I'm asking the short questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| The question that you asked was subject to an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| The objection was well taken. It is sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4407)|
| 1:13:48| On the day before this gentleman's car wreck, he called you four times wanting to know about getting together to party with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4428)|
| 1:14:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| He called four times wanting to know what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| Well, on each occasion he asked where you would be partying later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| He wanted to know if everybody was still going to Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4461)|
| 1:14:33| When you got at Michael's, you got there about 12-30, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| 12, 12-30, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| And Mr. Hatcher was already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| You don't know where he had been before there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| You don't know what he had drank or what he had consumed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| You don't know what medication, if any, he was on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| You don't know what kind of illegal drugs he was using, if any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| You don't know what his health habits were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| When you walked in Michael's, he was sitting at a bar with a beverage in front of him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| And you and, or he and Mr. Campbell went back to the dartboard area away from you around 1 o'clock, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4517)|
| 1:15:31| No, me and Mr. Campbell went to the dartboard area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| Okay, and you left Mr. Hatcher wherever you found him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| And then around 1-30 you saw Mr. Hatcher back in the dart area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| Somewhere between 1 and 1-30, I'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| He did not appear to be intoxicated, is what you told the lawyers on your oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| At that point, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| He was not staggering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I never seen him walk, so I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Well, you told the lawyers specifically he wasn't staggering, was not incoherent, did not have slurred speech, did not have any indicia of being intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4570)|
| 1:16:21| No, I didn't see him stagger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| He was sitting in a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| You told the lawyers on your oath that he did not have any appearances or any physical appearances that mimic intoxication, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4586)|
| 1:16:40| I didn't talk to him, so I don't know if he had slurred speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| I didn't see him walk because he was sitting in a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| Now, when you mentioned something here on direct about what you said that he said to the bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4615)|
| 1:17:05| you told the lawyers in your deposition that you were not in a position to confirm that the bartender actually heard these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4625)|
| 1:17:17| That's what you told these lawyers on your oath, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Well, what I told the lawyers on their oath is the bartender was three foot away, I'm four foot away, I heard the comment over music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4639)|
| 1:17:29| Well, the question was put to you and the specific question was put to you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4649)|
| 1:17:41| Let me find it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4661)|
| 1:18:11| You didn't hear him talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| You have no idea just from turning and looking at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| You couldn't tell what the bartender heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4696)|
| 1:18:23| I said, if I can hear it four foot away over music, why can't the bartender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| That's what you testified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| You testified something differently to the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| They asked me the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| I told them the bartender was three foot away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I'm sitting four foot away, music going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| I hear the comment that he's only 20 years old, that he don't turn 21 for another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| That's the answer that I give to the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| If that answer ain't like that on the paper, then somebody's made a type error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| And if you look in the rest of that sheet, you'll also see where I made comments about Christmas parties from 2004 and 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4737)|
| 1:19:08| where I saw underage people being served at Michael's because Last Chance Theater held their parties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4748)|
| 1:19:22| If you want to have a meaningful examination of your testimony, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4762)|
| 1:19:32| Mr. Bell, are you asking a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Mr. Swanson, he's the witness just responding to a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| I don't understand what Mr. Bell's saying to the witness right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| Are you asking him a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| I'm complaining about the late hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Complain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Don't complain to the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| You're right, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Well, except on my rulings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| I was about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4794)|
| 1:20:19| Now, you knew that this young man was not 21 because you were a bouncer at the Last Chance, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4819)|
| 1:20:42| No, I'm the manager of Last Chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| You knew he wasn't 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| And you thought he was buying alcohol at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| Well, you mean I thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| But you thought, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| That's what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Well, you didn't report it to Michael's and say, hey, this guy's underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| Don't sell to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| You didn't say that to Michael's, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| You didn't say that, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| He's a friend of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| He's a friend of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| He's already sitting there drinking one when I walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Michael's don't pay me to come in there and work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| So your attitude basically was, as you told the lawyers, that as far as you're concerned, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4889)|
| 1:21:37| I was already half drunk when I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| That's what you told the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Did you buy Jonathan Hatcher a drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4903)|
| 1:21:54| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| Did you buy you one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| We couldn't hear the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Could you put that on the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Did you buy him one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Did you buy you one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| What was the last time you saw Mr. Hatcher alive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| I'd probably have to say somewhere around 1, 1.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| And did you drive by about and see the debris to where his car had gone off the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4954)|
| 1:22:42| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| What time was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Somewhere around 3.30 a.m. to 4.00 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| And did you call in to the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| No, because I didn't see a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| Did you know that Jonathan Hatcher had purchased beer at the pilot station right before the accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4975)|
| 1:23:03| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| The lawyer showed you a clipboard that was in the maiden exhibit in the deposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| Do you remember the clipboard copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| It had a list of places that Jonathan was going to, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=4995)|
| 1:23:23| It had some names, phone numbers, I think, and maybe addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| One of which was in the vicinity of where this accident did in fact occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5009)|
| 1:23:39| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5020)|
| 1:23:58| May I approach the witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5038)|
| 1:24:11| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I see what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| Is that clipboard that you identified as exhibit 16 in the deposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| It might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Can you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| We didn't hear the question, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| We didn't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| The question I put to you, sir, was this exhibit 16 was the document you identified in your deposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5082)|
| 1:24:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| As Mr. Hatcher's clipboard of his route that he made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| What I told him is I identified the clipboard as one that Last Chance Theater had thrown away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5098)|
| 1:25:11| I have no idea if it actually belonged to Mr. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5111)|
| 1:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5143)|

| 1:26:35| Yes, after he left Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5195)|

| 1:26:39| Don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| I'm going to ask the hearing officer to order this gentleman not to direct comments to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5200)|
| 1:26:55| Referring to the gentleman in the purple shirt, not to direct comments to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| No, he's not talking to his wife, he's talking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| All right, just everybody calm down, it's very late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| We're trying to hold a hearing here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Please do not direct comments that Mr. Bell can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| We're just about done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5238)|

| 1:27:27| Mr. Swanson, I renew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| He said you better get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| I object to this person, whoever he is, making these kind of comments, trying to intimidate counsel for one of the respondents to this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5252)|
| 1:27:42| It's not appropriate to do so, and I ask you to take some administrative action over this proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5262)|
| 1:27:50| Well, we're going to take some administrative action right here when he tells me he doesn't have any more questions for this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| Exactly what I'm going to tell you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| We are adjourned tomorrow until 6 o'clock, and we'll be in touch with regard to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd3?start=5277)|
