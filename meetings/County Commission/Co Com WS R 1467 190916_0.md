| 0:00:39| In just a moment, I'll ask the county clerk's office to call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| But before we call roll, I realize that we may have some folks, this might be your first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=44)|

| 0:01:14| agenda that will then be voted on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| You'll see us discuss some items tonight that we may vote to be approved and they will move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=77)|

| 0:01:41| efficient county commission meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=101)|

| 0:03:11| I'll send that picture to Commissioner Jay so he can share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| The next item on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| I've had a handful of visitors who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| I also have a few folks who have indicated that they'd like to speak about a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| item, item 47, and that's Kevin and Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| And I'd like to, is Kevin and Sherry here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| All right, there you are, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay, what about Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Everybody knows my eyesight's good to about the third row, and then beyond it, it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| a little sketchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Kevin, if you'd like, would you like to wait until we get to that item on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| And if Sherry Raymond is here, she says item 44, but I don't see her here, so we'll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| on her at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| So, next person on the public forum agenda is Ms. Constance Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Ma'am, if you could please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| My name is Constance Everly, E-V-E-R-L-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| My address is 301 North Shore Highway Drive, Knox, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| So, in the last six months, we have had a series of police misconduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| The main concern that the community and myself and many others that are paying attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| to our media outlets is the matter of Philly Phelps and the deaf and the Knox County Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| Department's capability of performing such oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| So, Grayson Fritz is the Knox County Sheriff Officer who was caught by his own church congregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| spreading a hate speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Then you have Bobby Maxwell of the Knoxville Police Department who was caught by his own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| co-worker doing roll call, making inappropriate comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Then you have Brad Hall and Denver Scaff III who were the Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| that got drunk, wrecked a police vehicle, which is a company car, and then participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| in a drunken brawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| That father show, which is our biggest concern, the integrity, honor, the things that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| you do the right thing, trustworthiness, how we had a cover-up by none other than Kimberly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| Glenn, Jerry Glenn, and David Auburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| These are some of the people that I will never forget because I met them at the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| what was it, the East Knoxville Brillerton Branch Club meeting that David runs himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| I'm sorry, Michael Covington runs himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| These are the same people that were there to speak on behalf of Tom Spangler, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| is our sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Yet, they get caught in a cover-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| Now, we're supposed to trust the Knox County Sheriff's Department to oversight the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| in a murder of a Felly Phelps who was shot from the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| The court report has already came out and we saw that he ruled it homicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| Now, we're supposed to trust these same people that have lied under oath for months at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| it said in the news report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| There's no integrity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Then, additionally to the fact, you have Dylan Williams who we have been speaking upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| And if you want to go back, ten days ago, September the 6th, 2019, at the Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| Suites Inn over off of Chapman Highway, we had an arrest warrant supposedly been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| to a supposed suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Shots were fired in that incident too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| He was running and unarmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Is this the concept that we are teaching our police departments, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| That if you can't catch him, shoot him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Gun him down, dead, like a dog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Is this the slavery all over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Slave catching concepts coming back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Foolishness is what we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| That's why we are requesting the oversight of the Department of Justice to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| It is time to bring an external member in to oversight the police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| Both of them, as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Complete misconduct has been represented and shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| As well as the fact, we are fully aware of the cleanup crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| See, there's a cleanup crew that we found out about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| 44 murders by the police department since 2001 to current date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| And it seems like every single time the Knox County Shark Department Investigation Team gets involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| it's the same selection of officers every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| So we're going to request that these officers are not involved in the Philly Phelps murder investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| I.e., Mr. Jerry Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| Man, he a ringleader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| He's in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| How about Michael Washam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Travis Bainfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Tony Willis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Jeff Willis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| We don't want none of them officers involved in this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| They seem to be always in the picture of the police departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| and always find a way to deem them justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Meanwhile, while y'all run around playing cowboy to Indians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| a five-year-old girl was killed this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Can y'all spend the same efforts of playing cops and actually be cops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| and investigate the real terrorists of our communities who are killing our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| A five-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| A gunfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| They're looking at it as a homicide right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| And we don't have a single answer in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| This is unacceptable in all parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| It lets me know that we're probably dealing with some form of corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Because I know for a fact when the Department of Justice gets done sticking the microscope around these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| and find out what's been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| that it's not just going to lead just from the Knox County Police Department or the Sheriff Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| It's going to be some county commissioners, probably some city counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| probably some mayors, may even go all the way up to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| How far does it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Is it going to reach Marshall Blackburn and his capability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| We're going to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Because this is absolutely nothing more than corruption, lies, and lack of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| And keep in mind, 2020 County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| 2020 County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| Okay, next person who had signed up for public forum is Noah Nordstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| Is Noah here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=570)|
| 0:09:41| Hi, Noah Nordstrom, 2116 Woodrush Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| Today I come to you all with a broken heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| For months we've been sounding the alarm about how KPD and the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| have been targeting black and brown, undocumented, low-income, and homeless Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| But despite our best efforts, we have been continually ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| And in fact, the problem has only gotten worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| culminating in the August 26th police killing of Philly Phelps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| We would be remiss if we didn't take a moment to remember who we're fighting for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| So let me do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Philly Phelps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Philly was a father of a five-year-old baby girl who lives here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| Her name is Bella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| He also helped raise two boys that were his girlfriends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| He died when Officer Dylan Williams fired two bullets in his back as he ran away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=638)|
| 0:10:48| Not only has this devastated their family, but it has devastated our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| We are grieved, we are livid, and we are tired of seeing unarmed Knoxvillians harassed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| brutalized, and killed with our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| We're tired of wondering who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| We are tired of fearing for the safety of black, brown, and undocumented communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| and loved ones here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| We are tired of being targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| We saw what happened to David Hayes at a protest here just a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| when he was defending someone against a neo-Nazi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| The cops tackled him to the ground, nearly choked him to death, and charged him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| while letting the neo-Nazis go away scot-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| After I spoke at County Commission a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| a police officer showed up to my house and put his head through my window without knocking on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| So, if one of us are next, we already know that we're not going to receive any justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| And why? Because there was no justice for Philly, there was no justice for Jason Minnick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| and there was no justice for Sierra McCauley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| How can there be justice under a system that's designed to protect cops at all costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| Because of the memorandum of understanding, when KPD commits a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| the Knox County Sheriff's Office is there to cover it up every time, and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| We are here today pleading for justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| We already know what you're going to say, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| It's not my job, you need to speak to somebody else, that's not under my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| But you know what? I'm standing here today in front of the most powerful body in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| The buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| You all control the purse strings of the police department, and there is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| You can refuse to spend another dime on a rogue police department until they clean up their act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| But will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| As much as I want that answer to be yes, I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| Because all of our elected officials, across party lines, have disappointed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| Our Democrat mayor, Rojero, told us to be calm and literally sent condolences to Philly's killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| This Republican-controlled commission has so far done nothing to rein in these killer cops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| and neither has the Republican sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| So I'm asking you all not as partisans, but as people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Will you use your power to bring justice or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| Because if not, we're taking names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| If not, we're taking names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Because on August 6, 2020, Evelyn Gill, Michelle Carringer, Hugh Nystrom, John Shoemaker, Brad Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=817)|
| 0:13:47| Richie Beeler, and Carson Daly, you are on the chopping block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| And if you refuse to demand accountability for our officers, we're going to hold you all accountable ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=833)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Next item on our agenda is where we set the agenda for tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| I'm going to review the items that are proposed to be added, deferred, and the non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| And I've already been approached about adding one additional item onto the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| I also want to say we do have a lot of things that we will be discussing in the discussion part of our meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| It's likely that we may end up carrying over one or more items to next week's meeting if we get a little long on some of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| I know we've got a very detailed presentation on some of the judicial reform aspects of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| So if that goes on, Commissioner Jay has brought us an item around the school move, which we may get a little information on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| Then we may end up moving that to next week, depending on how late we're going tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| But to review, the two items that we need to formally add to the agenda when we vote to set it are items 44 and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=894)|
| 0:15:03| And an item that Commissioner Smith has brought to me is an ordinance around backyard poultry, our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| We have three items that will be deferred, which would be items 31, 32, and 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| And we have these items, which are going to be on the non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| And that's items 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 18, 38, 40, 42, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, and 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=921)|
| 0:15:52| 50, 51, and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| From the Commission, are there any additional changes, adds, any additional items that need to be pulled from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=959)|
| 0:16:07| Okay, seeing none, can I have a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| We have a motion from Commissioner Anders to approve, and it was their second they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| I think the loudest one was over here, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| So we have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| All opposed, please say nay. Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Okay, the ayes have it. The agenda has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| May I have a motion to approve the minutes from last month's meeting, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| I have a motion from Commissioner Carringer and a second, I think I heard, from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| All in favor of approving the minutes, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| All opposed, please say nay. Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Okay, Madam Clerk, I think we're on item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| This is Resolution 101, honoring Knox County Public Defender Mark Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Okay, I'll go ahead. Commissioner Gill, you brought this to us. I'm going to go ahead and call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| This is a very exciting one, but go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, but I would first like to recognize that we do have guests in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| but I want to make sure that we move to full commission with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Okay, Commissioner Gill has made a motion to send this forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| and there's been a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| All in favor of sending this forward with no recommendation, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| All opposed, please say nay. Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| And I'd just like to recognize our guests that are in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| and we are so very honored to recognize our esteemed Mark Stevens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| and they're going to be here to speak briefly to his accomplishments and his legacy in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| Yeah, and I want to second those sentiments from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| We do have one of the most innovative and remarkable public defender offices in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and y'all are welcome to approach the podium and discuss some of Mark's accomplishments in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Yes, because I'd just simply like to yield my time. We have people here who could do it. Thank you, Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you. My name is Eric Glutton. I'm the Deputy District Public Defender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| at the Knox County Public Defender's Community Law Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| so I've had the distinct pleasure of working for Mark Stevens for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| both as an attorney but also a leader in the office, and you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| We have been fortunate enough to have Mr. Stevens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| and he has created what is an incredibly innovative model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| Almost 20 years ago, he had an epiphany as he had gotten a good result at a trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| and he watched a client leaving the courtroom and just thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| I may have helped him at the trial, but I have not helped him better his life at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| He's going to go back out there to the exact same circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| and challenges that he was facing prior to coming in, into the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| and it led Mark to sort of start to think about ways to positively impact individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1124)|

| 0:18:54| He started working on that model, and that's when we changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| to the Knox County Public Defender's Community Law Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| to form community partners and relationships with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| That model is now being recognized nationally as the proper way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| to run a public defender office, and it came from Mark's brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| a large part of it, a lot of the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| If I go to conferences that are outside the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| people know what the Knox County Public Defender's Community Law Office is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| and I think that that's fairly remarkable that you can go to a conference in Atlanta, Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| and the speakers hear where you're from, and they're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| oh my gosh, your office is so amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Will you tell people about what your office does to try and help people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| Mark's office has been recognized locally with awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| statewide with awards, nationally with awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| We just received an award from the American Bar Association last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| for excellent work and innovation in the government office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| They don't even give that award out every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| They've given it 11 times since 1989, so it's a real honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| I'm very excited by this resolution and the fact that hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| the commission will approve naming the building where the public defender's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| currently is housed after Mr. Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I'm going to turn it over to Ms. Laura Chambers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| who's his longtime assistant and director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| so that she can add some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| And we're so glad that you're here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| I think we're very fortunate in Knox County that we've had Mark Stevens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| as the only elected public defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| He was first elected in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| He's done an outstanding job for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| We have received local, state, and national recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| for the programs he's implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| And as an office, we certainly would respect and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| that you would consider naming the building after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| And I think we need to make sure the naming of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| is going to be internal in the main lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Is that correct, Miss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| And I just need to say this is probably a small secret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| that we still need to keep until October the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| because he really doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| So, with approval, I admit it's a little too late now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| but with approval of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| we're recognizing the legacy of Mark Stevens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| and the work that he's contributed to building a better Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Commissioner Gilpin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| any other commissioners would like to sign up as co-sponsors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| I know I'll be the first to volunteer to be a co-sponsor with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| I think it's going to be the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Okay. All right. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| We've got a proper motion to send that forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| with no recommendation, so we can vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| All in favor of sending this forward, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1302)|

| 0:24:13| In looking over what the Merit Council stands for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| and what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I feel you must have a person who is going to be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| who is going to be unbiased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| who is going to take the information given to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| and make the best possible informed decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| And to me, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| you have to have high regard for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Knox County law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| because you wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| that the policies and the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| that have been set in place are being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1483)|

| 0:24:49| that there are fair promotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1489)|

| 0:24:56| And in saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| as a current director of a nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| working with students in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| I have to display those characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I must be fair to each one of my students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| to their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| I must be open-minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I must be unbiased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| When speaking with their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| about issues, about their homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| or whatever is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I must be a good listener,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1523)|

| 0:25:27| and make a sound decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1527)|

| 0:25:53| in what is really needed to have happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1553)|

| 0:27:33| And honestly, the first somebody suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| that I apply for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| and my first reaction was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| But then thought about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| read the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1665)|

| 0:27:49| read the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| thought about my history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| which I've owned a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1673)|

| 0:28:02| dealing with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| and thought I have the skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| that this council is looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| to look at the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1689)|

| 0:28:17| that benefits the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1697)|

| 0:28:41| or served on any other boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| or been involved with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| in any capacity as a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1725)|

| 0:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Next, it's Dr. Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Todd Peters, 5206 Green Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| When I looked at the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| for the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| I felt like they aligned very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| with what I currently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I'm the Chief Medical Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| at the Military Entrance Processing Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| so as a CMO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I have to identify applicants in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| that are going to be successful in the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I manage the medical department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| so I'm dealing with government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| and I'm involved in hiring, training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| evaluating, rewarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| and potentially counseling government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| within the constraints of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| So that's pretty much all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| I'm very concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Do you have any relatives that work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| or have you been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| with the Sheriff's Office in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Involved with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I mean, have you served on any boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| or what has been your involvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Like Merit Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| I have a second or third cousin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| that's on the Merit Council, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| What are the boards that you serve on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| What's your community activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| your service to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| I'll be frank with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Up until about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| I was in private practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| and I spent 70 hours plus or minus a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| and I did not voluntarily spend time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| more time away from my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| So it's more of a recent thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| I'm beginning to look for opportunities to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| now that I have a set schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| and more time and my kids are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Any additional questions from any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1856)|

| 0:31:07| Can we not? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1871)|

| 0:31:49| Do we do nominations and the voting next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Actually, what we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| if we did a vote and selected a candidate tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| it could be sent forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| if we wanted to be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| If we wanted to send it forward and actually did a vote next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| or we could do the vote next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Well, part of the nomination is the voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| and then you end up with the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I would feel better if we deferred it until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| All right. Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| And we will take the vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| All right. Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Yes. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| In fairness to all the nominees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I think you should let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| if you're requiring them to be here next week or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| I don't think they need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| I don't think they need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| But all of them have provided us with a resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| that's got an email and phone numbers on the resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| So if any of you all have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| that you'd like to follow up directly with the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| please do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Otherwise, we'll move the actual vote forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| and we'll follow our process where we go around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| get the nominations on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| and then end up selecting with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| So, thank you. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1973)|

| 0:33:01| for no recommendation with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| I think that was Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=1983)|

| 0:36:06| to participate in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| and SSEP Mission 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| to the International Space Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| at a cost of $23,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Mr. Reiswick, I pulled this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and my simple question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| does this mean one of our science experiments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| is going to the space station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| If you could elaborate on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| I thought it was pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| We've been fortunate for the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| that we have students who compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| for that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| to be able to have their experiment go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| on the International Space Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| And so, typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| we have between 20 and 25 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| who will have teams that work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| And it's anywhere grades 5 through grades 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| for teams to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| So there are certain parameters placed on the experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| The stuff to package that is sent to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Then they all submit their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| We have a panel that goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| and picks the winner for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| And then they get to actually go to Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| to watch their flight take off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| and take the experiment to space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| So it's quite a life-changing experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| for lots of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| And I don't know that we've had the same one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| win any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| So we've seen it from across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| pretty much be able to have that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| So we've had kids from schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| all over the county participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I believe Carter's had some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I think Carter may have been one last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| I have to remember and look back at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| And I think that opportunity to be able to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| and actually see it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| to see that kind of launch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| and know they had a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| And then they actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| when the experiment comes back down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| once it's all cleared and safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| they send the results and those things back to the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| to see how it actually performed in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| So it's quite a good experience for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| That's pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Do I have a motion for approval on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Is there any extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| I would say I can get that information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| If I try to explain it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| I'll probably really mess it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| I just wanted to know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Okay. Motion for approval on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| All right. Motion to approve from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Motion to approve the Nott Sunny Contract Number 18-071| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| with Helen Ross McNabb Center Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| for the provision of mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| and treatment management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Okay. Mr. Ross, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| I was the one who actually pulled that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I noticed when I read through the details on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| it talked about the amount per school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| but it wasn't clear if that was applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| towards all of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| or if that was just a few schools in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| If you could just briefly elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| So this was something last year we kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| there was a huge need for that behavioral therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| counseling for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| So last year we tried to model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| to try to have that at all of our secondary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| our middle schools, as well as our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| There was kind of a, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| it was kind of a pilot to see what cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| would work for both organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| And what we saw by the end of the year last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| that the funds were probably a little insufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| for the services provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| by the time they got to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| So we've kind of gone back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| and are looking at that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| So where we are in agreement with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| is that we will pay that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| $23,000 per school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| to provide a Helen Ross counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| at all of our middle and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So the same amount of service there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| The only difference being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| as that caseload builds up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| some of those counselors may serve more than one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| but we'll still pay that overall cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| for one per school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| And when that caseload builds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| then they could actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| more than one counselor at every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| depending on where that caseload goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| So that's what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| for Helen Ross as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| as gives us the service that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| All right. Thank you, Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Mr. Schoonmaker has a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Yeah, well, just kind of a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| on your question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| So the total cost is $1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| three-quarters of a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| a million and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| $800,000. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And we do that through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| fund that through a couple of different grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| granted dollars to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| So that's the total cost for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Okay. Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| or which of you two had your lights on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| All right. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| What are some of the broad mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| we're tracking and looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| to help address some of the concerns students have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Great question, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| You know, this, as a school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| we're kind of in a place where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| this is not one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| that a lot of our teacher prep programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| deal with at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| You know, a lot of school counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| has dealt with kind of more minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| I would say, kind of social-emotional issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| maybe breakup with a boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| not that that's always minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| breakup with a boyfriend or girlfriend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| those sorts of situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| and academic counseling and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So this is something that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| kind of come on deeper-rooted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| things that probably in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| five to ten years at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| And so we really don't have positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| that deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| We talk around things like ACEs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| the adverse early childhood experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| that students have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Sometimes those manifest themselves different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| You know, we've seen a national trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| increase in things like suicide, depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| and those sorts of things that are there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| So it's kind of a combination of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| that you deal individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| with students who show some behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| that may be apathy in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| it may be that they come to a counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| seeking help, it may be friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| refer those sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| and then how do we dig to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| that's kind of personalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| for each one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| who may be expressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Do we know how many students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| engaged these counselors last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I don't have, thank you, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| I don't have an exact number with me on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| We could probably get that for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| There's a caseload for each counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| and I think I know what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| I think it's about 1 to 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| maybe 1 to 25 that they can serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and then if the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| goes over that load,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| then Helen Ross provides additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| counselors or therapists for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Do you know how many schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| you had that went over that load?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| I would have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| We could get that number for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Yeah, last two questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| that Commissioner Smith asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| are the 23,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| that you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| is that the total salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| for this counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| No, ma'am, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| It's a much reduced rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| and what Helen Ross McNabb does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| is they're able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| with insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| offset the cost of some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| so it's a greatly disaccounted price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I'm going to quote them a ballparking number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| it's 68-some-thousand dollars per counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| if you look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| so it's greatly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Okay, well, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| okay, and then also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| are some of the schools sharing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Like, would one be half-day somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I mean, that's not a full-time counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| at all of our schools, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| The plan in order to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| the economics work a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| was that that would be initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| until caseloads are built up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| so two schools may share one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| but as the caseload builds in one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| enough to be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| a full-time counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| so last year we had about 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| We had one per school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| This year we're beginning with 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| with the option to continue to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| as the caseloads grow for each counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Well, it's definitely something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| that I know our schools need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| in this day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| and our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| that takes more time away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| and like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| they've not been trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| to deal with these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| that our teachers and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| of those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| that Commissioner Smith asked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| that would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I believe your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| told us a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| that Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| employs somewhere in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| of 34 to 36 psychiatrists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| on your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| for all Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Will they be interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| or is this something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| that your people on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| that they don't even deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| with these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| So different roles kind of in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Our psychologists, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| that maybe you're referring to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| typically they do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| They do work with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| They work a lot with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| individual education plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| and recertifications for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| and communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| between all those parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| as we put different layers into schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| be it the school counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| be it the counselor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Some students have been receiving services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| maybe through Helen Ross outside of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| and then they receive them now within school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| So they wouldn't cross over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| on their sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| or their treatment for the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| It's pretty clearly defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| between those who does what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| And I might add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| I've worked a little bit in social work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I think that this Helen Ross contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| is going to be more case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| versus, say, just having the pure clinicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| that are doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| and they can work and complement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| each other's services very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| especially with the case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| making sure that the client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| is sort of following the physician's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| or the psychologist's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| helping plug them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| and making sure the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| are providing a home environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| that supports that clinical assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| When students do receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| outside services from Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| will that be factored into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| or is just a separate metric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And is it constant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| This is a broad question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Is it concentrated in particular schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| or is it just countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| in terms of some of the social,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| emotional, mental components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| that we're trying to layer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| to help students with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Good questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| I'm not 100% positive, Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| on the percentage who may already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| be receiving services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| who are receiving them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| or if it's all brand-new students to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| I think some do have a prior relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| with Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| because I know initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| when there was discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| about whether we could work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| this contract out or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| there was some talk that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| some of these students already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| received services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| but there were concentrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| of social, emotional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| I would say we could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| at the stats of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| but it doesn't appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| that they're around socioeconomic lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| or geographic lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| We're seeing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| in pretty much all of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| behaviors that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| our educators were not trained to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| We're doing a lot of trainings for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| to have them work on those gateway trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| and recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| and how to de-escalate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| from the south side to east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| We've talked it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| but I do need a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| to send it forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| We already have a motion for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Is there a second from Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Item number 38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Resolution 701,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| is expressed in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| of the Public Building Authority's efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| to apply on behalf of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| for a 2019 TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| multimodal access grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| for the Hollis Greenway Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| with a grant amount up to $1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| including a Knox County match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| of up to $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| and future maintenance responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, Mr. Danilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I actually pulled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I know we're seeing some very active work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| getting feedback from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| on our greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| but as you probably saw in the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| just had some basic questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| if you think we got a good shot at this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| and how, if this is funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| kind of how that would sort of fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| into our big picture on our greenway plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| So this is actually Parks and Rec's role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| in this is to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| We do Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| complete if it is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| If we do get the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| then we'll take over the maintenance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| That's where our role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| That's why I'm up here today for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| And is this going to be part of one of our greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Is that kind of the connection with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I believe, Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| you're one of the folks working on this, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Justin, you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| It's going to connect Clayton Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| You want to do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| than I can probably describing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| but yeah, it will be part of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Kristen Grove, 2502 North Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| I'm Director of Property Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| for the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And as Mike mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| we are submitting for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| on behalf of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| and of Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| In terms of do we have a good chance at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| we did the intent to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| and were awarded the ability to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| So that's the phase that we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| We're able to turn in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| That is due October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| They will not announce those awards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| until the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| so we're assuming January or February of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| before we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| At that point, we will assess the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| If any funds are awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| we will assess how to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| The plans are currently developed in multi-phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| There's about four phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| that would complete the total connections through halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| And if all is awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| we'll work with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| on a little bit of additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| that would be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| But we can proceed either as a phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| or multiple phases or the total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| And you referenced Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Commissioner Biggs, would you like to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| I believe this is a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| if we can get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| It'll be the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| that Knox County's got it in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| So I'm looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| It's a great opportunity to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And it would definitely benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| from all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| at the line of the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| And honestly, I believe it'll drive traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| into Knox County from the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| It'll be very beneficial all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| All right, sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Okay, I need a motion for approval, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3092)|

| 0:51:38| with a second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3098)|

| 0:52:18| We've got the second and the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| So we have a motion to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Your motion, Brad, it came up so quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Was that to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Mine was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| His was to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| So you're operating on his right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| All right, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3152)|

| 0:52:36| So now on the floor we have a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| So Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| do you want to ask your questions right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| or do we want to have a first step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Is there a second to your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3167)|

| 0:52:51| And then procedurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| is it better that we vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| at a voting meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| as opposed to a work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Well, it's a budgetary issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| It would be better for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| but you have to vote on your motion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Okay, so do we want to do the motion first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| and then I'll ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Sure, the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| is a substitute motion to send forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3195)|

| 0:53:30| You don't have anything on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| What are you going to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| You just took it off the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| We can always pull it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| if you want to pull it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| All it takes is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Correct me, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I'll get it resolved with finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3224)|

| 0:53:54| No, it's not going to be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| It's been sent forward without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| so it will be voted on separately next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3238)|

| 0:54:41| that the body understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3281)|

| 0:54:45| inside the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| and not exterior to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| It is part of the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| And they've already looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| working with Fast Signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| to have their design appropriately modeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3295)|

| 0:55:00| that were made earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3300)|

| 0:55:04| the original architect of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| is the one that is going to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| with the lettering and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| So it complements the entire process for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| So I just want to make sure that's added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3314)|

| 0:55:27| I'd like to add my name to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3327)|

| 0:55:47| for next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3347)|

| 0:57:26| This is our first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I'm going to make a motion to send 45 and 46| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| without recommendation due to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| that they have to be voted on by two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Okay, the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| is to send both items, 45 and 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Okay, we have a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Okay, are we going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Chief Frazier's here next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| So we'll have questions about how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| to see how that will be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Item number 47,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| Ordinance 102 is amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| the Knox County Code Appendix A Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Article 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| by adding a new section 6.80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| to create a planned development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Ordinance O-90-130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| All right, this is another ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| so it would need to probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| the proper motion would be to send forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| However, I do know that we've had two folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| who've asked to speak about it at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| so I'd like to give them a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| to speak to this first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| and that was Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| You're actually the first one to sign up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| so thank you for your patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| in getting to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| So, Mr. Murphy, if you could please step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| 108 Murphy Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| And Mr. Chairman, one point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| this is, there's a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| that was announced for 6 p.m. tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| Is this that public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| This is not that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| I know whenever there's an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| we do have to have a public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| and send out a public notification to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| and that will be coming after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| But as it's on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| and you've signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| you can speak to both of them if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| and it might be more efficient of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| to speak right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| All right, I'm here on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Earlier today, I followed up with some e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| that Ken Frazier had sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| We are, we're generally in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| of the idea of the Planning Development District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| It's got, it's a good tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| that it gives the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| and yourselves some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| to do some better development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| But we're also very wary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| This tool allows for some pretty broad waivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| of use and height and setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| And we're a little bit wary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| that with that large amount of latitude that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| there's not a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| there's not quite as much as control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| as we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| And, you know, we're actually seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| this already manifest itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| I'm not going to talk in abstract terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| but we're already seeing it manifest itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| One thing that we wanted to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| you know, the plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| it requires a preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| to be approved by Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| and then County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| That's the current zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| It talks about an optional concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| that would happen before that preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| that would go in front of Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| We'd really like that to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| to take the word optional out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| That concept plan should really be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| The reason this is important is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| because that's where the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| first come in front of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| present their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| and that's where the community has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| this real first chance to have impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| and get it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| If you don't have that concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| being a required item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| then an applicant comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| they've got full head of steam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| they think they've had all their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| to clear this through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| they come to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| and then they talk to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| for the very first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| well, can you talk with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| We think the concept plan is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| The South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| and the Ancient Lore development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| that's a village that's been proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| they've already applied for plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| and they've already got a preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| on the Planning Commission agenda for October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| So this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| they haven't had a lot of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| yet with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and this is an example where they've really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| if they'd been required to do a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| as part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| that would be a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| for them to talk to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| So we think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| There's a couple of other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| that I would urge you to look at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| 6.80.04.B talks about the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| or things that we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| in terms of some exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| for district regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| and we really think that those six things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| that are called out under 6.80.04.B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| it should really be all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| not any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| So there's a wording change we've suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| A little bit farther down under 6.80.04.C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| C.2, which calls out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| that a design characteristic and amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| might be improvement of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| on-site and off-site infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| I encourage you to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| honestly, to strike that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| I think that will make your deliberations more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| If the applicant says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| well, I'm going to add a turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| and that's the amenity that I should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| that I'm giving you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| and that way I want to be weighed from all this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| and I want to be weighed from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I want to be able to build my buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| closer together and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| that's really pretty small to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| well, you're improving an existing road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| by adding a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| So I think if you strike that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| you'll focus on the other amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| the other one through six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| that are actually really good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Let's see, a final one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I didn't have this in the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| but 6.80.01.F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| land development that to the greatest extent possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| preserves natural vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Maybe instead of encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| you can strengthen that and call that require land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| that to the greatest extent possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| preserves natural vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| That's a really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| that could add a little bit more teeth in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| But anyways, changes that we have requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| we think are good to add a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| interaction between the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| and the community before it starts this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| which gives them a lot of latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| We think that's useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| And we think that there's a little bit of strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| that could happen around the benefits and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| And that will make your deliberations easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| and that'll make it easier for planning staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| So I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| I think we, was Sherry here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| She had indicated that she'd make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| If I should have been here sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| I was under the impression there was a workshop first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| and then the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| My remarks are fairly general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| but they are pertaining to a specific development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| It has to do with the Knox County South Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| and the Planning Commission's planned development addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| the amendment that they're trying to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| to allow more flexibility for the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Sevierville Road, and they're getting ready to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Sevierville Road is a state-designated scenic parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| That's the little road that runs sort of parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| In general, the zoning out there is rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| which includes retail and service-oriented goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| and services that meet day-to-day and agricultural needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| not just the general shops that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| people go to in Turkey Creek and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| There's a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| which is not supposed to be within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| a half mile of existing commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| which I think some of it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Then there's two designations for CC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| and I forgot what, I didn't write down what that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| but it's at the intersection of arterial streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| The main requirement for that is it to be relatively flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| and have vehicle and pedestrian connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| That is not possible on Nixon at Sevierville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| Anything in that area is not going to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| Regional commercial also requires flat sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| This one doesn't even come close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| We're talking about a 10% allowable slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| versus a 30 to 60% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| which is what the site actually has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| General commercial says that such land-use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| and related zoning should not be extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| because of adverse effects on traffic, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| and environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| And there's several others that all require flat terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| So I also was looking at the south sector maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| from page, on page 9 out of 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| It appears that there's no wastewater service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| already in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| but there are locally important soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| On page 13, it shows watersheds and impaired streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| They've either been rated not supporting or not assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| I think that needs to be looked at seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| before anything proceeds any further out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| On page 3 of the city sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| it has some of the largest park and recreational resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| in Knox County, including IM's Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| Meade's Quarry, the State Wildlife Management Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| William Hastie Park, and Fort Dickerson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| And one goal in future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| is to establish an unbroken connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| in the area's recreational, environmental, educational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| and historic assets along the Tennessee River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| called the Urban Wilderness Historic Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| ALV does not fall into any of those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| I don't really know why we would want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| a Pigeon Forge-style attraction in such a poor location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| Also, the South City Corridor just released their TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| It apparently does not take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| the projected traffic increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| caused by allowing ALV to be completely developed and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| The resort will benefit very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| In reality, I seriously doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| there's going to be that many jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| and whether they'll even be local people hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| is another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| And, of course, there's a downside to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| The increased transience, crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| strain on our infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| introduction of non-native species and bugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| potential exposure of citizens to measles, flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| many other types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| It just isn't worth allowing the encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| of the type of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| that might briefly make money for a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| and then go under and be a burden on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Just as a brief summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| once again, this is an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| that came to us on its second reading for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| It actually first came to us last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| and went through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Some of the changes that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| that have recently been suggested by the Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I'm just saying it would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| a little bit more helpful to have gotten it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| before the reading last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| But as tonight is not the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| that this is actually going to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| that actually happens at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| But if there's any, I guess, energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| You're about to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| I was just going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| to send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I'll recognize that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| but I also want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| if anyone wants to take a hard look at this next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| that would probably be the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| if someone wanted to suggest a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| But we have a motion from Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| Is there a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| All in favor of this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Sorry, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| All right, Commissioner Daly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Age before beauty, I guess, in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| if we do a lot of changing of this draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| we have to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| And then, Mr. Murphy, can you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Kevin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| All right, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Okay, will you send us a revision with red, what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| So we can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Certainly, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Are you good, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Okay, all right, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I'd like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| You have a very confused look on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| It's bad eyesight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I didn't know if you had other things to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| In further clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| if any changes are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| those amendments need to be introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| and voted on next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| as part of the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| If any changes are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| then it would result in a change to the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| and then that would result in it being...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| the clock being reset to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| But any of those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| or changes to the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| would happen during the voting process next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| If anything was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| then it would go back to first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Would a vote be approved next week with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| to restate Commissioner Jay's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| was if it's debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| and if there are changes made at next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| after the changes, if they were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| would a vote next week post-changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| count as the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| or would that send it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| for the next month to be the first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| It would count as first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| What I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| So next month would be the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| And I appreciate you saying I look a little confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Well, I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| You look like you had more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I didn't want to jump in before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Were we supposed to get an e-mail today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| of those changes that you all were thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Because I'm looking over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| and I didn't receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| I received an e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| I believe, from Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I think it was on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| I sent one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| I think it was commissioners at knoxcounty.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| which I sent it to this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Okay, so it may not have been forwarded just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| I'm not sure how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| It should be commission at knoxcounty.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| not commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I'll double-check that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| and then my apologies if I messed that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| So you'll send that to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| because I didn't receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| I'll send that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| Yes, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I think that's a good recommendation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| I do see planning commission staff back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| If you could please come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| and answer Commissioner Smith's question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| Amy Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Yes, it came through the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| as a recommendation to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| did you present these ideals to the MPC commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| I believe most of these have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| They're actually, if you look in the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| the packet document that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| you'll have a very long email from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| that has a lot of these statements in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| So they've considered things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| the optional versus required concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| I know that's been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| But you did stand before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| and ask for these same changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Does that clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| The motion on the floor is to send this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| This will be subject to a roll call vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4394)|

| 1:13:29| My friend across the aisle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| you may want to look on page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4411)|

| 1:13:43| I believe, to read a particular page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4423)|

| 1:13:53| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Item number 50, presentation of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Judicial Assessment Draft by Property Development Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Kristin Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| It was, yeah, it said after for the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Frankly, I see we've got our presenters here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| but I want to also be really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| This is something that's been a long time coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| and I want to thank the committee and the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| who has put so much work into this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| I know that some of the studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| that have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| by the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| and the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| have been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I know that some of this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| is not the kind of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| that we want to see just become a binder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| that sits on a wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| but many of these things that I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Jesse called me over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| and he asked me a few questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| and I said, well, Jesse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| it's my opinion that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| wants to complete actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| on these types of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| as opposed to just letting this be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| like when you go to a training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| So, y'all have got a big presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| to give to us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Please keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| you're not just presenting to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| but you're presenting these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| and this information to the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| via the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| that you're sharing with our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| So, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| it sounds like you're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| a lead-off matter on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I'm a lead-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| I appreciate you taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| to listen to this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| I appreciate how this came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| So, Mayor Jacobs, early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| and his administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| put together a jail task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| which comprised a few elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| and in that task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| we asked PBA to use Barbara McMurray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| who actually did the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| of our original jail pods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| back in the 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| and they have a lot of history with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| that is really interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| as far as some of their documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| So, who we have here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| is Mike Dooley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| from Barbara McMurray Architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| and they helped us find justice planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| and you'll hear today from Alan Richardson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| who is one of the founders of Justice Planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| and has done work all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| and also was part of our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| was Jim Hart from CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| and so we had a wide range of brain trust there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| to go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| and so I would just like to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| that what we're going to present today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| is an executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| It's not the total report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| and we do have the entire slide presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| if we need to go that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| but we want to be diligent of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Feel free to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| and I'm assuming the first one to go will be Alan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| so very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| My name is Alan Richardson with Justice Planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| I want to thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| to take this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| and to present this executive overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| of our draft report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| And, Alan, if you could take really just 30 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| just to tell us a little bit about Justice Planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| who you all are, and what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| I started Justice Planners a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I'm a former corrections officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| and jail administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| in the state of South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| I've got more than 10 years' experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| in local corrections and operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| I've been on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| with the National Institute of Corrections in Colorado| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| and have been doing private consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| really for the last between 15 and 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| To begin, the primary goals of our study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| were to identify opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| to recommend practical and quantifiable strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| to help reduce the average length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| of the inmate population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| while maintaining the public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| and the integrity of the judicial process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| and to develop an inmate population projection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| The first section I'm going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| is the historical data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| that we have collected and analyzed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| The general population of Knox County is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| It has increased over 22 percent since 2000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| and is projected to increase another 16.7 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| between now and the year 2044.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| The current 2019 average daily population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| of the Knox County Detention Facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| is up over 30 percent, 30.3 percent actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| compared to just four years ago in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| At a basic level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| there's two primary factors that determine jail population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| That's the number of bookings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| how many people are actually brought into the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| and how long they stay on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| Now, the number of bookings in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| are actually down slightly from four years ago in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| It's a 0.7 percent decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| in the number of people that have been going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| However, this year in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| the average length of stay is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| just over 30 percent higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| than it was four years ago in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| And so, the increase in the average length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| has outpaced the decline in bookings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| which has resulted in a higher inmate population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| So, in other words, fewer people are coming to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| but the jail population is still continuing to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| In the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| the average length of time for just the pretrial population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| has grown from 8.6 days five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| to 13.8 days currently in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| And these are inmates that have not been sentenced yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| They're awaiting to go to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Now, in Knox County, there are several factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| that contribute to the jail population increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| in the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| and that is the criminal justice case processing times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| inmates awaiting transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| to the Tennessee Department of Corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| and the inmate population is shifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| to a more serious type of charge or offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| Now, the case processing time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| is the time between arraignment and the disposition of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| for those in our data set for the inmate population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| The case processing time in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| has risen on average 45 percent for all cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| in the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| and that pretty much mirrors the felony population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| as well as the misdemeanor population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| and that pretty much mirrors the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| in the average length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| over that same period of time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| The number of inmates awaiting a transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| to the Tennessee Department of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| has more than doubled since 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Actually, it's increased almost fourfold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| from just over 50 four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| to just over 200 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| So that's our historical information look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| Then we put together a population forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| for the next 25 years for the inmate population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| Now, the forecasts are built with the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| that there's going to be no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| to public practice, to laws, statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| In other words, everything continues to progress tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| the same way that it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Looking at the next 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| with all things remaining unchanged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| moving in the same direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| we're looking at the population growing substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| By 2043, by this projection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| the average daily population could more than double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| to more than 3,500 inmates on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| And that's the statistical picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| of what could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| if certain assumptions play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| We think there's going to be a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| of changes in policy and practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| that will intervene and hopefully help curb that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| But the key to avoiding that massive increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| in the inmate population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| is going to be bringing down the average length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Now, we did an alternative forecast as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| using the same context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| the same pretense that everything remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| The only difference is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| if the average length of stay was rolled back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| four years to the 2015 levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| there would still be a projected increase in population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| but only by about 300 beds or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| Reducing the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| through some enhanced forms of diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| would help reduce the population as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| From our sample population from the spring of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| we looked at possibly diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| of those incarcerated for misdemeanors or writs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| or traffic or public order felonies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| and there was 83 inmates in that data set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| that could have possibly been diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| That's approximately the size of two housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| in the current detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| So, our population reduction recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| The Criminal Justice Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| should be reinstated and returned to regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Establish a Correctional Population Management Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| of the CJC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Use ad hoc committees to target and solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| specific issues that impact the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| And to build and expand the committee member knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| about the criminal justice system data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| as well as those items and issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| that impact the jail directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| A second recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| is to expand the use of pre-trial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| This program is still pretty young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| The magistrates just began ordering it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| I believe, in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| We'd recommend to expand and improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| the risk assessment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Currently, the criminal history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| of the defendants in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| is only looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| We would recommend expanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| to the full criminal history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| and to automate this risk assessment model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| and instrument as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| Another recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| is to move the probation department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| under the oversight of the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| which is currently under the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| And to study the impact of the probation department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| and the impact of moving pre-trial release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| under the courts as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| not under the office of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| I mentioned the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| jail population manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| You could use existing resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| to carry out the function of a jail population manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| That's basically to monitor and track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| the cases of the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| to determine who might be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| to plead guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| to be brought before the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| in a convenient or expeditious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| the Tennessee Department of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| to consider utilizing a legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| to develop a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| to get the Department of Corrections inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| moved out of the jail much faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| and into the state responsibility and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| One more recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| is to establish afternoon court dockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| in general sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| to dedicate a jail docket as needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| in general sessions and in circuit courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| To utilize technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| to shift the day lines for daily arraignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Currently, if an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| is booked in after midnight on a Thursday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| they have to wait until Monday morning for arraignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Some information, IT recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| is to replace the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| information management system in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| with a more current, up-to-date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| robust system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| that could generate statistical snapshots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| on a daily basis for key stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| so everybody is much more informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| on who is sitting in the jail and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And we would also recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| that the probation department be incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| into that system as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| so they don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| basically decipher printed reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| to find out who is eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| Some quick win recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| from these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| again, hold regular CJC meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Establish a jail population management committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| Allow pre-trial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| to revisit cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| of individuals that are still sitting in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| Increase and improve daily automated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| reporting to the key stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| And to ask the Department of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| for assistance in setting a cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| on the number of individuals awaiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| transfer to DOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| That's kind of our quick win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| list of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Kind of a master planning recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| to happen either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| is to consider building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| a downtown booking center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| that would serve as a processing center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| for all new arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| rather than currently making the trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| out to the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| which is a 24 mile round trip from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| In addition to the booking center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| there should be intake housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| for those that might be able to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| typically you're going to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| within the first 72 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| if an individual is going to be able to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| So if they're booked downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| if they're held there for a maximum of 72 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| then if they can postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| they're released from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| If not, then they're transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| out to the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| It's going to save a lot of round trip processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| both for initial arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| as well as bringing folks back in for court as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| So it's going to be a high churn area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| We're estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| that would require about 200 beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| for intake housing initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| we would recommend including space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| for community service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| to be located at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| And this is off of a recent comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| from Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| which we wholeheartedly concur with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| To be able to get the resources there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| to be able to address the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| of these individuals there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| to hopefully get them attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| and connected with some local resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| so they're not coming back and reoffending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| quite as many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| We think the downtown booking center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| will benefit both short and long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| If the average length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| is not able to be reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| then this may be a first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| of a long-term planning process for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| If it is able to be brought down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| then these 200 beds alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| would help to cover the vast majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| of the expansion needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| or the increase in population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| by being able to bring that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| So I guess the big decision to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| or to be worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| would be how to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| the average length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| in getting that reduced in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| But we do think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| either way, a booking center downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| and associated intake housing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| would be a good first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| no matter what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| I'm sure we're going to have some questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I recognize both Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| and Commissioner Jay's light came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| I'm not sure who came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| All right. Commissioner Biggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| Commissioner Jay wants to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| since he was on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| All right. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| I have the pleasure of serving on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| There's a lot of hard work that's gone in today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| just to sort of the tip of the iceberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| of the hard work yet to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| So I appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| A couple quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Ten years ago, we had a similar study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| that Knox County paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| And I don't believe your firm conducted that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| But I do know, as part of your due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| one of the very first things we said was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| make sure you read the study from ten years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| to make sure we don't repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| the same actions or inactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Were you able to review that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| And are there any sort of significant bullet points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| that you're seeing again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| that if we had done ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| we might not be in this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Good question. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| We did review the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| There were some valid recommendations in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| we feel, that are still valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| and included in the report that we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| So far as repeating actions or inactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| we would just recommend that you take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Another quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| In the breakdown of the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| one thing that I didn't see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| who is the decision maker of said action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Who has the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| governing body that makes decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| You have several recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| but who's responsible for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| or who has the power to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| Did you sort of go through that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| or establish a pre-trials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| or move to probation court, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Who can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| With each of those action items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| did you identify who has the responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| No, we did not lay that out specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| That is something that we could go back and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Is that something you could do in a short amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| to help us think about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Because by coming forward to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| there's only so much we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| And there's things that fall under the purview of the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| under the DA, our court systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| I think it would be really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| to determine who has the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| to put the pieces of the puzzle together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| I'm confident that probably all of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| are represented on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| but it would help us get a little bit of roadmap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| if you could provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| If I might weigh in on what Commissioner Jay has asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| I guess one interesting discovery on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| would be how much is tied to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| and who's been given what power to do what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| And if push came to shove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| if we need to modify the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| to force change to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| I'd be curious to see how much is management decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| and how much of the setup and your recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| is determined by our organizational structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| which is determined by our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Can I add one more quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| From reading the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| and sort of analyzing the big picture here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| you said it at the beginning of your presentation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| that the amount of people in jail is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| Essentially, crime is down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| but inmate population is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| And there's lots of statistics and data in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| Did you, through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| analyze the court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| and the understanding of why it's taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| almost double the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| in the last four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| to process people through the court systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| the schedules of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| I mean, you touched on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| but is that a whole other study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| or were you able to glean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| sort of why it's taking so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| for people to get through our court systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| Everything seems to grind to a halt in that world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| An additional in-depth study of the court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| would give a lot more specific details for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| One thing that we did see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| and as part of our recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| is to establish an afternoon docket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| to establish some jail-specific dockets to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| And it doesn't have to be a daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| or even a weekly occurrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| but to have some occasional dockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| that are focused on the inmate population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| that will just take a look at those jail inmate cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| at a particular time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| to help get a larger number of cases processed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| Not to say to give any special treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| for those cases by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| but just to get them before the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| and to get the cases disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| One thing that we did see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| and that we point out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| the increase in the time to disposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| is mirroring the increase in the average length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| And so there does appear to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| a pretty direct one-to-one correlation between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Meaning if people could get through the system faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| we would not have as many people staying in our beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| therefore we would not have their population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| And who is the authority and the body over our court systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| Is it each individual judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| or is there a state governing body that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| A lot of jurisdictions are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| That may be part of my first question is who assigns what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Okay, I'll let that one be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Thank you for your time. I appreciate your effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| That was why I asked if some of this is charter determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Okay, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I appreciate the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| I feel like this is a very broad stroke, I guess you could say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I'd like some dollar amounts on some of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| if you could get those over to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| As well as, I think it was seven or eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| we double-bunked the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| I don't know if that's going to be on your tenure purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| that you saw in the previous slide show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| that you guys may have taken a gander at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| But, so basically what you're saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| like Commissioner Jays said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| it's kind of coming to a halt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| whenever you get to the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| But what I would like to see some things about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| is the pretrial release program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| as well as the number of misdemeanors that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| And if we have people that are committing misdemeanors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| and just sitting in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| what is that to people that are committing felonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Just for me, I mean you could probably email me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| if you wanted to in my commission email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| so I could see those dollar amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| so I could look at it just from my own perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Who are our inmates and what impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Because you indicated that there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| the length of stay at 34 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Who are those inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Who are those inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| What crimes are they committed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| What is the profile of our inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Because I looked at the inmate list that had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| I mean at violent crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Are we saying the inmates at that profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| are the ones at 34 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| I can't say specifically by criminal offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| that those are the ones at 34 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| The top three categories for the charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| for the inmate population are drug offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| Right. And there is where I'm headed right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| Burglary and theft and violent offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| So those, the ones that are at the very top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| of that inmate profile are drug offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| They're, I would say they're right at the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| along with burglary and theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| So the existing recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| how would we look at dealing with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| top offenses right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Because those aren't offenses that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| with the state's recommendations that are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| that will continue to keep people in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Is that a fair assessment of that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Could you restate your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| So where are the initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| on behalf of the governor's initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| to look at the profile of inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Not to be in jail, but to be just ticketed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| and released on their own recognizance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| But they are sitting in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| They appear to be, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Yes. That's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| I just wanted to make sure I'm clear on that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| And the previous recommendations from 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| was there specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| that we have not done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Because I've seen the report from 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| because we haven't done those even recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| with a timeline associated with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| From the best that I could tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| there were very few recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| from the report from 10 years ago that were implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| So your report looks at some broad recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| but specifically, is there an established timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| on the short term that we could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| the number of length of stays at 34 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| and the cost benefits associated with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| So what kind of money would we be saving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| We could break the data set down a bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| to find out how many are getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| within 3 days, 10 days, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| So I'm not sure of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| That statement reflects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| It will impact not only the number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| that people are within our jail system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| and the recommendations that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| in terms of moving people through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| It would actually impact the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| of having a 200 bed facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| So there's a direct correlation between those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| I don't know that it would necessarily impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| the 200 bed facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| Again, our projections say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| if we can roll the average length of stay back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| to what it was 4 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| we're looking at approximately a 300 bed increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| over the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| And so these 200 beds fall apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| that we're talking about for intake housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| that's 2 thirds of your 300 bed increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| But then the top three offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| are impacted by that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| That's the reason I asked that first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| So if it's drug offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| we're housing people in a cell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| based on a drug offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Right. Now one thing we did not get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| was the types of drug offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| The way the offenses are listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| as the most serious offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| or the most serious charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| because as you know, a lot of defendants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| come in with multiple charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| And so these are listed by whatever charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| was the most serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| And so for those drug offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| that would be the most serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| of the one or however many offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| they're charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| And maybe this isn't clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| the number of inmates that are tagged with ICE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| and the percentage of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| that they are housed within our system is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| With ICE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| An ICE designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| I can't answer that one off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| I couldn't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| And it's an important profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| to figure out what impact that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| I'll take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Commissioner Gill, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| Okay. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Yeah. So, sir, I appreciate your time and being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| If I'm hearing you correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| and reading the report correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| the two main drivers are judicial process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| and the state not taking the TDOC prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Is that driving our numbers the most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| I would say the biggest one is the average length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| The TDOC numbers are impacting the population as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| Again, those are sentenced inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| and so they basically stay here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| until they can be taken to the DOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| And so I think in your words earlier in your statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| you were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| the TDOC number is a pretty good sized percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| of our population, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| They are more than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| And then I think what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| in a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| we started doing a lot of ROR and citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| and so the numbers have actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| although they've increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| the people that are going to jail today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| are not the same people that were going to jail five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| There's a lot more of those misdemeanors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| that would have went to jail five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| They're walking the streets with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| And so I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| but the two things that are driving the train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| the judicial process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| and I didn't know they weren't doing arraignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| on Saturday and Sundays anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| in the magistrate's office at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| They're not doing them Friday, Saturday, and Sunday anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| In the magistrate's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| they're not doing arraignments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Those are the two offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| we don't have any control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| TDOC and the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| I mean, they are by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I mean, everybody is a state employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| on the judicial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| And so we have no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| we can't tell the judges when to hold court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| We can't, this is going to have to be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| everybody hold hands together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| and get this thing done and put pressure on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| But the commission can't control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| either one of those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| The only thing we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| and I think it's a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| is to build a downtown processing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| for prisoners that are going to bond out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| because it just makes everything that much quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| But the two things that are driving the train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| we have no control over at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| And we can't cut their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| I mean, you can't cut judicial budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| and withhold things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| I mean, you can't cut it from the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| So, I mean, I hope we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| It's a lot of work to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| but the judges have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| whether they want more magistrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| to host these dockets or work later in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| That's really the things that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| And related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| I recall one of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| down in the report was related to advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| with our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| to possibly influence some of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| I know that that was one of y'all's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| which, who knows, could result in a change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Sir, thank you for your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| And to go off what Brad's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| yes, a lot of this we can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| We do have the purse strings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| but we are required to fund at certain levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| that probably wouldn't be significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| to put enough pressure on anybody to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| But you had, I think, four recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| to the downtown site we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| and that is an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| Expand about 200 beds down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| to where we can hold for 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| Expand courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| And access to service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| both private and public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| To me, that sounds a lot like a true justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| Do most towns this size, communities this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| have a true justice center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| where all these things work together in a synergy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Not nearly as many as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| I would say having the service providers on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| at a place like this may not be the norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| but I would suggest that it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| I think your assessment is a pretty good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| is pretty valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| that this would be a true justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| If we can't do more proactive work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| to help the defendants here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| to get connected to existing resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| to be able to better themselves in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| then we're just going to keep building more and more beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| because they're going to come back more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| And I guess that was kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| If we can, just because we can process people faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| doesn't mean they're not going to show up again faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| if we don't provide the things necessary to correct lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| It's not a problem that you can build your way out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| just by doubling the size of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| There's a lot of talk on a federal level, state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| about justice reform laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| and I believe that's something that's going to work its way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| down to the local level fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| Your analysis, you just can't predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| what those changes will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| to see what kind of impact they could have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| Do you have any of your experience, thoughts, wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| that you could share with us on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| States such as California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| have reduced their state prison population dramatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| but they've done so by pushing them back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| to the county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| And so while the number of state beds are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| the counties are exploding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| in turn they're providing state money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| in forms of grants to expand the size of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| You're just really rearranging deck chairs at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| and just moving out of this pocket of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| to their pocket of money over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| without necessarily really addressing the root cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| which I think access to a lot of these service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| can help address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| And you think it is a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| to have all these service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| in one location where they can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| and have synergy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| I don't know if I would set them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| so far as having their complete full office there on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| as opposed to having workstations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| with representatives there to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| touch these folks as they pass through the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| and on the way out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| I just wanted to recognize one of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| as part of your team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| our friend from Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| with the County Technical Assistance Service, Jim Hart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| I've appreciated your seminars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| from attending them in past years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| and appreciate your service as part of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| And I appreciate everybody else's service on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| It's good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Okay, you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| But Commissioner Gildee wanted me to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| I see your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| My question was cost by recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| Is that listed somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| so that we can get an indication of what those are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| For many of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| we can go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| and we can try and present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| develop a ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| potential cost for some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| But so far as the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| increasing the number of judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| or adding additional court dockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| is really kind of beyond what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| what we're able to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| The Chair will recognize the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| from the Barbara McMurray Architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| I'm Mike Dooley from Barbara McMurray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| What we've been tasked to do up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| is really gather all the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| and meet with all the groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| that affect this outcome, this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| The next steps would be to take a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| start putting pencil to paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| look at a program, size, cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| and develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| If there's any building that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| that would be the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Gentlemen, I've got kind of a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| I guess you say there's no such thing as dumb questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| We've been talking about need for a, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| downtown intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| And nobody's ever talked about a location of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| And if I'm Joe Q. Public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| if I'm watching this or if I've gone to our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| and I've pulled the presentation up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| a question I would probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| if I was Joe Q. Public would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| are you talking about modifying downstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| here in this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Are you talking about a brand new site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| When you think about a downtown intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| what's your general thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Is that something in this general footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| a new location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| Where are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| There's some general recommendations we could make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| There's options in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| There's also options outside of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| possibly connecting back to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| so we could build some new space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| offload some of the existing space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| renovate it so you've got some shared common spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| that you could start tag-teaming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| so to speak, and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| We haven't sat down and looked at actual square footages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| how big a foot plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| footprint would be for a site downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Kind of, Mr. Neerle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| what you're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| it could look like an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| to the building that we're sitting in right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| and using some of the preexisting space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| through modification and expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| that it could look like taking place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| I do not see any additional lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| Sorry, Justin, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| I just want to know how much this study costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| and how much an additional study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| to start putting in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| and things of that nature would cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| I don't have that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| All right, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| This study was $68,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| This was just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| It was not something that required a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| So thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| This is the tip of the iceberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| and hopefully the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| So I'm sure we'll be communicating with you more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| Thank you for your hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| Item number 51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| discussion item regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| ethics committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| My fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| I see Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| Here's what I'd like to do at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| We are almost at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| I'd like to have this one quick discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| and then close our meeting for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| to go into recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| conduct a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| and then we can come back to the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| if that's amenable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| Plus, I know everybody's going to need a brief break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| but I would like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| and have this brief discussion on the ethics commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| what we're going to do to promote the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| to get folks to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| and then at least at a minimum take a brief break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Although I think, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| when we sent out the press release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| for the public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| we would be having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| that public hearing, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| after our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| So that means we're going to have to finish the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| before we can do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| It said 6 o'clock or immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| I'll follow the word immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| I mean, we've got to kind of get to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Ms. Rausch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| I know most folks see you in your role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| with the Board of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| but I know you're here specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| in a different volunteer role that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| to explain that for us and for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| and then I'd like to have a brief discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| on some ways to promote applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| for the ethics commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| Sure, and thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| Jennifer Rausch, 1912 Shady Hollow Lane, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| I serve as chair of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| and we're really there to give a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| to the residents of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| in a process for them to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| credible complaints against county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| and elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| for potential violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| against the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| It's a very important committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| for bringing that voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| and having a process there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| Folks who have any interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| in serving on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| we meet quarterly unless we have a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Our meetings are very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| so the time commitment is usually very minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| unless we have a complaint before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| I'd like to recognize Kim Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| who's in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| She serves on the committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| And I believe...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| And Commissioner Schoonmaker is our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Mr. Schoonmaker...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| It's a running joke that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Well, John and I have a running joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| We'll just put it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| Excuse my omission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| for not recognizing the non-voting member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| but representative of Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| We have quarterly meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| and I believe up for appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| to start at our November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Commission will have two appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| and the mayor will have one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| And that will start in our November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| We meet the second Wednesday of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| I believe it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Well, it's the second Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| of one month every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| So I would encourage everybody to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| We're getting information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| through the Realtor Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7041)|
