| 0:00:00| to it until we kind of decided that's what we want to do. So that was the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| The second round was when we heard that they'd like the idea of pattern but to make it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| a little bit more arts and crafts. We presented that as part of option D. I think the feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=9)|
| 0:00:16| that we got back from many people was that it was a little bit too decorative, too ornamental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| maybe a little bit too busy. And we were asked to look at both dogwood as a pattern and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=20)|
| 0:00:28| also to look at kind of architectural elements as a pattern. The architectural elements worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| well in the sense that in the original options, one of the things that people liked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| option A was the metalwork ornamental piece of that. And while the physicalness of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=37)|
| 0:00:46| maybe not worked with where we've gone with the design, incorporating that as a graphic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| element seemed to work. So we were able to bring that element into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=50)|
| 0:00:58| And now these are just close-ups of the signs, the gateway signs. And again, in some locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| where possible, these could be illuminated. And we talked today in the steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| about possibly using solar power to do that as well. Identification of districts, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| it's maybe arts district, Market Square, Old City, and then also identification when you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| arrived at a destination. Here's the bulk of the system when you talk about vehicular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=85)|
| 0:01:33| signs on page C5. We have some strict traffic engineering criteria, three messages per panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=93)|
| 0:01:43| very specific typefaces, breakaway posts. We have to be seven feet to the bottom. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| we have to work within that engineering criteria to both create a unique system that has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| character to it. So we're using a kind of a traditional pole as the structure. The backs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| of the sign bring in the pattern and more arts and crafts type pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| If you look real close, you'll see we kind of even the rule line that separates the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| messages has a little bit of a twist to it, has kind of a unique flair. These are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| six-inch high vehicular directionals. After our steering committee meeting today, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| that silver bar, I think that's going to change a little bit, but you can get the sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| kind of the scale of what these signs have to be. You'll notice on the vehicular signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| again, with the three-inch messages, they're all very simple as far as you're driving in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| your car, you're going at a rate of speed, you have to make a decision. So the key is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| to make that information very simple and very clear. Use the pole, the back of the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| those sort of things to bring some character into these particular signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| In C7, we've just dropped them into some photos so you can start to see that. Then we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| on to the parking signs. Ann's going to hold that up. Part of what we did today is we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=187)|
| 0:03:26| printed out some full-size signs and we've taken them outside to start to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| This blue was the idea of kind of creating that identity for the parking. We still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| to tweak this a little bit to get a little more contrast, a little more legibility, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| the idea of the sign and where we're going with it, I think people were mostly favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| towards. We're also going to look at prototypes and I'll talk about that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| So there's a series of parking directional signs, the first three that direct to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| general parking. Then if there is a need to direct to a specific lot, and then the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| one potentially having kind of temporary signage, maybe for during a football game or some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| event where you could change it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| We've included multiple signs at parking, either at a lot or at a garage. We're giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| you kind of a variety of situations that could happen. You wouldn't necessarily have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| of these at each lot, but you would kind of choose which one was appropriate. We've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| included the change in the red text there, kind of changeable messages. Some of the garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| that at night, or they may be private during the day, at night they're used for events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| so that would give you the ability to kind of communicate that to people or on the weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| when they're more public than private. And then the service signs, again, staying at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| the vehicular level to the hospital trails and bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| We transition to directional pedestrian scale directional signs, and you'll note that pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| signs can have more listings. We can get up to eight, six, eight, ten listings. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| signs are double-sided, and they will, for the most part, we want to locate them on existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| poles, and that's what you see on the left. We provided a design with a new pole for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| that maybe isn't possible. We have full-size mock-ups of that sign here, and again, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=334)|
| 0:05:42| is something we took outside today, and I think we were all pretty pleased with how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| it appeared when we took it outside. These signs are typically double-sided, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| they have more listings on them. We've used a serif type face, a little bit nicer. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| can kind of play with that on pedestrian rather than on vehicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| Orientation maps. These will be heads-up, meaning that if you are looking at it, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| you're facing is at the top, so it gives you an orientation. And these are, as we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| the programming, we'll find appropriate spots where this might be a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| The last sign type is kiosks. One of the things we looked at at the very beginning are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| kiosks that are out there on the streets now. We had hoped to try and reuse those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| some cases, but found that structurally they're not as sound as we had hoped, so we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| at new kiosks, and we're still kind of figuring out the program of those, meaning that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| we're showing there is a four-sided kiosk. On kind of the large side, side A and B, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| be maybe a downtown map, and on the other side maybe a city-wide map to give you kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| of an idea of where you're adjacent to, such as the university. And then on the sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| providing a space where people can tack things, because what we're finding is on the kiosks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| that are out there, people do it anyway, so why don't we, you know, just like if we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| doing a college campus, we utilize these all the time, where if they're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| putting that stuff on there and we're not going to get away with it, why don't we at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| least give them an appropriate space for that kind of information, so it doesn't get visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| clutter. So those are the sign types and where we are. Our next steps are we certainly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| after our meeting today a couple of design tweaks with color, pattern, and some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| smaller elements, but we feel based on the comments that we've gotten, both in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| meetings and from the website, we feel like we're in a pretty good place with the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| We are beginning programming of where the signs go and what they say. That's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| a very detailed version that we'll be working with staff. It'll be a process as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| We are looking to build a couple prototypes, actual signs, a couple sign types so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| we can get kind of very final looks at design, and we think it's a helpful thing to do at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| this point. And then we are also looking at a phasing plan based on budget and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| we think the priorities are. I think at the moment we feel priorities are parking, getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| people to parking, parking garages, and pedestrian signage. So we'll see what components we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| do as the budgets become available. I think that's going to be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=516)|
| 0:08:44| We'll open up the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you for your presentation. It's good work. I'm curious to know, what is the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| of wayfinding in the city? I'm sure you've looked into that because it seems like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| a sort of a learned avoidance of looking at signs because a lot of them are not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| We're first time visitors. We like to say that. So we try and look at, I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=547)|
| 0:09:16| a little different viewpoint of knowing where to go or trying to understand the orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| of it. From a historical standpoint, there's been a lot of, with the World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| there's certainly wayfinding signage down there. We looked at the kiosks as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| the process to see how we could use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| Do you have any sense of how we use signs in our community, if it's any different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| anywhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| I think from a parking standpoint, it seems to be the biggest aspect of it and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| that you have a lot of activities downtown. So you have a lot of temporary needs as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| as permanent needs. I know we talked to police regarding the events and how the wayfinding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=602)|
| 0:10:12| may be a little bit different, like during a UT football game and how you get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| to parking then compared to, you know, from day-to-day basis and how the parking is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| day-to-day compared to evening. So that's why we had those temporary elements in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| like the electronic board in the parking and the temporary panel on the parking as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| Was there any interface with CAT, public transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Yeah. If I can offer, we've had folks, we have a 10-member steering committee and folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| from Belinda Whittle Brill has been part of our steering committee. She wasn't able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| be here today, but we've also engaged, we had about 70 different groups represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| including businesses and restaurants and hotels and those folks who did a very intensive two-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| session with us in March of this year to really figure out what are their needs and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| priorities for directing people to their services. And CAT is definitely someone that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| working with. And in fact, one of the things that we're working on right now is partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| our sign projects. They're getting ready to open the new transit center and as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| of that, they're doing a new wayfinding package for their directional signs to pick up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| trolleys and things like that. And they've actually asked to basically borrow elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| so that the signs are complementary and that we're not duplicating signs where we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| potentially have one sign that functions for both purposes. So we're definitely working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| very closely with CAT to try and make this system as efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| We also know with DOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| We also know with DOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| How far out does the program go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| In terms of the general area, land area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| For example, I saw in here there's a sign that said downtown north. So does it go all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| the way up to where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Sure. The current boundaries, and this is something that we explored through our wayfinding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| analysis, which is kind of the previous phase, which John actually has a book on that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| can pass that along as well. But the general boundaries of this specific project are from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| 11th Street on the west side to the river on the south side, east to the Coliseum, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| then north to basically the railroad tracks and the beginning of the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| One of the aspects that we wanted to accomplish with the design portion of this was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| to create a family of signs that we could then take and expand to the downtown core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| neighborhoods as those projects get expanded and there's money to expand the wayfinding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| So we've actually looked at kind of thinking about the neighborhoods such as Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| Avenue and downtown north and Magnolia and directionals to the south waterfront and into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| the south waterfront area as kind of a next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| We're not specifically representing those graphically at this time, but the family of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| signs is broad enough that we can expand that out in the future if we have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Majority signs will be located in those downtown boundaries. There will be a handful of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| outside of that pointing you to downtown, and I think along the edges of downtown there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| will be a handful of signs directing to those adjacent neighborhoods, not necessarily individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| destinations in them, but to get people out to them so that you can eventually go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Yeah, I'm pretty impressed with what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I think a lot of it looks real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| I have a problem with my throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| I was looking at the comments on the pattern page, C2, the two originals, patterns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| were proposed, the woodcut and the arts and crafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| And I understand on the woodcuts being more specific to Knoxville, the concern there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| I can sort of see the two ornate and two frilly on the particular patterns that were proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| or indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Did you say frilly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| It says right here, two frilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Two frilly, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| I'm just reading what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| But I'm looking at the next page, C3, the gateway signs and you have a fairly large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=876)|
| 0:14:44| obelisk or whatever you want to call that, this large surface with a banner hanging off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| of it or a banner type sign showing the dogwoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Is this final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Is this what is proposed at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Because you talk about looking frilly and prissy and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| I mean, that's the way that strikes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| To me, it's just like, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| That's too much of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| I mean, I understand the dogwood concept, but that's a personal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| That's a taste thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| I'm just articulating my response to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| I said to the steering committee earlier today, if we're down to color and pattern, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| If we get a lot of feedback that we're still not there with the pattern, that's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| something we can look at very easily and provide options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| We just wanted to kind of show where we are, kind of how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| I don't know from the steering committee if we feel like we're totally right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| I think we're fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| I think also with the gateway signs, the pattern is fine enough that when you pull it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=946)|
| 0:15:57| away, it's going to look different than if you're looking at the detail work of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| It has an aspect of changeability with perspective, but it's certainly something that we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| if we feel like that's too busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| We could certainly make the pattern maybe larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| One of the things we looked at, what we liked about this pattern, and if you look at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| sign types, and let's see if I can pull these up, is that the pattern, you see it by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| there, but as we multiplied it, we found ways of maybe having different levels of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| There can be a lot of it, like in this version, or it can be very simple, so you can see at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| the bottom of that pattern, the bottom of that sign, it's just one element of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| It gave us that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| If the pattern's good, it may be just the amount of pattern that we're using from sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| type to sign type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| It's just on the gateway signs that massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I think the gateways, it may be the way that we're rendering at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| We wanted to show more that it was illuminated, so it would have a high contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| Most of the time when the pattern appears on the signs, it's a very tonal, kind of tone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| on tone effect, rather than, and probably during the day, that's how that would appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| but at night it would be brighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| At night it would be pretty, it would really jump out at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Going over to C7, I realize these are just, this is kind of what this sign would look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| like in this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| The message is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| The message is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Yeah, well, I'm not concerned about the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| I'm sure, I would hope that that would be gotten right, but the example, the rendering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| in the lower right hand corner in particular, and also the one above it, you have the double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| posted signs placed in sidewalks, especially the lower, the one on the lower right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| I would hope that we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Walking sidewalk, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| It's actually in there to show the problems that you have when you have to do double posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| signs, so it's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Maybe we should label it a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| We have to have everyone start to understand that when you're on roadways that have a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| speed, and we have to put a big sign, that it doesn't always work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| We've tried to include that to kind of make that point that you lose your ADA accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| When we start to locate them, we will start to look at solving that problem, but we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| it in there to kind of start to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| The C9, the parking signs with the changeable message section, did we end up, we exempted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| those, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| So that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| The other thing I wanted to say about that is those are fully programmable, so that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| say anything we wanted it to, because I know that, I don't know if we'll ever get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| but some cities have smart parking programs where they actually tell you availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| of spaces in a particular garage, and if we're going to do that, obviously that would give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| us the capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| So I think that would be a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| I said it before in one of the workshops or somewhere, this kind of approach, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| What it does is it makes all our standard signs that our engineering department, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| running down our engineering department, but that our sign people put out, the no parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| signs, the signs that you see all around downtown that have the unistrut, unipole kind of standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| and just the typical MUTCD signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| They're ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| They're often in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I know that's not what you were charged with dealing with, but I would love now that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| got this to find a way to begin to address that signage too, and if you have any comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I'd love to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| One thing I should have mentioned earlier, and I usually do at the beginning, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| keep in mind that this program replaces all wayfinding signs that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| We're not adding to what's out there from a wayfinding standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| We're removing wayfinding signs, and where you have an intersection where you get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| and there's three or four signs of all different sizes, shapes, and mounting heights, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| putting one sign with three messages in a single panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| So just by doing that, hopefully that will clean up some of the visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| We did talk today in the steering committee meeting about just the fact that you brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| up regarding the traffic regulatory signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Really, that is a whole other animal of scope, but you can start to see what comes out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| this program is, say, the poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Maybe painting all the poles black would help that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Coming up with the standard mounting height, those kind of little things will help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| the reduction of visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| In the future, as we begin to replace those signs, if we have a program and we know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| we want to go, it may be the next administration or whatever, but we know kind of where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Comments from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Well, I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I represent a district that's totally outside the downtown area, and the only problem I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| can see with this is that right away I can tell you that there will be disappointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| that the second district, the west area of town, doesn't have uniform signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| You know, I can see that that's going to be an ongoing ask or beg or demand or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1297)|
| 0:21:47| And I know that it would be extremely attractive in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| And I know there have been other efforts to incorporate, you know, a traditional pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| for particularly the Bearden area and the Sutherland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| So, you know, just expect that I may be gone, but you'll hear from my folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| I guess I'd like to just offer the comment that we'd like downtown to lead by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Oh, we'll tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| This project is setting a great example that really offers a great opportunity for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| neighborhoods and other areas of the city of Knoxville to be able to follow suit as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| budget and time become available and interest on the part of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| That's really critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| And I so agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| And with the new logos that are going to become standard for this area of town where the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| extend, you know, in all directions, there's going to be great interest in having the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| logo identifying a greenway, for instance, or any other of these institutional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| So, I just expect that there's going to be a lot of desire to emulate downtown in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| It's really not that uncommon for a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| I mean, we don't do a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| There's only a handful of cities where we've done this, the whole city at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| I'm sure, financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Usually, it's kind of the downtown and then it spreads out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| We did, to a certain extent, as we designed this, have in mind that it could expand farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| And that's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| That pattern is kind of one of the kit of part elements that you could certainly change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| out once it got beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Well, it just seems to me that it would be expected that, for instance, the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| certain areas that do extend throughout the city, need to be identified with the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| logos and the same expected visuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So, I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| But I certainly, I mean, I already can feel the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Well, and actually, one of the great things about this is we worked with our greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| coalition and the folks from the TPO and MPC that had created the greenway logo, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| they are already getting funding to start implementing signs along the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And we've actually brought that into our downtown wayfinding package and created a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1452)|
| 0:24:19| sign that incorporates that logo so that it does become a consistency factor throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Well, and Councilman Woodhull wisely inquired about CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| And that's another aspect of signage that is crucial, that it be recognizable wherever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| So, I think there are certain types of signs that are going to be probably the next addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1477)|
| 0:24:46| of this project, in my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| And I maybe won't be here to make those comments, but I would hope that that would be the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Going back to page C7, it just kind of caught my eye, and I don't know if anybody thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Probably not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| The photo at the lower left, northbound Gay Street at the north end of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| I forget what you call the frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| It used to be one of several that held the trolley wires when there was a streetcar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I believe that's what the original purpose was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| If you look at the alternative, it's probably the only example we had, so it probably isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yeah, these really were just to kind of drop them into a couple photos to give you a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| of how...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| I was just wondering, did anybody look at the possibility of using that for mounting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Of using the truss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Yeah, the truss, I guess you'd call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| We will probably start to look at that a little bit closer now that we're starting to locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| signs, and that certainly could be an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| We have to see structurally how, you know, if it could hold a wind load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Sure, it's a minor thing, but it's just an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I just wondered about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| We also might have to go to the Historic Zoning Commission to be able to do that, since it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| actually part of the structure, but we could certainly investigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| Other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| Other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Ms. Wallace, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Well, I guess I'd just like to offer the opportunity, if there are any folks from the public who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| have comments or questions regarding this project, we'd certainly be happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| those at this time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Are we in public forum now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| I think once I sit down, we're in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| We have one person signed up in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| John Craig, please state your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| John Craig, 12226 Brighton Court, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| I'm president of the Market Square District Association, and we very much support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| This has been a long-standing goal of Market Square District Association and our merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| We've been very fortunate to have a lot of new businesses opening up in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| downtown, and as each one opens, it brings new people to downtown, and signage and way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| finding is really critical for helping to make those folks feel comfortable as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| come down and start exploring around and learning more about downtown or relearning downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| So we think that's going to be a major plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| It's been a very good public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| We think the committee was a little too quick to dismiss our suggestion that all signs should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| just point people to Market Square and let them find their way from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| But that aside, we do actually appreciate the attention that was discussed earlier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| the connections to the other neighborhoods and the other developments that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| on in the neighborhoods around downtown because we think those folks will need to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| reconnected to downtown as they used to be, and that they're an important part of keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| downtown vibrant and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| So we're very supportive of this, and we'll move forward with all deliberate speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I thought you were going to propose that we put massive photovoltaic arrays on all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| We can discuss that if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you, Mr. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Anybody else in the audience who would like to speak, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| State your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Daniel Hsu, 230 East Oklahoma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Good evening, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Sounds like great steps forward in getting this wayfinding underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I think it's definitely needed downtown and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| A couple comments I'd like to add would be on some lower cost options for the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1734)|
| 0:29:05| that could be implemented throughout the city, maybe using the city sign department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| So overhead signs, also in downtown and around, maybe the street signs, the identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| of the street signs, and being able to identify the districts on the street signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| I think the color coordinating that's on the plans looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| That can be carried through with the street signs and also with a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| They've got the maps there, so if the maps have the color coding on there, you can kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| of get yourself oriented with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| On the design and the overall design that would then be used throughout the city, ostensibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1783)|
| 0:29:54| through west and everywhere, I was surprised that there wasn't anywhere where the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| logo was incorporated more into that design, the sort of flowing river theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| I think that looks, I think there's, as part of the city overall package, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| that could be incorporated a little bit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Not that it's the overall design, but somehow that the sign itself somehow incorporates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| that sort of theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| The blue signs, those directional signs, they just don't do it for me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| I think that they are obtrusive and they don't offer much to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1828)|
| 0:30:37| I'm not sure how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| They're big squares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I don't know if there's something that can be modified in the design of it that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| it's not a square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| There were some that had a curved part on the bottom that I think those were a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| bit more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Then in implementation, I think I read over that it's kind of going from out to in in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1854)|
| 0:31:03| the implementation strategy, getting people off the interstate and in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| I didn't see anything that was actually proposed to actually be put on the interstate signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| directing people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I think that's something that could be certainly looked at as starting out there on the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| on the overhead signs, on the interstate, and then directing people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| I think that as you drive down I-40, you get this nice new interstate going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| For people driving through, it's kind of not the most attractive looking place from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1894)|
| 0:31:43| interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I think that they need to be led off the interstate into downtown and into downtown north, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| is I'm vice president of the Downtown North Association and chairman of marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| What we're trying to do is to develop ourselves as a district of downtown and not be separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| We'd like to be a part of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| We'd like to continue this signage on out through there so that we get incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| Certainly, we've got a lot of great new businesses opening up in the downtown north area who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| really need signage such as this in order to survive so that they get the traffic out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| there so that people know these businesses are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| We've had a couple of businesses that have opened and then closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| I think that part of it is that there's no way finding at all out there to even identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| downtown north as a district at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| That's why I was looking at some of the lower cost options where we could start to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| that up towards our area too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Obviously, sooner rather than later would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| You talked about street signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| You're talking about the street identification signs and corners and intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| I've seen examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| You may have seen them like the City of Maryville and their historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| The signs are black with silver letters on the boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| It actually says City of Maryville in small letters and it has the name of the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Is that the kind of thing you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| I've seen them where they actually have a piece at the top which has the city logo on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| the top of it or whatever the design theme is that you come up with at the top and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| the street sign at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Once again, if you color coded those with your district, I think that it would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| people to way find too because they look up and they see a pink sign and they remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| pink is theater district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| I'm not sure that somehow that color coding gets incorporated into maybe a piece on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2021)|
| 0:33:49| sign and that brackety piece that we saw the theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| If that bracket piece were to be able to be incorporated or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| I think that somehow getting the theme through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| These blue signs have no theme at all to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Can I offer a comment regarding the city logo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| We actually had a discussion about that very early on with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| One of the major concerns that came about was that city logos are typically functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| of the administration that's present at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| We were very concerned about the longevity and viability of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| We actually discussed using similar color palettes to what's in the logo as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| to just the logo or finding ways to incorporate the logo in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| We felt that that was a pretty dicey move to maintain these signs over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| It's certainly something that we appreciate the thought behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| We felt like with the intent that this program would be something that could last for 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| to 20 years and possibly beyond that, we wanted to be careful not to do something that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| date stamp it or something that someone in another administration might want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| simply because of the logo factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Taking these things, I think it was a good point about the overhead signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| I think that's going to be a whole lot less cost if you can incorporate these things into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| existing overhead lines or somehow get these things off of the pedestrian way where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| might block things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| I think that's probably a pretty good idea and a lower cost option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| Back to another point, you were talking about signage on the interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| John Hunter is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| He escaped from TDOT recently and he could tell you as well as anybody how difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| that is in dealing with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| They adhere to the MUTCD and they have very, very strict standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| I'm not saying they won't ever do anything, but it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| They have the identification signs at almost every exit for food and lodging and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| The logo signs, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I don't know if you like the way they look or not, but they will do logo signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| That's a very specific program, very, very specific for interstate exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| A couple of thoughts that we in managing the project and the steering committee have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| on that issue was one, consistency of language, making certain that whatever appears on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| interstate signs is what appears on signs as you're going into the downtown area so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| that we make certain that we're calling everything the same thing and you don't end up with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| different signs calling the same destination something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| In addition to that, the idea of the gateways where we have opportunities alongside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| right-of-way associated with an interstate, utilizing those gateway features to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| capture the eye and then we can sort of in some ways skirt around the MUTCD standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| and the requirements that TDOT has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| But we have been talking with them and trying to incorporate their requirements and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| our desires into the final product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Ms. Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| I was so interested in the comment you made about the big blue signs because I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| well, I'm just going to give away the fact that there may be some generations between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| So it gave me the courage to comment on the big blue signs do nothing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| That was my big disappointment in the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| And I just have to say, look, there's a lot of big blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| If you want to see big blue, well, head for Lexington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| But that's just not, you know, what makes us tick around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| So anyway, I just felt like basically they're very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| The blue does not, in my mind, become a part of the exterior environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| And to me, visually it's disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| Now, I'm not a blue person, so maybe it just goes right back to that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| But I was so interested to hear you make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Your comments about the interstate are something that have interested me for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| and recognizing how difficult it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| But saying at the same time how easy it has been in recent years to work with DDOT in so many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| and to also have heard so many comments about the new interstate and how wonderful it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| But it really doesn't give Knoxville the visibility and the accessibility that people had hoped it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| So I think that is an extremely worthy project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| In fact, I think it is absolutely imperative that we consider the importance of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| and you're calling them gateways, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| But for those folks who are driving through to know about the opportunities in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| how to do that, you know, I'd be happy to be involved in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| because that's something I've thought about for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| I like some of the comments about the more traditional signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| for the more historic areas and so on in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| You know, I like the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| I like the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| But I really want us to get it right right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| So that it fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| And say what you will, Knoxville is an incredibly fascinating, eclectic city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| I happened to be in the Bank of America on the seventh floor yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Oh, my gosh, just go up there and take a little elevator ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| and go up and look down and see how fascinatingly eclectic it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| So I think our signage should also reflect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| and have some signs that are more traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| and have a bit more of a historic approach as buildings and the spires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| and the towers that you look down upon do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| And at the same time, the contemporary fascination of the newness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| and the contemporaneous says a great deal for this being an old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| with a rich heritage which, you know, incorporates the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| and is excited about the new, but it wants to blend the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| And that was the one thing that I found kind of missing in that schematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| that you finally came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| So I probably just wouldn't kill myself over the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| if we just could work out the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| and then really look at an opportunity along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| And having John with us is just great because he knows some of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| and we might not, you know, get our hands slapped as much when we go to TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| if we had a little guidance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| So, you know, I'm excited about the city doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| and I'm excited about being here to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| But I really just beg you to stay with it, do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| And I think some good comments have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| some real positive comments have been made this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Are there people from the audience who want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Oh, we've got a line forming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I'll make this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| My name is Patrick Hunt, 1111 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| I'm also the Chairman of the Board of the Central Business Improvement District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| While our board has not considered this project as a formal matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| I think I feel confident in saying that we support the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| and the direction of the project fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| I think there's two comments that I think are pretty key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| I should say, I should probably clarify that I actually invited some former colleagues of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| that currently work at a firm that actually bid on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| just to put that out there so that, you know, there's no bias there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| I did not actually arrive late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I did not see the designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| I'm not going to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I think critically we have to look at sort of two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| One is accuracy, and I know you haven't gotten to that level yet in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| but if the signs aren't accurate, the design doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| And two is maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| If we're going to put maps on these signs, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| we have a lot of maps in downtown today and they're out of date, they're inaccurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| they don't help people find their way, which is the entire intent of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| And so we really need to think about that long-term process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| and I know that Anne and others have those issues forefront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| but as we as a community think about extending this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| and think about, you know, really making it work for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| that's what we have to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Is it accurate and can we afford to maintain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| and keep it accurate over some period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| If we can accomplish those two goals, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I think that the issues of sort of color and structure and materiality, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| those are things we can probably all sort of learn to live with and adjust over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| But I think that if we don't meet those two key objectives, then I think we've failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| So I applaud the efforts of Anne and her team and MERS and City Council for taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| And CBID, I'm sure as it comes up at future meetings of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| that we will give it very serious consideration and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| But we appreciate the efforts that everybody's put forth today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Your comment on maps being out of date, I think it was on volunteer landing the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| I noticed the maps on one kiosk or one sign set up that were so deteriorated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| that you couldn't even read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| So we've got that problem too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| So maintainability and, you know, long-term durability are both issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Let me ask, do we have a long-term maintenance budget thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| sort of what we're committing ourselves to every year on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| The general rule of thumb is whatever from a construction budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| whatever you put in you can count on 10% to 15% of that annually for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| So if you put in $300,000 worth of signage, then you're looking at $30,000 a year to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| and again that includes replacing signs that get hit, adding new destinations if they come on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| the labor and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| So that's kind of the ballpark that we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| Ms. Rowdy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| I was just going to clarify for the public that's here, and Ms. Laws, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| but my understanding is that the council has only approved an item in a budget that paid for this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| but contemplation of adopting the monies that it would take to implement this study has not yet been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| Actually, you all did address in this fiscal year's budget the first phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| and programming the funding for that phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| and there has been $300,000 set aside to implement phase one of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| And so the maintenance that we're discussing then would be a part of that $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| We would contemplate part of that, setting aside part of that $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| It certainly could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| That's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| It's a very important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I'm not speaking in one speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| We have other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| State your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Try not to be too nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| My name is Tommy Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I live at 9424 Polo Club Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| I designed the logo for the city of Knoxville, and I understand the reasoning behind not using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| What I'm up here mostly to talk about is to reinforce some of the conversations they've had about maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| I've had mapping conversations for years about what might happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| There's a standard map for Knoxville that Will Fontenez at the University of Tennessee has managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| and which is produced and printed inside the Tourism and Sports Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| Their logo, too, is presented in their map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| There's maps that went on the signage out here that came from a completely different resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| We have in our city a company called Smart Maps, which provides transit maps all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| We have a transit map in our community that we use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| When you think about what happens if you travel to Paris, we talk about visitor experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| and that the signage is something that enhance this brand in terms of its generating positive experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2801)|
| 0:46:49| Good wayfinding does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I noticed that there's a pedestrian kiosk that has what looks like another map on it for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| I just am here pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| What an opportunity we have to try to develop for Knoxville a consistent map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| In a perfect world, we might have a printed map that a visitor to Knoxville might receive in print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| or they might find it on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Then they might arrive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Then the signage components that they experience when they get here would be consistent in terms of the presentation of that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| I would hope that we could possibly work towards a map that maybe is not completely recreated by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| By the way, there are some beautiful maps that have been done recently by a fellow named John Ennis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| I forgot the name of his company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| He's a lifelong Knoxville resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| One of them is the restaurant map that's being published in Metropulse currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| This guy is one of the finest map designers in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| He did one recently for San Francisco, and he's done them for other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| I would strongly suggest we might do some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| User-friendly maps, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| User-friendly maps, I think, is what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Very fine company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Excellent map designer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| He, in fact, originated the idea that came to a company called Smart Maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| The notion of Smart Maps is a Knoxville resource that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| That is one way that we can most definitely sustain a program like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Then that thing could possibly be used elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| That's primarily what I was up here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I've been arguing for that for so many years, that we have a continuous experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| and that all the different organizations work together to help manage the experience of a visitor to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| I have one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| I also designed the logo for the Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| and I've seen renderings of dogwoods all around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Mr. Hulkus, I have to say that you are exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| For me personally, I hate that motif of the dogwood that's on that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| If you guys could please revisit that graphic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I actually like the ornate component on there better than that particular display, especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| The science program itself is beautiful throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| but I do think that that is something that could be a little better executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| That little piece right there I think we could fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| I just want to address the maps real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| At the moment, we are just saying the kiosk will have a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| I don't even think it's in our scope to design a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Now is a good time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| I agree there should be one map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| We always strongly recommend that you have one map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| That's what you see on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| That's what you see on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| That's what you see in a printed piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| At the moment, it's just a matter of saying the kiosk has a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| Which map it is is still left to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| Yes, hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| My name is Marlene Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| I live at 1935 Cherokee Boulevard in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| I was on University of Tennessee when we did our campus design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| and looked at signage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| My plea here is for simplicity and consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| and I will have two requests for our sign consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| But I would say, Councilman Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| I agree about the observation about those gateway signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| that it's more pattern than the name of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| especially if it's going to be illuminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| We could look at more simple, more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Barbara Pilo just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I was going to say I agreed with her comment about more consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Her second comment was about more variety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| and I think we need to keep these things consistent and recognizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| I think we need to, I agree with the comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| to coordinate with neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| and certainly agree with the comment about a consistent map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| I hope that you can fund the design of the map out of the existing funding perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| Regarding the two requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| I'm on the board of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| so we know that we spent as a city a long time looking at EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| and digital signage and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| And if indeed we have some changeable electronic signage for the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| I think we should maybe try to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| and minimize when that's actually turned on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| so that if indeed we have it, it's only during special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| and it doesn't end up being a kind of ongoing representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| of things that are happening just normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| It should be a very exceptional use of that because it is an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| The second request is regarding the comment about consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| and simplicity related to neighborhoods, street signage, CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| the logo for the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I think that in our request to the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| it might be really good if you could show how this system could be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| to street signs, to CAT, to greenways, to Cumberland Avenue, to Downtown North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| So even though you're not designing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| and even though we're not funding that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| anyone that's going to be replacing signs in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| or developing ideas would begin to get an idea of how that would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| So those are my observations and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Anybody else from the public who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Appreciate the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| My name is Brian Pittman, and I live at 623 West Hill Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| five doors down on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I only had two comments earlier, but after everybody else started talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| it kind of got a little more elaborated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| I'll try to go fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Overall, I think the design is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| It's very classy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| It's, for the most part, simple and professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| And I agree with some of the commentary about the colors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| and the patterns and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| I agree that the patterns are getting a little fussy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| But what I really liked about what Daniel said was maybe the pattern is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| opportunity to demarcate the differences in the different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| as we go forward with spreading it about the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I agree that the two pole signs on sidewalk is probably not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| Maybe if we were to restrict the two poles for spots that are in a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| area and in some grass or landscaping, maybe that would help separate the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| so that anything that's actually in a pedestrian walkway is just a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| That would simplify that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| But also, when you do have a larger sign that needs two poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| you find a place for it in the grass so it doesn't get in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| The color coding, I think, per neighborhood is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| But if it's just downtown for now, I think it would be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| that it's all one color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Whether it's blue, whether it's red, it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| I just think one color to stick with that cohesive feel so that when someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| is new to town, they don't know Knoxville, they see one sign, it's purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| I'm looking for a purple sign from that point on until I get to where I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| The other towns I've visited that were successful, picked a style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| picked a color, went with it, and it was consistent, and it worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| I have to disagree with Ms. Pelow about what I would call ye old design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| and pretend that these signs are all old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I think what you've done with having the more antique pole but a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| sign banner is a nice mix between the two that answers to both the modern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| parts of Knoxville and the more traditional parts of Knoxville all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| one element, and there's no need really to reinvent the wheel with every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| I think the pattern and the color is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| Last but not least, but very important to me, is please, must we have fake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| stone at the base of everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I'm sorry, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| It's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Those are actually suggested to be real stone for the base, and the thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| behind that was folks were interested in pulling in an environmental element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| that was local to Knoxville and the history with the marble background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| Okay, well then it needs to be marble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| If you go and you look at signs like that that have a rusticated stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| that's Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| That's not Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| I think it's neat and it's appropriate direction, but Knoxville was not known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| as the stone city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| It was known as the marble city, and we still are in a way, and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| classy if we can afford it, but if we can't, I'd like to keep that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Every one of the signs I saw were really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| They were classy, but when we got to the ones that had the stone at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| bottom, it felt very suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| It felt kind of like a mall, and I don't think that's, I actually don't see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| whole lot of those going in, so if it happened, it wouldn't kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I do also agree with the little cut Daniel was talking about at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| I really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| It did look a little sail-like, but it still kept it a little interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| Can I address that because I haven't heard that a lot today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Just a little background on it, and maybe it's the menu of sign types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| We had originally had an option that had, it's hard to see there, it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| bottom one where it had that kind of sail, and it's a good description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| because that's what people use, kind of cut to it, and we got a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| feedback that people did not like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| It was too nautical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| So what we tried to do with the new version is we did keep it, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| this slide isn't great because it's so far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| We did keep it in the parking signs and in the pedestrian signs, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| didn't appear in the vehicular signs, mainly because we felt it was easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| from a cost standpoint, easier to do it with the parking and the pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| There will be a lot of pedestrian signs, so the majority of the system will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| have the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| To do it with the vehicular signs on that big panel we thought may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| troublesome over time and from a maintenance standpoint and reordering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| panels and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| We did talk today about maybe putting some kind of graphic that hints to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| on the vehicular signs so they're not such big blue signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| So I think the vehicular signs will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| We've heard it a number of times today that they were just too big, blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| and rectangular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| So half the system had it, half the system didn't, and that was a reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| of the comments when we got back from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091015streetsignageworkshop?start=3470)|
