| 0:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Madam Chair, were you sworn in, Mr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| I didn't see you stand up, so I'm making sure that you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Yes, I was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| I'm looking to postpone this to January, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| With our workload here lately, we haven't got all our ducks in a row, and to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| we could possibly reset to or postpone until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Just to clarify with the Law Director, typically the Commission has to suggest a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| The applicant typically can't request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| They can request it, but they can't make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| You have to vote to make it happen, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| So then at this point, if anyone's entertaining that, then this would be the point to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| I'll offer that motion, that we postpone this until the January Zoning Meeting, January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| 2023 Zoning Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Motion to postpone to the January Zoning Meeting by Commissioner Beeler, with a second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Even though this is not relevant to the motion, but since we had opposition here, is it possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| we could hear what they were opposed to, so that the developer then could possibly work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| that out in the next 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Mr. McKenzie, I'm assuming that that would be you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Please come forward to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=938)|

| 0:15:54| Overdevelopment has burdened our roads and infrastructure terribly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Shenandoah Elementary is overcrowded already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| The location in question is on top of a serious network of sinkholes, with a major sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| opening on the property itself, and other major openings all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| When a speaker before the Planning Commission brought up the fact that mass development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| in the area had already resulted in more water running on her property, with occasional flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| the Planning Commission simply told her that the engineers guaranteed everything would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| be fine, completely sidestepping the fact that things were already not fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| In turn, the turn for school buses and students at Shenandoah is already dangerous, and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| a blind hill, right where this development would be, our roads are backed up horribly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=993)|

| 0:16:45| to fix things, I've seen Old Broadway, where it runs into Tazewell Pike, backed up completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| across the interstate exit, even after 6 in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Broadway itself is often as bad or worse than Kingston Pike these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| What did the Planning Commission say about our congestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| One suggested we should learn to take other roads, like Murphy Road, as if other roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| were already clogged also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| They also said that we should have accepted more traffic lights on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| While it's true that traffic patterns sometimes require traffic lights, traffic lights do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| not speed up major thoroughfares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| It seems like the prime directive of the Planning Commission is to build as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| as fast as possible and excuse it in any way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| There is also some very real confusion, at least in my mind, regarding the plans of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| There are no drawings of what he proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| The zoning request is for four houses per acre on over 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| In speaking with locals in the last few days, I was told by one homeowner that she was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| by the builder that he was only planning to build three or four homes for relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| Another said that he was told that the builder was going to build 20 homes in the front and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| three or four for relatives in the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| He seems to have aimed to convince locals that they should sit quietly because if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| didn't do this, someone else would do worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I happen to know for a fact that some homeowners in the area decided not to actively oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| the rezoning based on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| As I stand here, the only thing I know for sure is that the zoning request is for four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| houses an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Why is a rezoning even necessary if what he has told locals is true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| There's just not enough infrastructure in the area for 40 new homes or even 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| What do we get if we have to improve Tassel Pike with more lanes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| We get an entire area with many beautiful old yards torn up for a sterile utilitarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| highway costing us more in taxes that destroys the nature of our own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| The taxpayers are ultimately who will pay for all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| With the rate of movement into the area, you can build schools and roads and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| else to the end of time and it won't keep up with demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| In fact, it's only going to increase demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Ultimately I appeal to the developer himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| If he prides himself on being a local and cares about his local community, then he should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| care about the interests of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Even 20 condominiums is counter to our interests and even his own long-term interests if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| intends to remain and enjoy the beauty left of this community for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Mr. Wilson, would you like to respond to anything and then we will move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Just to the commission, to come up here and essentially question my character of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| I've told anybody in the community is completely untrue and is disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| It is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I am going to build my personal house on the property with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| That's all that's been told and so I would just like to make sure everyone knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| I've never sent an email to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| So can I see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1207)|

| 0:20:54| I've had ideas of, you know, some condos up front and my personal home in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| I've had ideas of just keeping and building my own house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| So that's one big reason I need to postpone this to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| But as far as the zoning goes, MPC had essentially approved or not approved, but had recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:21| approval on five per acre there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| The chance that I build that many houses may not happen, but it's my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| And I feel that my property should be zoned properly like everybody else's is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| Would I build all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| But to have the opportunity to build those is in my right as the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| And I believe, like I said, somebody I saw a lot of stuff on Facebook that opposing me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| and a guy commented on said, they said, don't take the horse farm and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| He said, well, everybody's house is on a farm and everybody's house is built on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| There's development all up Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| He's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| There's development all up Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Why would I be the one to come in here and be told no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| So he kind of makes my point for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| If Tassel Pike is overdeveloped, then why do I have to stand here and defend myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| to say, well, is this where the straw ends or something like, okay, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| But I mean, I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| But as the property owner, I believe it's my right to get fair zoning, whether I use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| it or whether I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you, Commission, for at least letting me to get my stuff together for January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| And Mr. Wilson, would you be willing to meet with the community and also with planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I mean, I have to say that I wasn't thrilled with the decision that came out of Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| I felt like some design guidelines would have been nice to have or some sort of recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| suggestions of how to address this property, because I'm sure you're aware there are many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| sinkholes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| I mean, engineering, Robert Campbell and associates will be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| I have a concept plan, a couple of concept plans already designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| They do not believe that that's an issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| They can be worked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| The one in the front, they were making the detention pond out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| To me, a developed piece of property that's engineered, and that's what engineering is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| about, is the piece of property as it lays now for flooding and everything is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| But engineering should always help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| I mean, I thought that's what engineering did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| So if we're going to engineer to fix those things, and we follow the guidelines set by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| the engineers, and we follow the rules of inspections and everything, is that not what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| engineering is for and developing is for, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| I mean, as it lays now, yeah, it floods, well, you know, that's what we would fix, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| would do what we were told, you know, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Mr. Welch, would Planning Commission consider some sort of design guidelines that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| align this piece of property with the conservation overlay that's adjacent to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| That was not considered by the Commission or the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I mean, it is being zoned to a planned residential zone, so he will have to come back with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| concept to Planning Commission for further consideration for review by engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| planning and other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| So also the City of Knox will be having to look at it because the access is directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| on two city streets, so there should be plenty of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| I guess what I'm saying is I'm actually asking Planning Commission to take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| when you do have these conversations, as well as the Presbyterian Church across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| It's not on the National Register, but it is eligible, and I think that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| we should take into consideration, as well, and just kind of offer some design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| and then, you know, I would ask that maybe those are shared with the community and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| an ongoing conversation about this piece of property, and to your point, yes, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| we understand property rights, but we also understand that some of the things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| have done in the past and decisions we have made from a zoning and land use perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| have not bode well for communities in Knox County, and so I understand the argument of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| precedent, but we're here to change that, and we're going to really look at this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| hopefully work with the community and have better conversations, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-zoning?start=1539)|
