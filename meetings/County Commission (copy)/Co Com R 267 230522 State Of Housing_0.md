| 0:00:30| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=30.0)|
| 0:00:31| Thank you for joining us for a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=31.0)|
| 0:00:34| from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=34.0)|
| 0:00:37| specifically Hanson Sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=37.0)|
| 0:00:39| on the 2023 State of Housing Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=39.0)|
| 0:00:42| Mr. Sale, I will turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=42.0)|
| 0:00:48| Great, good to see all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=48.0)|
| 0:00:50| Hanson Sale, as most of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=50.0)|
| 0:00:52| So I'm going to just jump into the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=52.0)|
| 0:00:54| and get through the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=54.0)|
| 0:00:56| so we can have a conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=56.0)|
| 0:00:57| because I think it's a pretty big topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=57.0)|
| 0:01:02| So I'd like to start off these presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=62.0)|
| 0:01:04| just with where are we right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=64.0)|
| 0:01:08| The economy and the housing market are both cooling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=68.0)|
| 0:01:10| but it's important to note that Knoxville has seen a slowdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=70.0)|
| 0:01:14| in a much less significant way than the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=74.0)|
| 0:01:17| So when you look at other parts of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=77.0)|
| 0:01:19| we're holding pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=79.0)|
| 0:01:21| And I like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=81.0)|
| 0:01:22| do you remember that low home price advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=82.0)|
| 0:01:24| that we talk about when we recruit business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=84.0)|
| 0:01:27| To Knoxville, it's gone, and I'll show you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=87.0)|
| 0:01:30| And the pandemic provoked structural changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=90.0)|
| 0:01:33| in the housing market, and I will get into that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=93.0)|
| 0:01:36| So just looking, I like to start these off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=96.0)|
| 0:01:38| with some just general economic trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=98.0)|
| 0:01:41| because housing is the business cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=101.0)|
| 0:01:43| They're intimately related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=103.0)|
| 0:01:45| So just looking at our economy as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=105.0)|
| 0:01:47| this is showing real inflation-adjusted economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=107.0)|
| 0:01:51| So you can see in 2021 and 2022, we had very strong growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=111.0)|
| 0:01:55| And do note that in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=115.0)|
| 0:01:58| our economy grew at nearly twice the pace of the U.S. overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=118.0)|
| 0:02:02| So we are growing quickly in terms of economic output,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=122.0)|
| 0:02:06| and we are anticipating that we're going to see that slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=126.0)|
| 0:02:10| but stay relatively strong going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=130.0)|
| 0:02:15| Looking at employment, we hear a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=135.0)|
| 0:02:17| when we're talking about the labor shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=137.0)|
| 0:02:19| that people aren't going back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=139.0)|
| 0:02:21| It's not necessarily true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=141.0)|
| 0:02:23| Our employment base right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=143.0)|
| 0:02:25| total employment is up over 6% from pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=145.0)|
| 0:02:28| So our employment base is growing pretty dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=148.0)|
| 0:02:32| and has been for the better part of a year and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=152.0)|
| 0:02:36| But the one thing that we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=156.0)|
| 0:02:38| and this is in part because we're an aging population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=158.0)|
| 0:02:40| we're seeing retirees come to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=160.0)|
| 0:02:42| our labor force participation rate is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=162.0)|
| 0:02:45| But it's not something that is all that COVID-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=165.0)|
| 0:02:48| It's more of a long-term trend that's been happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=168.0)|
| 0:02:50| as you can see, really, since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=170.0)|
| 0:02:53| And this is another important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=173.0)|
| 0:02:55| because I talk a lot about the labor market in terms of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=175.0)|
| 0:02:59| because the labor market ultimately drives the housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=179.0)|
| 0:03:02| And so you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=182.0)|
| 0:03:04| our 65 and older share of our metro population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=184.0)|
| 0:03:07| is growing really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=187.0)|
| 0:03:09| and our prime-age working share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=189.0)|
| 0:03:11| those people that we are really trying to recruit to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=191.0)|
| 0:03:14| are declining as a share of our population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=194.0)|
| 0:03:16| which has some really big implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=196.0)|
| 0:03:18| for the labor market but also for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=198.0)|
| 0:03:22| So another thing that is a broader economic trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=202.0)|
| 0:03:26| that has really big impacts on the housing market is inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=206.0)|
| 0:03:30| As you can see here, this is the actual index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=210.0)|
| 0:03:34| that the Fed tracks for inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=214.0)|
| 0:03:36| We all see the CPI, but they don't actually follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=216.0)|
| 0:03:39| They follow core PCE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=219.0)|
| 0:03:41| What you can see is stripping out core PCE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=221.0)|
| 0:03:44| is stripping out some of the volatile energy, gas, food prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=224.0)|
| 0:03:49| And you can see inflation is moving sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=229.0)|
| 0:03:51| And so reading into these trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=231.0)|
| 0:03:55| it doesn't look great for mortgage rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=235.0)|
| 0:03:58| The idea that the Fed is going to start cutting rates this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=238.0)|
| 0:04:01| I think is a little far-fetched given what we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=241.0)|
| 0:04:04| and we really need to see a sustained decline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=244.0)|
| 0:04:06| not just a couple of months, but a sustained decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=246.0)|
| 0:04:09| And because of this, we've seen the strongest pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=249.0)|
| 0:04:12| of monetary policy tightening on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=252.0)|
| 0:04:16| which has provoked one of the fastest interest rate increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=256.0)|
| 0:04:21| mortgage rate increases, as you can see the orange line here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=261.0)|
| 0:04:24| bottoming out at like 2.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=264.0)|
| 0:04:27| I have a 2.75 rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=267.0)|
| 0:04:29| I'm never letting go of that sucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=269.0)|
| 0:04:31| It's well over 6 and has hovered that around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=271.0)|
| 0:04:35| which is, again, big implications for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=275.0)|
| 0:04:37| So getting into what is actually happening housing-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=277.0)|
| 0:04:40| what happened in 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=280.0)|
| 0:04:42| So home sales dropped 9% in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=282.0)|
| 0:04:46| which is the largest drop since the Great Recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=286.0)|
| 0:04:49| And it all happened in the third and fourth quarter of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=289.0)|
| 0:04:54| We're starting to turn things around, but it was a big drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=294.0)|
| 0:04:58| Home prices, however, have been pretty steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=298.0)|
| 0:05:01| You can see on the West Coast, if you read national news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=301.0)|
| 0:05:03| it looks like home prices are dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=303.0)|
| 0:05:05| Not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=305.0)|
| 0:05:07| We grew 16.7% in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=307.0)|
| 0:05:10| and we're already seeing some of the price growth come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=310.0)|
| 0:05:15| And you can see here in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=315.0)|
| 0:05:17| the Knoxville Metro was number six in the country for price growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=317.0)|
| 0:05:21| and we've outpaced the national average in every quarter since 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=321.0)|
| 0:05:26| So it's not a COVID trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=326.0)|
| 0:05:28| It's a long-term trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=328.0)|
| 0:05:30| Just looking at inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=330.0)|
| 0:05:31| this is showing you inventory for the MSA and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=331.0)|
| 0:05:34| It's really low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=334.0)|
| 0:05:36| We have seen a little bit of an uptick in inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=336.0)|
| 0:05:40| but it's still half of what it was pre-pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=340.0)|
| 0:05:44| and a third, a fourth of what it was in just 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=344.0)|
| 0:05:48| So, again, this is not a COVID trend per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=348.0)|
| 0:05:53| It is a long-term trend that we're seeing happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=353.0)|
| 0:05:56| that was definitely exacerbated by COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=356.0)|
| 0:06:00| And so looking at the regional listing price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=360.0)|
| 0:06:02| so this is just the median price of listings that are on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=362.0)|
| 0:06:06| so not sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=366.0)|
| 0:06:07| But you can see here, throughout all of our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=367.0)|
| 0:06:10| we've had a price premium in our housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=370.0)|

| 0:06:14| add on that we don't have a state income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=374.0)|
| 0:06:16| It's a really affordable place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=376.0)|
| 0:06:18| It's really great for remote workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=378.0)|
| 0:06:20| but it's great for business as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=380.0)|
| 0:06:22| But we've seen that change dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=382.0)|
| 0:06:25| So you see the national median listing price started to fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=385.0)|
| 0:06:28| mid-2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=388.0)|
| 0:06:30| Knoxville just kept on going, and as of April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=390.0)|
| 0:06:33| our median listing price was $50,000 higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=393.0)|
| 0:06:36| than the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=396.0)|
| 0:06:38| So, hey, we're that Knoxville affordable place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=398.0)|
| 0:06:41| In terms of home prices, it's just not true anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=401.0)|
| 0:06:44| which is something that I think is sad to see go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=404.0)|
| 0:06:47| but an important trend that we should be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=407.0)|
| 0:06:50| We hear a lot of conversation about investors' impact in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=410.0)|
| 0:06:56| You can see here, this is our analysis just for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=416.0)|
| 0:07:00| that shows about 14% of home sales in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=420.0)|
| 0:07:04| were investor purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=424.0)|
| 0:07:06| I will say this is probably the higher end of the spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=426.0)|
| 0:07:12| because we can't really tell the difference between an iBuyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=432.0)|
| 0:07:15| who actually puts the home back on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=435.0)|
| 0:07:18| so they're not taking away and renting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=438.0)|
| 0:07:20| But we've seen an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=440.0)|
| 0:07:22| but it's not a substantial increase to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=442.0)|
| 0:07:25| that does it have an overall market effect on our home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=445.0)|
| 0:07:30| I would argue no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=450.0)|
| 0:07:32| There is research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=452.0)|
| 0:07:33| Freddie Mac put out some research late last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=453.0)|
| 0:07:36| that said that they don't believe that investor purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=456.0)|
| 0:07:40| particularly institutional investor purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=460.0)|
| 0:07:42| had all that much of an impact on home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=462.0)|
| 0:07:45| And I will say the research that NAR has done on the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=465.0)|
| 0:07:49| says that investors tend to offer about the same amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=469.0)|
| 0:07:52| in terms of what their offer prices are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=472.0)|
| 0:07:55| and oftentimes a little bit lower than typical owner-occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=475.0)|
| 0:07:59| So, yes, they have some advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=479.0)|
| 0:08:02| in terms of being able to waive contingencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=482.0)|
| 0:08:05| things like that, cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=485.0)|
| 0:08:07| but do they offer substantially more for homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=487.0)|
| 0:08:10| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=490.0)|
| 0:08:12| So looking at the rental market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=492.0)|
| 0:08:14| again, also really, really substantial growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=494.0)|
| 0:08:18| So effective rents of just average rents in the Knoxville metro area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=498.0)|
| 0:08:22| are almost $450 higher than pre-pandemic levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=502.0)|
| 0:08:27| which is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=507.0)|
| 0:08:29| We have seen some of the fastest rent growth in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=509.0)|
| 0:08:32| We were number one for rent growth in the country in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=512.0)|
| 0:08:36| and we're staying in the top five as of the first quarter of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=516.0)|
| 0:08:41| So continuing to see rent growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=521.0)|
| 0:08:44| Looking at occupancy, this is kind of a funky graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=524.0)|
| 0:08:48| Focus on the blue bars here, which is occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=528.0)|
| 0:08:51| You can see our rental apartment occupancy rate rose almost to 99%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=531.0)|
| 0:08:58| which in effect is full, virtually completely full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=538.0)|
| 0:09:02| So not only are we seeing more expensive rental units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=542.0)|
| 0:09:06| but it's just increasingly hard to find one at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=546.0)|
| 0:09:09| And then to add on to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=549.0)|
| 0:09:11| finding a rental unit at all that's also affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=551.0)|
| 0:09:15| these trends are really coming together to make it hard for renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=555.0)|
| 0:09:18| But there is good news on the rental side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=558.0)|
| 0:09:20| Nearly 2,000 units are under construction right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=560.0)|
| 0:09:25| and slated to become available in the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=565.0)|
| 0:09:28| It's really, as you can see in this graph, very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=568.0)|
| 0:09:32| That's great news for renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=572.0)|
| 0:09:34| Will it provoke a decline in rent prices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=574.0)|
| 0:09:37| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=577.0)|
| 0:09:39| But will it keep rent growth lower than what we've seen in previous years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=579.0)|
| 0:09:44| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=584.0)|
| 0:09:45| Really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=585.0)|
| 0:09:46| It is very clustered in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=586.0)|
| 0:09:49| but we're starting to see it spread out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=589.0)|
| 0:09:51| particularly in some of our outlying parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=591.0)|
| 0:09:55| So looking at what does this all mean in terms of affordability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=595.0)|
| 0:09:59| So a couple of different indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=599.0)|
| 0:10:01| So this is a housing affordability index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=601.0)|
| 0:10:04| 100 means that the typical median household can qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=604.0)|
| 0:10:09| for the median priced home with a 10% down payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=609.0)|
| 0:10:12| By that measure, housing affordability is at its lowest level since the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=612.0)|
| 0:10:18| So very substantial decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=618.0)|
| 0:10:21| We were, as you can see, really in the post-2010 through 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=621.0)|
| 0:10:25| and really just until recently we've been relatively affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:29| But that drop in the post-COVID era is what has really weighed on our housing affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=629.0)|
| 0:10:36| So looking at it another way, this is just showing what do you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=636.0)|
| 0:10:40| what annual income do you need to purchase the median priced home in 2021 versus 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=640.0)|
| 0:10:46| We make some assumptions here, 10% down payment, 3% closing costs, so on and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=646.0)|
| 0:10:52| You need around $56,000 in 2021, and that rose all the way to almost $89,000 in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=652.0)|
| 0:11:03| And I don't know about you guys, I didn't get a $33,000 raise last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=663.0)|
| 0:11:08| and I suspect that most people didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=668.0)|
| 0:11:11| And so really, really big changes in the housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=671.0)|
| 0:11:15| Looking at another measure of affordability is not looking at can you afford the house that just sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=675.0)|
| 0:11:21| but what can you afford of the houses that are actively listed on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=681.0)|
| 0:11:27| So what you can see here is if you make less than $75,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=687.0)|
| 0:11:30| you can afford about 15% of active inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=690.0)|
| 0:11:34| So this is what I've been calling the triple threat of the housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=694.0)|
| 0:11:38| It's rising interest rates, high home prices compounded by low inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=698.0)|
| 0:11:43| that all come together to mean that two-thirds of the population can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=703.0)|
| 0:11:47| one-fifth of the active listings on any given day, which is really substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=707.0)|
| 0:11:54| $75,000 is well over our median and well over the starting salary for a teacher, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=714.0)|
| 0:12:03| And also, it's important to note that affordability overall has declined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=723.0)|
| 0:12:07| but it's been most dramatic for the entry-level price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=727.0)|
| 0:12:11| This is month's supply, which is a balanced, healthy market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=731.0)|
| 0:12:15| The industry standard is six months of supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=735.0)|
| 0:12:18| As you can see, we're really not meeting that in any circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=738.0)|
| 0:12:22| and we weren't pre-pandemic, but we really aren't now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=742.0)|
| 0:12:25| and that's particularly acute for the entry-level price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=745.0)|
| 0:12:29| Anybody who's out there buying and selling knows that it's really hard to find a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=749.0)|
| 0:12:32| under $300,000 in Knox County these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=752.0)|
| 0:12:37| So what are the challenges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=757.0)|
| 0:12:39| Underbuilding, rising costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=759.0)|
| 0:12:41| This is our estimate of the housing shortage for the metro area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:44| so this is not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=764.0)|
| 0:12:47| Obviously, a huge percentage of this shortage is in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=767.0)|
| 0:12:53| We don't do a particular estimate because of some limitations in the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=773.0)|
| 0:12:57| but basically what this is showing you is our estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=777.0)|
| 0:13:00| So we're looking at long-term trends, and this methodology is used by Freddie Mac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=780.0)|
| 0:13:06| It's used by Rosen Consulting Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=786.0)|
| 0:13:09| which is a really well-established housing consulting agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=789.0)|
| 0:13:14| It's just looking at if we want to maintain the affordability that we've had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=794.0)|
| 0:13:20| So if we thought that what we've had over the pre-2010 era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=800.0)|
| 0:13:26| that level of affordability is acceptable, and I would argue, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=806.0)|
| 0:13:30| We all brand ourselves as Knoxville, affordable place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=810.0)|
| 0:13:33| That should be the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=813.0)|
| 0:13:34| So using that standard and weighting it by how many households we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=814.0)|
| 0:13:38| and showing how many completions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=818.0)|
| 0:13:41| we've accrued somewhere between 22,000 and 25,000 housing units short of what we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=821.0)|
| 0:13:49| to maintain the level of affordability that we've been accustomed to in a long-term trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=829.0)|
| 0:13:55| I think it's important, too, just to add that that baseline period that we're using encompasses two business cycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=835.0)|
| 0:14:02| boom and bust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:04| It's a long-term average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=844.0)|
| 0:14:05| It's something that we can benchmark ourselves to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=845.0)|
| 0:14:07| And as you can see, we're just now getting back up to what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=847.0)|
| 0:14:11| but to start chipping away at that housing shortage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=851.0)|
| 0:14:13| we have to build over that orange line, and we're not even there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=853.0)|
| 0:14:18| And particularly important as well is that there's been a decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=858.0)|
| 0:14:22| in the lower price point new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=862.0)|
| 0:14:25| and none of this should be interpreted as a homebuilder's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=865.0)|
| 0:14:31| Homebuilders are doing everything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=871.0)|
| 0:14:34| We've put a lot of obstacles in their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=874.0)|
| 0:14:36| and then they're facing a lot of obstacles of not having labor, all kinds of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=876.0)|
| 0:14:41| and I'll show you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=881.0)|
| 0:14:43| But we definitely have seen a sustained trend in that low-level price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=883.0)|
| 0:14:48| We're not seeing it in new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=888.0)|
| 0:14:51| It's really declining in part because it's just not financially feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=891.0)|
| 0:14:55| in part because this is the change in price in different building materials since the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=895.0)|
| 0:15:00| So paint 31 percent, softwood lumber 28 percent, concrete 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=900.0)|
| 0:15:06| It's virtually impossible to build homes at the price point that we all would generally say is affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=906.0)|
| 0:15:15| given the density limitations that we currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=915.0)|
| 0:15:19| It's just not feasible, in part because land prices are growing really substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=919.0)|
| 0:15:24| So this is the AEI, the American Enterprise Institute, does these estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=924.0)|
| 0:15:30| Basically, it's an average value of a quarter-acre lot normalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=930.0)|
| 0:15:34| And so you can see $30,000, or we'll look at NOx, 29,000 in 2012, all the way up to 102,000 in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=934.0)|
| 0:15:46| So land is our most valuable commodity, and it's not a commodity because we can't get more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=946.0)|
| 0:15:53| And that is contributing to housing prices, in part because the average share of a home's value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=953.0)|
| 0:15:59| that is solely attributable to the land underneath it, which is sort of we dictate how much land is underneath your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=959.0)|
| 0:16:07| that's 44 percent of home prices as of 2021, up from 24 percent in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=967.0)|
| 0:16:15| So really, really substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=975.0)|
| 0:16:18| Another part of the long-term conversation is what we call the lock-in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=978.0)|
| 0:16:24| I think this is incredibly staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=984.0)|
| 0:16:27| Eight in ten homeowners with a mortgage in the state of Tennessee have a rate below 4 or 5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=987.0)|
| 0:16:36| which is a point and a half below the prevailing rate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=996.0)|
| 0:16:40| That's incredibly substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1000.0)|
| 0:16:43| This is not my joke, and it's slightly inappropriate, but the NAR economist, our chief economist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1003.0)|
| 0:16:49| said you might hate your wife, but you love your 2 percent interest rate a lot more, which is not totally true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1009.0)|
| 0:16:57| But it is a really big financial consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1017.0)|
| 0:17:00| I speak from my own perspective as a young person living in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1020.0)|
| 0:17:04| I can't afford the house that I live in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1024.0)|
| 0:17:06| My mortgage payment would be $1,000 more than what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1026.0)|
| 0:17:11| And that's going to have a substantial impact on people's decision to move and whether to list their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1031.0)|
| 0:17:18| and also, importantly, whether they list their homes or rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1038.0)|
| 0:17:22| If I'm moving, I'm going to hang on to that 275 rate and rent that sucker out and buy something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1042.0)|
| 0:17:29| And I think we're going to start seeing that more and more as people have virtually free money, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1049.0)|
| 0:17:35| in terms of a long-term mortgage rate that's well below the rate of inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1055.0)|
| 0:17:40| We're already seeing this in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1060.0)|
| 0:17:41| So you can see that big dark line is the number of new listings in the Knoxville metro area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1061.0)|
| 0:17:47| New listings are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1067.0)|
| 0:17:48| They hit the lowest level on record in December 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1068.0)|
| 0:17:52| And as you can see, in the early months of 2023, they're staying below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1072.0)|
| 0:17:57| in part because a substantial number of people have very low interest rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1077.0)|
| 0:18:02| and the prospect of trading out their interest rate for one that's double their current interest rate doesn't feel all that great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1082.0)|
| 0:18:09| And it's important just to hammer home the point that this is not something that ends tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1089.0)|
| 0:18:14| These are 30-year mortgages, and will we see interest rates at sub-3 in the next 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1094.0)|
| 0:18:22| It's not all that likely at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1102.0)|
| 0:18:25| And so this is something that's going to be a long-term trend that I think is important to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1105.0)|
| 0:18:30| So I also wanted to throw in here some of the homeownership disparities that show up in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1110.0)|
| 0:18:37| Something that's interesting, the white-black homeownership gap in the Knoxville metro area is 30 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1117.0)|
| 0:18:43| And what is interesting is that the black homeownership rate is lower than the state and national average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1123.0)|
| 0:18:52| and that is also true of every other minority group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1132.0)|
| 0:18:56| They're all lower than the state and national average in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1136.0)|
| 0:19:00| in part because we're generally a little bit more urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1140.0)|
| 0:19:04| and that tends to be the case, but our overall homeownership rate is higher than the state and national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1144.0)|
| 0:19:10| So there's significant disparities, and part of that is unequal access to mortgage credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1150.0)|
| 0:19:16| This is not necessarily discrimination per se, but it is institutioned not having credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1156.0)|
| 0:19:24| We're working on different strategies through Fannie Mae is now incorporating rent payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1164.0)|
| 0:19:32| which I think is going to be a really great thing for access to mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1172.0)|
| 0:19:35| But this is for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1175.0)|
| 0:19:38| Looking at denial rates, black and Hispanic borrowers are denied at twice the rate of white borrowers and Asian borrowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1178.0)|
| 0:19:45| So it is a big disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1185.0)|
| 0:19:49| The big important point, though, is how these disparities largely are born because of income disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1189.0)|
| 0:19:58| And what is really important to note is how affordability challenges limit access to high-opportunity areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1198.0)|
| 0:20:05| So I think you guys can all relate that some of the places where people most want to live when a new housing development is proposed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1205.0)|
| 0:20:13| is where it's most vigorously opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1213.0)|
| 0:20:17| You see it in rezoning after rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1217.0)|
| 0:20:20| That tends to be the case, but it has the effect of locking different people out of those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1220.0)|
| 0:20:25| the areas that are the highest-opportunity areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1225.0)|
| 0:20:28| There's really great research by a Harvard economist named Raj Chetty that basically shows that we can look at the zip code that you grew up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1228.0)|
| 0:20:35| and basically determine your lifetime earnings with reasonable accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1235.0)|
| 0:20:40| So it's not necessarily a racial thing so much as access to high-opportunity areas, social networks, social capital, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1240.0)|
| 0:20:50| What you see is that black borrowers are nearly twice as likely to purchase in a low-income area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1250.0)|
| 0:20:55| and a whopping 28% of mortgage applications from black applicants are in low-income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1255.0)|
| 0:21:02| whereas when you see in the white applicants, it's much more balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1262.0)|
| 0:21:06| You also see this show up in the Hispanic population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1266.0)|
| 0:21:09| The Asian population is sort of an outlier here where almost a quarter of their applications are in high-income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1269.0)|
| 0:21:17| So it's not strictly a racial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1277.0)|
| 0:21:19| It's more of an issue of access to different opportunity areas and where we build housing and where affordable housing is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1279.0)|
| 0:21:27| So we think, and based on our report, we believe that housing demand over the next decade is going to be strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1287.0)|
| 0:21:35| and here's a couple of points why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1295.0)|
| 0:21:37| So this is showing the distribution of our metro population by generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1297.0)|
| 0:21:42| And so what you can see is that big spike in millennials, and it's generally higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1302.0)|
| 0:21:47| Millennials are aging into their prime home buying year, so younger millennials are buying for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1307.0)|
| 0:21:53| Older millennials may be moving up, having kids, and now they're looking for an extra bedroom, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1313.0)|
| 0:22:01| And then you also see that the other largest living generation is the baby boomers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1321.0)|
| 0:22:06| who are getting close to retirement age, if not already in retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1326.0)|
| 0:22:10| who are also actively in the market trying to find a different type of home that might be more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1330.0)|
| 0:22:16| And particularly after COVID, the prospect of being in an assisted-living facility is just a little bit less desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1336.0)|
| 0:22:23| after what played out over the course of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1343.0)|
| 0:22:27| We're starting to see this trend of baby boomers downsizing, and there's not a lot of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1347.0)|
| 0:22:32| And what I like to point out is these two big home-buying populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1352.0)|
| 0:22:36| We predominantly in East Tennessee build three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1356.0)|
| 0:22:42| I would argue that young millennials can't afford and don't want a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1362.0)|
| 0:22:48| and that might also be the case for baby boomers who can't afford and don't want a big house with a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1368.0)|
| 0:22:55| And so it's also an issue of providing different types of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1375.0)|
| 0:22:59| but these demographic trends definitely show that we're going to continue to see people in the market buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1379.0)|
| 0:23:04| and this isn't even factoring in some of the other trends like declining household size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1384.0)|
| 0:23:10| Even if we stopped growing in terms of population today, our households are getting smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1390.0)|
| 0:23:16| and a large number of people are living on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1396.0)|
| 0:23:20| Baby boomers are actually the fastest-growing percentage of sole-person households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1400.0)|
| 0:23:25| So people are living on their own more often, which does a single person need a big house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1405.0)|
| 0:23:30| Is a big house affordable to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1410.0)|
| 0:23:32| But even if we stopped growing in population with a declining household size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1412.0)|
| 0:23:38| we're still going to need more housing units in terms of quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1418.0)|
| 0:23:42| We can start having a conversation about how many empty bedrooms exist in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1422.0)|
| 0:23:47| which is a very interesting point, but it doesn't necessarily get at what is the number of units we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1427.0)|
| 0:23:54| and a higher share of sole-person households has a really big impact on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1434.0)|
| 0:24:00| And also migration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1440.0)|
| 0:24:02| Obviously we've all heard that there are a lot of people moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1442.0)|
| 0:24:06| You hear California in the news quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1446.0)|
| 0:24:09| It is corroborated in the data, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1449.0)|
| 0:24:12| Californians don't represent the majority of people moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1452.0)|
| 0:24:15| The majority of people buying in our region are still local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1455.0)|
| 0:24:19| It's not a majority of out-of-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1459.0)|
| 0:24:21| But we are seeing and attracting people from California, from Chicago, New York, D.C., all kinds of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1461.0)|
| 0:24:28| and we've interestingly completely reversed our Nashville trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1468.0)|
| 0:24:32| Some emerging data that I think is fairly reliable is showing that the number one destination for renters leaving Nashville is Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1472.0)|
| 0:24:41| and that's a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1481.0)|
| 0:24:43| And we're also seeing in terms of homeownership that we're seeing more people come from Nashville to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1483.0)|
| 0:24:50| than are leaving Knoxville to go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1490.0)|
| 0:24:52| So we're starting to reverse some historic trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1492.0)|
| 0:24:55| But it's also important to know that regional population growth is almost exclusively being driven by migration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1495.0)|
| 0:25:02| More people have died than were born in the past two years in our metro area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1502.0)|
| 0:25:08| and so all of the population growth that we've seen is virtually by migration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1508.0)|
| 0:25:13| So what's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1513.0)|
| 0:25:15| The 2023 outlook, our forecast for the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1515.0)|
| 0:25:20| For 2023, you can see the final numbers for 21-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1520.0)|
| 0:25:25| We're used the average mortgage rate at 6.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1525.0)|
| 0:25:29| That's Freddie Mac's estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1529.0)|
| 0:25:31| But our estimate is that we're going to see home prices grow by 3% to 5% next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1531.0)|
| 0:25:36| I'm very proud of myself because our NAR chief economist put out a forecast specific to a couple of the top metros in the country for 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1536.0)|
| 0:25:48| and one of them was Knoxville, and he came up with the exact same number that I did two weeks before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1548.0)|
| 0:25:54| So I'm hoping that it's a reliable estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1554.0)|
| 0:25:57| But as we know, forecasting is not the easiest thing to do in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1557.0)|
| 0:26:01| We do think home sales are going to continue to decline before rebounding in 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1561.0)|
| 0:26:06| but we're in it for the long haul in terms of there's no inventory which is going to weigh on home sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1566.0)|
| 0:26:11| but then affordability in general is also going to weigh on home sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1571.0)|
| 0:26:15| So definitely going to see a decline there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1575.0)|
| 0:26:18| On the rental side, with as many rental units slated to become available, we do think that the occupancy rate is going to fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1578.0)|
| 0:26:28| 96.6% is still pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1588.0)|
| 0:26:31| 93% to 94% is what's considered healthy for a rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1591.0)|
| 0:26:36| And in part, this is going to continue to decline over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1596.0)|
| 0:26:40| 2,000 units probably aren't going to hit the market next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1600.0)|
| 0:26:44| in part because developers are still having a hard time getting dishwashers or doors or windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:51| There's a lot of delays going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1611.0)|
| 0:26:53| But we do think that rent growth, given the underlying demographic trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1613.0)|
| 0:26:57| given what we're seeing in occupancy rates, we'll see positive rent growth of around 4% in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1617.0)|
| 0:27:04| although that could vary depending on how quickly supply chain issues wane out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1624.0)|
| 0:27:09| So that's our forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1629.0)|
| 0:27:10| And to end on a last slide before we get to questions, and I know there's a number of people here to help answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1630.0)|
| 0:27:16| one thing, the takeaway that we and I come away from this report is that failing to invest in our housing supply today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1636.0)|
| 0:27:26| is ultimately going to be at the expense of our economic growth and prosperity tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1646.0)|
| 0:27:32| Housing is the business cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1652.0)|
| 0:27:36| If we want to continue to grow and if we want to support essential workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1656.0)|
| 0:27:41| the people who during the pandemic we acutely felt, police officers, first responders, paramedics, pharmacy techs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1661.0)|
| 0:27:51| school teachers, the people who keep our society and our economy going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1671.0)|
| 0:27:56| if we want to continue to support them, then we have to put our money where our mouth is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1676.0)|
| 0:28:01| because we can raise salaries all day and housing costs are going to continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1681.0)|
| 0:28:05| It's ultimately a supply problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1685.0)|
| 0:28:07| And so that is the big takeaway that I wanted to leave you with before we get to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1687.0)|
| 0:28:12| And I was on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1692.0)|
| 0:28:14| If you obviously can, you guys don't need this information, but I throw it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1694.0)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you for being willing and being here today to engage on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1698.0)|
| 0:28:22| I think it's important to have a bunch of different voices because ultimately we all have to live with the decisions we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1702.0)|
| 0:28:29| but we are amid the process at Vance Knox that is likely the most important thing we will do in the next decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1709.0)|
| 0:28:35| And decisions that you make today will have an indelible impact on people of all ages and the future of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1715.0)|
| 0:28:44| And I think it's important to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1724.0)|
| 0:28:46| So thank you and I'm excited to have a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1726.0)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, Hanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1731.0)|
| 0:28:53| Commissioner Jay, are your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1733.0)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1735.0)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you for another great housing report and lots of data to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1736.0)|
| 0:29:00| Some new stuff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1740.0)|
| 0:29:02| It's really interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1742.0)|
| 0:29:04| Back on slide 12, you talked about the housing inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1744.0)|
| 0:29:10| Do you have any data on that's just-in-time inventory, but how often things turn over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1750.0)|
| 0:29:21| I mean, single family homes, condos, suburbs, urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1761.0)|
| 0:29:26| I mean, some of that available inventory could potentially free up if it gets out of the freeze zone or your frozen sort of section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1766.0)|
| 0:29:36| But do you have a sense of what turns over when and how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1776.0)|
| 0:29:41| And ultimately what I'm getting to is are there policies that-for instance, you talked about the one person in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1781.0)|
| 0:29:50| My neighbor is one person in a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1790.0)|
| 0:29:54| She's in the baby boomer or even older generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1794.0)|
| 0:30:02| There are no condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1802.0)|
| 0:30:04| She would love to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1804.0)|
| 0:30:05| No maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1805.0)|
| 0:30:06| There's nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1806.0)|
| 0:30:07| So do you have a sense of the turnover rates and what policies might accelerate those to open up more inventory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1807.0)|
| 0:30:14| That's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1814.0)|
| 0:30:16| We don't have great data on turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1816.0)|
| 0:30:18| So we do have like a high-level statistic that is just the average number of years that people stay in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1818.0)|
| 0:30:26| And Knoxville is actually one of the lowest in the country in terms of people are-the average number of years people stay in their house is actually really low in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1826.0)|
| 0:30:36| I think it's sort of a deceiving statistic because we've had so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1836.0)|
| 0:30:40| We're a high migration hotspot where people who are moving in are artificially bringing that number down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1840.0)|
| 0:30:48| In terms of turnover, it's just hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1848.0)|
| 0:30:51| We don't have great data on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1851.0)|
| 0:30:52| I wish we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1852.0)|
| 0:30:53| It's a really interesting question, but there's not a lot of great data on that point in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1853.0)|
| 0:30:58| What do you know about renters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1858.0)|
| 0:31:00| I mean, that has grown exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1860.0)|
| 0:31:04| Of course, the amount of rent has, too, the occupancy rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1864.0)|
| 0:31:08| We're sort of becoming a renter place more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1868.0)|
| 0:31:12| But what motivates them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1872.0)|
| 0:31:14| What do we know about how that changes population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1874.0)|
| 0:31:18| I mean, today, in today's Compass, there was a significant article about just the amount of population growth that has happened so quickly that I think all of us were kind of caught off-not off guard, but we're like continuously impressed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1878.0)|
| 0:31:32| So what does that tell you about the rental market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1892.0)|
| 0:31:34| The rental market is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1894.0)|
| 0:31:36| There's actually some really good survey data on Knoxville renters in particular just looking at average income, and we've seen over the past five years that more high-income households are choosing to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1896.0)|
| 0:31:47| So historically speaking, the average renter income has been fairly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1907.0)|
| 0:31:52| So it's been, in Knoxville in particular, has been lower-income residents, but it's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1912.0)|
| 0:31:59| So more high-income households are choosing to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1919.0)|
| 0:32:02| And so it's people who are just merely choosing to rent, whether they own investment properties, I don't know, but they're choosing to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1922.0)|
| 0:32:09| We're also seeing that average age grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1929.0)|
| 0:32:12| So people later in life are choosing to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1932.0)|
| 0:32:15| So the big shift in our rental market in particular is that higher-income households are choosing to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1935.0)|
| 0:32:22| And alternatively, we're also seeing migration from areas where it's more common to rent and the hassles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1942.0)|
| 0:32:30| And some people think that owning a home is a hassle, particularly if you're from a big city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1950.0)|
| 0:32:35| And as we attract more people from big cities, we're just naturally going to see our rental rate rise, generally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1955.0)|
| 0:32:42| But we do have a really shifting rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1962.0)|
| 0:32:45| Lastly, we're also seeing typically the student housing market is really different from the rest of the rental market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1965.0)|
| 0:32:55| to the extent that you rent out bedrooms in the student market as opposed to entire units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1975.0)|
| 0:33:02| We're seeing a lot more students seep into the private rental market, particularly downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1982.0)|
| 0:33:07| Obviously, that is related to students not being able to find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1987.0)|
| 0:33:13| Will that continue to be the case as we see more student housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1993.0)|
| 0:33:17| It's conceivably yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1997.0)|
| 0:33:20| But we're definitely seeing a shift in terms of students seeping into what would be traditionally considered the private rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2000.0)|
| 0:33:29| I have a couple other questions, but I'll yield for a while and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2009.0)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2013.0)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Fraser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2014.0)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2016.0)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, Hanson, for a great report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2017.0)|
| 0:33:41| Just some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2021.0)|
| 0:33:42| We talk frequently about this because we're both kind of data nerds and we do this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2022.0)|
| 0:33:47| But first, for the public who maybe is watching and our constituents, tell us a little bit about your position and your role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2027.0)|
| 0:33:55| and then also where the funding for your position comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2035.0)|
| 0:33:59| Yeah, the funding for my position comes from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2039.0)|
| 0:34:03| We're a nonpartisan trade association and represent just over 6,000 realtors across 12 counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2043.0)|
| 0:34:11| So I'm employed by the realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2051.0)|
| 0:34:14| And part of my job is advocacy to support home ownership, to support housing, the real estate industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2054.0)|
| 0:34:23| These reports, we take great care in making sure that they're as objective as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2063.0)|
| 0:34:29| And so that's summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2069.0)|
| 0:34:34| That's exactly what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2074.0)|
| 0:34:35| I mean, a lot of people are like, Hanson's sale, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2075.0)|
| 0:34:37| What does he do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2077.0)|
| 0:34:38| Who does he work for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2078.0)|
| 0:34:40| We get these questions a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2080.0)|
| 0:34:41| So I just thought, you know what, this is a good opportunity for you to just kind of explain that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2081.0)|
| 0:34:46| And then, you know, we've talked about, we kind of have this conversation on loop about underbuilding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2086.0)|
| 0:34:53| And so one question you and I have talked about, I've talked with Director Brooks and the county too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2093.0)|
| 0:34:58| is that, you know, realistically, what are the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2098.0)|
| 0:35:01| How many units do we have that have been approved and are in the pipeline but yet not constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2101.0)|
| 0:35:10| Because I think that's an important piece of information for us also to consider in the conversation of we tend to be underbuilding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2110.0)|
| 0:35:18| And I know that they did a great development activity report for 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2118.0)|
| 0:35:23| and it kind of shows that, you know, residential building permits for 2022, about 4,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2123.0)|
| 0:35:29| We had right at 690 rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2129.0)|
| 0:35:34| We have approximately 1,300 new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2134.0)|
| 0:35:39| And then going into, that's about 689 acres that was rezoned to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2139.0)|
| 0:35:46| And then total units, about 4,371.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2146.0)|
| 0:35:50| Director Brooks, is that about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2150.0)|
| 0:35:52| Are those units that have been approved and have yet to be constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2152.0)|
| 0:35:58| Do you have that answer, Hanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2158.0)|
| 0:36:01| I will defer to Amy on the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2161.0)|
| 0:36:09| It's the development activity report for 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2169.0)|
| 0:36:13| It's got a lot of great information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2173.0)|
| 0:36:15| Yes, thank you, Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2175.0)|
| 0:36:16| I would recommend that you all take a look at that development activity report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2176.0)|
| 0:36:20| The data is current as of December 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2180.0)|
| 0:36:25| So this is all included in that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2185.0)|
| 0:36:28| So residential building permits that had been approved for Knox County were 2,481.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2188.0)|
| 0:36:36| 2022 subdivisions, there were 1,216 approved lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2196.0)|
| 0:36:41| I don't have the data related to the rezonings at my fingertips right now, but it's in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2201.0)|
| 0:36:46| It's just great information, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2206.0)|
| 0:36:48| I just wanted to point that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2208.0)|
| 0:36:50| And, you know, Hanson, you know how this conversation people tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2210.0)|
| 0:36:53| we don't want this to become, we don't want Knox County to become Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2213.0)|
| 0:36:56| And there's a lot of factors in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2216.0)|
| 0:37:01| Do you think we're doing anything to prevent that, or do you have any recommendations to prevent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2221.0)|
| 0:37:07| as far as, you know, really preserving the landscape of what makes Knox County really beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2227.0)|
| 0:37:14| and attractive to people moving into the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2234.0)|
| 0:37:17| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2237.0)|
| 0:37:18| Well, I would argue that we are absolutely doing something about that in the form of advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2238.0)|
| 0:37:25| It's something that's been deferred for far too long, and the planning process is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2245.0)|
| 0:37:31| You know, I think the thing that we could do to not, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2251.0)|
| 0:37:36| if we want to, I mean, Nashville is busy and unaffordable, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2256.0)|
| 0:37:40| we also hear, like, we don't want to become California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2260.0)|
| 0:37:43| Well, in the 1980s, California used to be zoned all multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2263.0)|
| 0:37:48| They cut their density by 80 percent, and now, you know, 40 years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2268.0)|
| 0:37:54| they're starting to get rid of single-family zoning because they recognize that they swung too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2274.0)|
| 0:38:01| And so it's finding a balance, obviously, and I think advanced Knox is the avenue by which we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2281.0)|
| 0:38:06| And, you know, I think that is a, quite honestly, I don't think the Nashville comparison is a great example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2286.0)|
| 0:38:13| only because we aren't Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2293.0)|
| 0:38:16| We're never going to be Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2296.0)|
| 0:38:18| But we do have to grapple with the fact of, you know, if we continue to build, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2298.0)|
| 0:38:25| as at current levels, we're not going to be the really affordable East Tennessee city that we've always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2305.0)|
| 0:38:33| and change is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2313.0)|
| 0:38:35| So how do we do it in a good way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2315.0)|
| 0:38:37| And I would argue that advanced Knox is really critical to that and why I truly believe it will be Mayor Jacobs' legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2317.0)|
| 0:38:43| and the most important thing that this commission does and this county does in the next decade, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2323.0)|
| 0:38:50| You talked about the uptick in apartment homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2330.0)|
| 0:38:54| Do you see a direct correlation with that impacting homeownership of residents here that have been here for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2334.0)|
| 0:39:02| and it's kind of cutting them out or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2342.0)|
| 0:39:05| You see more of a shift of people holding on to single-family homes and renting them and then moving to apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2345.0)|
| 0:39:14| It's not really crowding people out of the homeownership market, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2354.0)|
| 0:39:21| There's huge demand for single-family rentals, which is sort of an under-acknowledged thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2361.0)|
| 0:39:28| is that if people didn't want to rent single-family homes, then we wouldn't see this trend of more rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2368.0)|
| 0:39:35| in the single-family home market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2375.0)|
| 0:39:36| It's something that's desirable for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2376.0)|
| 0:39:38| But I don't think it's necessarily a direct correlation so much as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2378.0)|
| 0:39:43| our homeownership rate has actually been fairly flat, all things considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2383.0)|
| 0:39:48| I mean, it's going to vary just based off of population weighting and things like that from the Census Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2388.0)|
| 0:39:53| But I would argue it's been pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2393.0)|
| 0:39:55| And I'm not sure that the increase in apartment units are directly having much of an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2395.0)|
| 0:40:02| on people's decision to rent or own, given the tradeoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2402.0)|
| 0:40:08| So we know UT is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2408.0)|
| 0:40:11| They just announced, you know, another growth idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2411.0)|
| 0:40:16| What kind of impact is that having on housing in the county and the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2416.0)|
| 0:40:23| They continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2423.0)|
| 0:40:25| Those students have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2425.0)|
| 0:40:27| We're seeing students then and families of students purchasing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2427.0)|
| 0:40:33| really kind of outbidding local residents from homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2433.0)|
| 0:40:39| Is there any correlation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2439.0)|
| 0:40:40| Are they a part of the projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2440.0)|
| 0:40:42| Are they a part of the conversation about the housing shortage that we seem to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2442.0)|
| 0:40:47| and the part that they play in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2447.0)|
| 0:40:50| I can't stand up here and honestly say that they're not having an impact on the competition in our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2450.0)|
| 0:40:58| They absolutely are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2458.0)|
| 0:41:01| But I think it's hard to isolate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2461.0)|
| 0:41:05| I mean, it's also provoked a huge increase in housing supply in terms of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2465.0)|
| 0:41:09| But it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2469.0)|
| 0:41:10| I mean, I live in a neighborhood where half of my neighborhood is employed by the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2470.0)|
| 0:41:15| And so the impact of students on housing costs, it has to have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2475.0)|
| 0:41:21| The sheer quantity has an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2481.0)|
| 0:41:24| But how do you weigh that against UT employees who frequent local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2484.0)|
| 0:41:30| and the substantial portion of our economy that you can attribute to the university?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2490.0)|
| 0:41:35| I mean, they're definitely having an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2495.0)|
| 0:41:37| Is it a conversation we need to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2497.0)|
| 0:41:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2499.0)|
| 0:41:41| Do I have the perfect answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2501.0)|
| 0:41:44| Probably not because this is an issue that I think we have to have more government, private, and university involvement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2504.0)|
| 0:41:52| We have not engaged this conversation in a meaningful way, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2512.0)|
| 0:41:56| But it's certainly having an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2516.0)|
| 0:41:59| It's just how do you weigh the costs and benefits of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2519.0)|
| 0:42:03| And then what does the future of mortgage lending look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2523.0)|
| 0:42:06| Very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2526.0)|
| 0:42:08| That's a big question that I think if I had a great answer to, I would be paid a lot more and probably not live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2528.0)|
| 0:42:15| But I think we're going to continue to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2535.0)|
| 0:42:19| I mean, the 30-year mortgage is unique globally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2539.0)|
| 0:42:24| Most countries in the world don't have 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2544.0)|
| 0:42:31| They don't have easy access to long-term lending to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2551.0)|
| 0:42:37| So I'm not sure that things are going to change that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2557.0)|
| 0:42:40| You're starting to see rate buy-downs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2560.0)|
| 0:42:43| I think that's going to continue to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2563.0)|
| 0:42:46| But what's really fundamentally important is that the Dodd-Frank and regulations coming out of 2008 have fundamentally changed our lending process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2566.0)|
| 0:42:55| So the people who are getting loans are overqualified and have higher credit scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2575.0)|
| 0:43:01| They have to prove what they have in their bank accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2581.0)|
| 0:43:05| The future of lending is much more staple than it was 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2585.0)|
| 0:43:11| And it's in part why if we were in a housing collapse, we would see people listing their houses for sale and at a price premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2591.0)|
| 0:43:19| But homeowners aren't accepting lower home prices right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2599.0)|
| 0:43:23| So I think it's important to note that if we were in sort of a shift, I think we would see more houses on the market at a lower price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2603.0)|
| 0:43:30| But we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2610.0)|
| 0:43:31| So don't have a totally amazing answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2611.0)|
| 0:43:35| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2615.0)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2616.0)|
| 0:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2618.0)|
| 0:43:40| Thank you, Hanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2620.0)|
| 0:43:41| You've done very thorough in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2621.0)|
| 0:43:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2623.0)|
| 0:43:45| One of your charts says that the median sale price in a house last year was $315,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2625.0)|
| 0:43:52| So is that the magic number for an affordable house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2632.0)|
| 0:43:56| How do you – what is an affordable house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2636.0)|
| 0:43:59| Well, I think that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2639.0)|
| 0:44:01| And so it's looking at – I think affordability is sort of a shifting target because it's not one factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2641.0)|
| 0:44:08| I mean, 350 – I mean, it's all about what kind of jobs we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2648.0)|
| 0:44:14| If we have higher income jobs and we're seeing incomes grow, then a higher price point might be more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2654.0)|
| 0:44:21| But what I would say is that when we start looking at what's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2661.0)|
| 0:44:24| I mean, and it also shifts based off of mortgage rates, which are cyclical and no one can really predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2664.0)|
| 0:44:30| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2670.0)|
| 0:44:31| Today, what is an affordable house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2671.0)|
| 0:44:34| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2674.0)|
| 0:44:36| I would argue that at our current interest mortgage rates, it's probably sub-300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2676.0)|
| 0:44:42| Sub-300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2682.0)|
| 0:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2683.0)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2685.0)|
| 0:44:46| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2686.0)|
| 0:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2688.0)|
| 0:44:49| You said something about the minority population, like how can we increase the access and opportunity to become homeowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2689.0)|
| 0:44:57| Yeah, a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2697.0)|
| 0:44:58| In your research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2698.0)|
| 0:44:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2699.0)|
| 0:45:00| Yeah, well, I think it's a really important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2700.0)|
| 0:45:03| Part of it is engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2703.0)|
| 0:45:05| There's a lot of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2705.0)|
| 0:45:07| It's really – I hate the answer of education because I think that's what we always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2707.0)|
| 0:45:13| But it really is an important and very critical part of this because a lot of it is misnomers about what it requires to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2713.0)|
| 0:45:20| I spoke with Commissioner Jay not long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2720.0)|
| 0:45:24| He was, like, staggered at me showing what a 5% down payment, like, affordability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2724.0)|
| 0:45:30| And that's standard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2730.0)|
| 0:45:32| Five and 3% isn't really uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2732.0)|
| 0:45:36| And so breaking down the barriers of thinking that you need 20% down to purchase a home is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2736.0)|
| 0:45:43| And also utilizing some of these features that we have in mortgage lending that aren't necessarily standard, but rent reporting, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2743.0)|
| 0:45:51| You can report your rent payments, and that can build credit history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2751.0)|
| 0:45:56| You don't have to have a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2756.0)|
| 0:45:58| You can just show that you've paid your rent for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2758.0)|
| 0:46:01| So there's a lot of these programs that I think we as a community could really embrace in terms of even in our public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2761.0)|
| 0:46:08| I'm not – I would love to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2768.0)|
| 0:46:10| I don't have an answer for it, but I would love to hear from KCDC with our subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2770.0)|
| 0:46:16| Are we reporting that our tenants, when they have positive rent history, are we reporting that to credit agencies to help build credit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2776.0)|
| 0:46:25| There's a litany of different things we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2785.0)|
| 0:46:27| It just sort of takes a focused effort on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2787.0)|
| 0:46:30| And it's a really big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2790.0)|
| 0:46:33| Are there any organizations that hold the education, the tools to get that access that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2793.0)|
| 0:46:42| I'm inevitably going to miss one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2802.0)|

| 0:47:02| I think some additional funding is always helpful in those terms of outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2822.0)|

| 0:47:40| especially going through budget season now, talking about cop and teacher pay and employee pay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2860.0)|
| 0:47:46| And one of the things that stuck out to me was the joke about you didn't get a $30,000 raise last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2866.0)|
| 0:47:54| And then I'm reading through this, and the median price of a new home is $417,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2874.0)|
| 0:48:01| And then you need to make $120,000 to be able to afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2881.0)|
| 0:48:06| I don't know many people that work for county government that makes anywhere close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2886.0)|
| 0:48:12| So one of the big things that you also had in there was we're short $22,000, $25,000 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2892.0)|
| 0:48:20| or 25,000 units, housing units for people to live in, and that we're getting close to building at the demand rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2900.0)|
| 0:48:29| We're just below the demand rate, and we have to build above the demand rate just to eat into that $22,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2909.0)|
| 0:48:34| So if we're doing somewhere around, I think the Commissioner said around, was it 2,000 right now units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2914.0)|
| 0:48:43| What did you say earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2923.0)|
| 0:48:46| What are the houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2926.0)|
| 0:48:47| How many houses are we building right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2927.0)|
| 0:48:49| Permits that we're issuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2929.0)|
| 0:48:51| We're doing 4,000 a year, so we need to be probably closer to 5,000 or 6,000 a year just to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2931.0)|
| 0:48:57| and then probably dig into that $22,000 that we're short in, $25,000 that we're short in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2937.0)|
| 0:49:03| Does that sound accurate to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2943.0)|
| 0:49:05| I can follow up with a more precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2945.0)|
| 0:49:08| Our estimate is for the metro area, so it encompasses surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2948.0)|
| 0:49:12| But it is higher than what we, I mean, it's important to weight these things by households because we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2952.0)|
| 0:49:20| oh, we're building this much percentage more, but it has to be, I mean, it's all relative to the size of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2960.0)|
| 0:49:27| So we're barely kind of getting back to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2967.0)|
| 0:49:31| And to your point, some of our research that we haven't put out yet, looking at teacher salaries, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2971.0)|
| 0:49:37| the share of listings that are affordable to a starting teacher with a master's degree is, I'll tease, below 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2977.0)|
| 0:49:46| So it's substantial, and I would, you know, I think it's not just the salary question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2986.0)|
| 0:49:53| It's how do we control housing costs and ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2993.0)|
| 0:49:56| I mean, housing is supply and demand, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2996.0)|
| 0:49:58| I mean, all economics at its core is usually supply and demand of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2998.0)|
| 0:50:03| I mean, for us, Jesse, you wrote a great article I read this morning as well that, you know, we had over 7,000 new people come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3003.0)|
| 0:50:09| That's a good amount of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3009.0)|
| 0:50:11| And all those people need houses, and that just adds to, you know, and because people can't afford houses now, they're renting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3011.0)|
| 0:50:18| There's not enough houses, so they're renting because you have on here only 15% of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3018.0)|
| 0:50:25| You know, if 75,000 gets you 15%, that's not a lot of houses that are left for everybody left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3025.0)|
| 0:50:30| Well, and I think it's important to acknowledge that it is a supply and demand thing, but unlike most markets, we don't allow – we fix supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3030.0)|
| 0:50:42| You know, if frosted flakes get really popular, you know, Kellogg is going to start producing a lot more frosted flakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3042.0)|
| 0:50:51| That's not really possible in the housing market in part because we regulate land use, and we do – you know, land use is an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3051.0)|
| 0:50:58| We have to regulate it, but it's – you know, we also prohibit, you know, the builders' and developers' ability to respond to supply in a dynamic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3058.0)|
| 0:51:09| So it's not this equal market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3069.0)|
| 0:51:11| We have to acknowledge the government side of we are literally regulating the extent to which we can respond supply-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3071.0)|
| 0:51:20| To some extent, that is always, I mean, a necessary thing, but it's important just to – we sort of put our hammer down on the supply-demand thing because, you know, in many ways, regulations actually control and manipulate the supply-demand relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3080.0)|
| 0:51:39| I agree 100% there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3099.0)|
| 0:51:41| I also like the point that, you know, I used to be able to buy a new lot to build, a quarter-acre lot for $15,000,000, $20,000,000 when I first started building here a decade ago, and now it's easily $50,000,000, $75,000,000 just to get a lot, just to build a house on, which then has to go in the carry costs and interest rates and everything else goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3101.0)|
| 0:52:00| So it's – I don't – I was talking to Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3120.0)|
| 0:52:05| You know, the $450,000 house I used to build now goes for $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3125.0)|
| 0:52:09| It's the same house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3129.0)|
| 0:52:11| The blueprints have been changed one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3131.0)|
| 0:52:13| It's the same house I built five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3133.0)|
| 0:52:15| I'm building it today, but they're now worth almost double as much, and I know my wife – you know, I said this last week, but the house I used to own, you know, we were in it for five years, and five years, it doubled in price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3135.0)|
| 0:52:27| The house that I've owned now for two years has gone up 25% in price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3147.0)|
| 0:52:31| And I don't know – I don't see anybody getting, you know, 25% pay increases year over year to be able to afford to live at this standard, and I feel bad for the younger generation and my children that can they afford to live in Knoxville if we don't do something or build quicker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3151.0)|
| 0:52:49| I'm not quite sure there's a singular answer to this problem, but it's going to – how do you stop becoming Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3169.0)|
| 0:52:55| You know, I think we're going to be Franklin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3175.0)|
| 0:52:58| We're going to be very, very expensive to live, and we're not building at high-density rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3178.0)|
| 0:53:02| You're just going to have a lot of really expensive houses that people can't afford to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3182.0)|
| 0:53:08| So I really appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3188.0)|
| 0:53:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3190.0)|
| 0:53:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3191.0)|
| 0:53:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3192.0)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3193.0)|
| 0:53:14| One of our neighboring counties put a moratorium on a certain type of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3194.0)|
| 0:53:20| What kind of impact has that had on Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3200.0)|
| 0:53:24| You know, I have argued and I have been thankful for the support of Mayor Jacobs, and I think that Knox County has – it has a substantial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3204.0)|
| 0:53:38| Blount County, to name one, is attracting Amazon and Smith & Wesson, and then trying to reduce their residential density by 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3218.0)|
| 0:53:49| They actually succeeded in that just last week, and they also temporarily stopped cluster development, which is a form of plant-pud development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3229.0)|
| 0:53:59| So it has a substantial impact, and it's in part because it's more expensive to live in Blount County than Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3239.0)|
| 0:54:05| So all of the jobs that are being attracted to Blount County, a substantial portion of those people are commuting from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3245.0)|
| 0:54:11| and I think there's some good data on that from the Knoxville-Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3251.0)|
| 0:54:16| But it's also, you know, we're not picking up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3256.0)|
| 0:54:19| I mean, it's more substantial than what some of the data that Census is putting out reflects, in part just from the lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3259.0)|
| 0:54:25| But it's huge, and we're also seeing it in Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3265.0)|
| 0:54:28| We're seeing it in Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3268.0)|
| 0:54:30| You know, in many ways, the political boundary is fairly arbitrary, and a market doesn't really care where the political boundary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3270.0)|
| 0:54:41| It's one market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3281.0)|
| 0:54:43| So it has a really substantial impact, and the extent to which we have a regional conversation, I think, is incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3283.0)|
| 0:54:50| But we have the days of nine counties, one vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3290.0)|
| 0:54:54| The concept of planning at a regional level is, you know, look, we all just had a conversation about splitting up our own regional planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3294.0)|
| 0:55:04| We're moving away from that, and, you know, unfortunately, the market, we're all one market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3304.0)|
| 0:55:09| So it has a substantial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3309.0)|
| 0:55:15| Commissioner Jay, to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3315.0)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3317.0)|
| 0:55:19| Perfect segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3319.0)|
| 0:55:20| Mike Odom is here from the Chamber, and as we talk about workforce and attracted businesses, jobs, and how this has a total impact on our economic prosperity, this is your world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3320.0)|
| 0:55:35| Could you tell us what you're seeing and how the data shared today translates into your ability to both attract, retain, or grow our workforce here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3335.0)|
| 0:55:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3345.0)|
| 0:55:46| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3346.0)|
| 0:55:47| I usually get criticized for the negativity of my presentations, but I look like sunshine and rainbows next to Hanson, so I appreciate him doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3347.0)|
| 0:55:56| Everything that you just saw is having a significant impact on our ability to draw new businesses here, to retain talent, and to draw talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3356.0)|
| 0:56:08| It is the number one issue we have right now from businesses we hear that says, I want to hire people, but there's nowhere for them to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3368.0)|
| 0:56:16| I'm trying to attract the talent we want to, you know, Hanson brought up the slide that talked about economic growth and prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3376.0)|
| 0:56:24| We're trying to get these people to give them better jobs so that they can have more economic growth, they can have more prosperity, and then there's nowhere there for them to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3384.0)|
| 0:56:33| Anecdotally, we started seeing, we're hearing from students now who are moving further and further away from campus, so we're wondering, is that impacting our traffic ingestion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3393.0)|
| 0:56:44| And so those are the types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3404.0)|
| 0:56:46| We're actually in this fiscal year business plan, we're lessening our business attraction, which is the kind of external out of town marketing and focusing more on expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3406.0)|
| 0:57:00| because we just have nowhere for those folks to live if they come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3420.0)|
| 0:57:03| So it's a huge impact on our business and our ability to do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3423.0)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you very much. And Hanson, will this be published in a way in which the public can consume it all if they wish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3429.0)|
| 0:57:15| It is up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3435.0)|
| 0:57:17| Okay, so it's on the website now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3437.0)|
| 0:57:19| You can download it, a PDF copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3439.0)|
| 0:57:21| Awesome. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3441.0)|
| 0:57:23| Thank you, Hanson, for this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3443.0)|
| 0:57:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3445.0)|
