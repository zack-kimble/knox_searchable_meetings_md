| 2:28:23| I guess I'd like to see if I could hear from someone from the county regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| what's happened with the code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| If someone's come out and looked at it, if they measured the decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| where we are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Yes, we have a long history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| On the original approval in May of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| there were some conditions about the hours the lights could be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8924)|
| 2:28:51| When there were no guests there, the lights couldn't be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| When they came back in June of 2020 for a subsequent approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| those conditions didn't get on to that use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| It was our interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| We could only enforce the conditions of the June 2020 approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| Ms. Rivetti appealed that to us to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| BZA agreed with us that you couldn't go back to subsequent use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| We were only enforcing what was in the 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| So we were left to enforce what was in the June approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| and what we have in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| which is very vague enough for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| So why was the original conditions not carried over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| Was there a reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| Were they supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| They weren't supposed to be carried over from May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| I think it's time we finally have some clarification on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| If we don't have rules, this will be just chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| Commissioner Midas, if you would like to ask a question to someone, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| I was wanting Mr. Elgin to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| So we have to enforce the latest use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| which was, I believe, June of 2020 and the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| We feel as though we're there complying with that June approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| and the zoning ordinance at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| And we have sent inspectors out multiple times at night to check that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9018)|
| 2:30:25| to ensure, and we've never noted a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| So the noise that the other residents are complaining about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| are those coming from other houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| Is that what the officers are thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| We didn't do the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| We only did the lighting, compliance with the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| They don't post a schedule online for us to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| so it's been hard for my staff to make it out there when they are having an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| The events they do post, they'll have a brunch on Sunday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9050)|
| 2:30:55| something like that, but the weddings that are private parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| they don't post those or share those online, so it's hard for my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| I can't send a staff member out there every Saturday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| to see if they're having a wedding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| It's been difficult for us to make it out to enforce the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| So the Sheriff's Department doesn't go out at night if there was a call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| And can they not measure at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| No, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| I think it's been relayed to us that they didn't note violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| but I would defer to what they've told the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| They frequently tell us they have no idea what rule retreat regulations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| so we show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| Let me explain the rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Once it gets to the commission floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| unless we specifically address either applicant or opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| then it stays on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| I'm sorry, these are the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| I'm not picking on any one individual, but those are the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9106)|
| 2:31:55| Ms. McGee, can you talk a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| I know there's not that many residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| but how many events do you have on the weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| What's your occupancy for right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| It just depends on the time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9127)|
| 2:32:08| Obviously in hospitality and an event situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| it depends on the time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| We can have a private event on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| Typically we only have one, maybe two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| If we have a lunch on a Saturday, an event on a Saturday night, like a wedding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| And then we would have like a Sunday brunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| I actually have decibel readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| I actually have the rule retreat ordinance, if you'd like me to read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| that was approved, just to educate, if you'd like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| I'll be glad to give that to you and give you the decibel readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| and show you the lighting that we are talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| if that would help answer anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| There has not been any violations, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Anytime that we have contacted the police for the gun shooting or the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9168)|
| 2:32:55| Now, I'm not going to say there's been a lot of lessons learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| Rule retreat language, it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| In the very beginning, it was very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| We were trying to understand what our limits were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| Decibel readings for us, as a rule retreat, cut off at 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| So no matter what's going on, we've created alternative ways to have music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| They have headsets on for silent disco type things with an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9196)|
| 2:33:20| So we've created ways, and our staff has cut off at 9 p.m. with any noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| That does not apply to the neighborhood around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| So they can play music over the 65 decibels that we're held accountable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| So it's very hard because when the sheriff does come out and we are in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9216)|
| 2:33:43| so in the county you can shoot guns, and if it's being done as a motive against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9223)|
| 2:33:52| there's no recourse into how to get to something, an answer, a solution for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9232)|
| 2:34:00| But the neighborhood thinks it's us, and it's not always us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| Now, I'm not going to say and sit here and deny that there's not been a time or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| that I've had to come back and go, cut this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| We will not have that DJ here again ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| We've put into policies and places decibel readings, bass levels, trebles, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9252)|
| 2:34:17| But we've got decibel readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| The lot fixtures are downward casting the top of everything that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| It's all in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| When codes have come out, we have never had one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| We've never had one thing that's been brought to our attention that we've not met or already been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| So I'll be glad if that would help or if this will help, I'll be glad to get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| I think the mere representation is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| So in 2020, the commission approved, and let me back up by saying we are not an enforcement body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9290)|
| 2:34:57| That's left to codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| We're not here to enforce lighting or sound codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| So in 2020, in June of 2020, the commission approved up to nine overnight accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9304)|
| 2:35:12| I assume that was the request at the time by Agent Laura Billage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9316)|
| 2:35:17| And then based on the current zoning standards for rural retreats, based on the acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9317)|
| 2:35:24| a 41.45 acres staff, a maximum of 14 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9324)|
| 2:35:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| So unless the applicant purchases additional property, then 14 is all you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9333)|
| 2:35:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| That's what we're asking for, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| Unless the standards change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| So based on that, I will make a motion to approve the request for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9348)|
| 2:35:56| And you all need to do maybe a little more community relations with your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9356)|
| 2:36:01| It might help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| We've attempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9365)|
| 2:36:06| So we have a motion on the floor to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| And a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| We still have commissioners to address here, and I'll go with Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| I did turn my light off, but I'll go ahead and ask my question anyway just to get it out there in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9380)|
| 2:36:27| I heard something to the effect that there was some agreement in place or something in the vote on commission in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9387)|
| 2:36:37| and I don't remember there being it, but some agreement that they would limit it to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9397)|
| 2:36:44| I mean, they were approved for nine, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| There's nothing in the record that says that they agreed to seven or that we restricted them to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| Ms. Porsche?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| That's what the record reflects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9422)|
| 2:37:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9423)|
| 2:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Yeah, I don't know if I'm for or against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| The one thing I do have an issue with, though, is D.K. Levy is not here, and I understand he's sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9433)|
| 2:37:24| but he apparently gave his word to some South Knoxville residents, and they took him at that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9444)|
| 2:37:32| I think it would be appropriate for him to be here to be accountable and address exactly why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9452)|
| 2:37:42| Thank you, Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| I agree with you, Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| I understand now with the clarity that there was an approved nine and that that's what everyone agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9469)|
| 2:38:00| and now we're back with an additional request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| And while that seems to fit inside the overall conditions, there was a previous commitment made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9482)|
| 2:38:12| and the community is obviously not completely happy with how that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9492)|
| 2:38:16| I would feel a lot differently if the community was supporting this wholeheartedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9496)|
| 2:38:22| and things were all going peachy and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| So I feel concerned about changing this to 14 now when we're having problems at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9505)|
| 2:38:35| And adding that to Mr. Levy not being present, I have concerns there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9515)|
| 2:38:44| I'm not advocating either side at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| but I also want to be careful that we don't get a bit, I don't know, presumptuous about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9526)|
| 2:38:54| that I think they have the right to designate whomever they want to represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9534)|
| 2:39:00| and so far I've seen no evidence of a formal or a legal commitment to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9540)|
| 2:39:07| And then lastly, I guess a property owner has every right to come back and ask for more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| if it fits within the zoning, so I don't want to penalize someone wrongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9554)|
| 2:39:23| Does anyone have, Attorney Tasha Blakeney, do you have a comment about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| Other than to say that I agree with you, Mr. Chair, there is a, just procedurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9569)|
| 2:39:37| there's a motion to approve and a second, and I understand we're in the discussion phase now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9577)|
| 2:39:43| You have options available to you as commissioners at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| You can vote in favor of the motion that has been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| You can vote against it as you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| If you did wish to oppose that, you could certainly do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| and then subsequently make a motion to, well, let's put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9598)|
| 2:40:04| You are going to have to vote up or down on the motion at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| unless someone is willing to make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| You have the right to postpone, but it would also have to be by vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| and the majority would have to agree to that as well, but that motion has not been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| and that's not what is before you at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| You have to vote on the merits of the actual application first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| unless you can convince the movement to withdraw it or to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9627)|
| 2:40:35| Thank you. I appreciate all clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| I want to ask is it inappropriate to want to have a circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9638)|
| 2:40:50| where there is greater endorsement for, like, there was a commitment made with the last hearing for 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9650)|
| 2:41:02| That's a fact, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| From a legal standpoint, of course, you have the right to make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| Again, to ask for a postponement if the majority agrees for whatever basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| I'm not asking for a postponement. I'm trying to clarify something else now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| Okay. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| And I understand there's a motion on the floor, but I'm still trying to get my head straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| It was a contentious case previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| and that contentious case landed at a vote of the commission approved 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| and the applicant then moved forward and didn't completely build out that density, had 2 left on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9699)|
| 2:41:47| and is now returning to ask for the maximum that they could have in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9707)|
| 2:41:56| And I am just expressing that my struggle with this is that that's a density request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| on top of what was approved previously when it was contentious back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| and it doesn't sound like the contention has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| And so I'm concerned about changing basically the commission's vote from its prior one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9733)|
| 2:42:21| I would feel no concern at all if they built out to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| That's what the commission did, but now it's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| So that's where I'm struggling and I'm saying all that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| because it sounds like where my vote is going to go and I just want to express why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| Certainly, and to answer your question, Commissioner Adams, this is a new application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| and you have the right to consider the history, what you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| and all of the relevant regulations as you make your decision to vote at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9762)|
| 2:42:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9769)|
| 2:42:54| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| Chairman Hill, you said a lot of what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| but I do just want to clarify for everyone in the room, and I don't know Daniel personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9782)|
| 2:43:07| but my understanding is that he's the architect on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| and therefore representing the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| So even if a few years ago he made a comment that he hopes not to have to come back for more requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9793)|
| 2:43:22| let's not hold that against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| And I don't think in that setting that he is fully representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9805)|
| 2:43:31| or speaking for the property owner or the applicant in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| So I just wanted to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| One more question about, and I'm not sure if this is Michelle or Tasha,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9820)|
| 2:43:46| but the comments from the opposition about, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| this is operating as a commercial entity versus what is really allowed in a rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9831)|
| 2:43:59| Can you speak to that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| Yeah, and I think this kind of gets to someone made a comment earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| that the rural retreat language is a little bit vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| I think the intent of an event facility is for sort of banquet events and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| where it's not open to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| Someone basically rents the place for the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| It's not really intended for trivia nights and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9857)|
| 2:44:22| but it doesn't explicitly say that, so it's kind of, I guess, an interpretation question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| So for that I would probably ask Steve his opinion as far as codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9867)|
| 2:44:33| how you all look at events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| because it's nebulous and it's kind of allowed by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| And I'm happy to give you, just while you're, Mr. Elliott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| while you're preparing to respond to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| I'm happy to give you the definition from Knox County's Ordinance of Rural Retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| A facility owned and operated by an entity for the purpose of providing a rural setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| in which lodging, conferences, banquet facilities, restaurants, day spas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| recreational amenities, and meeting event facilities are provided with or without compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| And then it also says that it doesn't include a farm engaged in agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9905)|
| 2:45:10| So it does contemplate these types of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| and then there's kind of some sliding scales based on the size of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9912)|
| 2:45:20| what the density can be and what the operations can be, what the hours, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| But it does contemplate some of what is being referred to as commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9925)|
| 2:45:31| and those comments that were made, just to give you some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9931)|
| 2:45:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| So it sounds like in terms there is an invocation of potential commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9939)|
| 2:45:45| but nothing super specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| It says lodging, conferences, banquet facilities, restaurants, day spa, recreational amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9948)|
| 2:45:54| meeting event facilities, pretty broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| And it sounds like a lot of those activities are happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| I just want to say one other thing in terms of some of the comments that have come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| in favor of the development speaking to the improvement of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9968)|
| 2:46:17| and that there has been improvement there and protection of that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9977)|
| 2:46:23| in a different way than we typically see when a development moves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| So I want to just acknowledge that as well, that those comments have been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| Mr. Elliott, I didn't mean to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| If you had something to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| No, I agree with you and Michelle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| I think it's implied within the rule retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10000)|
| 2:46:43| that there is some sort of commercial operations that will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10003)|
| 2:46:50| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| Steve, while we have you at the desk of opportunity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| do you concur with staff that this amount of acreage would, code wise, you would permit the 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10017)|
| 2:47:05| I just want to make sure that we're clear that we don't have a miscommunication between staff and codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10025)|
| 2:47:10| Yes, no, I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| I think there's nine approved now, so requesting 14 would be five additional approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| And you're saying that the acreage that they have, the surveyed acreage, would support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| Yes, I concur with planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| I just want to make sure we didn't do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| All right, time for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| So we've got a motion and a second to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10051)|
| 2:47:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| We have one in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10065)|
| 2:47:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10070)|
| 2:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10090)|
| 2:48:11| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10091)|
| 2:48:12| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| We have, looks like our applicant is Ms. Porsche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10099)|
| 2:48:27| The recommendation is planning recommends approval of amendments to the Knoxville-Knox County subdivision regulations as identified in attachment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10107)|
| 2:48:38| Staff for the city of Knoxville and Knox County engineering departments are also in support of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10118)|
| 2:48:44| And I'll pitch it to you, Ms. Porsche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| I just didn't put it on consent in case there were any questions or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10128)|
| 2:48:55| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| I'd like to make a motion, Mr. Chairman, to approve the amendments to the Knoxville-Knox County subdivision regulations as identified in attachment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10138)|
| 2:49:09| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10149)|
| 2:49:16| We still have some lights on, and I'll go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| On number eight, reducing the width of private right-of-ways, it almost seems like a private right-of-way, it could be appropriate to do less than 40 feet of width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10163)|
| 2:49:40| Was there consideration, or is there any desire to go less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10180)|
| 2:49:46| No, because of the utilities that go typically to the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| They would require about 10 feet, which is why we wanted to reach out to the utilities to make sure that they were okay with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10189)|
| 2:49:56| For the most part, they were okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| They said the only time they would ever need the 50 would be if there were multiple utilities putting in at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| They might need more width for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| But we wouldn't go 40, less than 40, because the required width for the pavement is 20, and that gives 10 feet on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10206)|
| 2:50:14| And then my other question, I know that a few months ago it came up that there's a suggestion that if you have a certain number of trips for vehicles coming into a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10214)|
| 2:50:29| that you should have two exits or entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| Yes, there's a fire code that states if you have more than, I think it's 250 dwelling units, that you need to have two separate means of egress and egress, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10236)|
| 2:50:47| It's currently 200. We're in the process of amending that to 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10247)|
| 2:50:53| Okay, so we're actually in the process of making it less stringent in that scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10253)|
| 2:50:59| We are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| Not the direction I expected that to be going, but I was curious if there was, because of conversation related to that from some previous cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10262)|
| 2:51:14| I didn't know if making amendments in with these changes might be appropriate, but I guess there's some other things on the horizon, so that's all. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10274)|
| 2:51:26| All right, so we have a motion and a second to approve for staff recommendation. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10286)|
| 2:51:34| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10294)|
| 2:51:43| I guess we'll move on to our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10308)|
| 2:51:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=10315)|
