| 2:07:26| Davis Brace ordered that I bring an up-to-code house up-to-code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7646)|
| 2:07:34| or he was going to demolish the house because he was stating that it was abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7654)|
| 2:07:43| and yet he knew differently, and he also knew that the city and county taxes are paid every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| and in point of fact, the house was not abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| So to pay for the bogus boards that John Ford had arbitrarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| and capriciously placed on 4311 Skyline Drive, my son's car was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7679)|
| 2:08:09| Excuse me, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| Counsel, the time is up, unless somebody would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| I will move to give her three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| According to rules, we'll give you three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| And someone else removed the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7699)|
| 2:08:26| We moved on the order of Davis Brace and ordered by Morris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| to have someone remove my son's car from my premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| Had this been a member of society at large, they would have been hauled off to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| During the course of my absence, KUB ran up charges during the months of November, December of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7721)|
| 2:08:49| and January of 2009, and only charges during these months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| Excuse me, and there's no possible way that those charges could have existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| as before I left the state, I had turned off the air conditioning and the heat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| the only thing that could run up that kind of bill of $1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| The only way that I can keep codes and enforcements off my property is to put a fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| and place no trespassing signs on my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| Had I known that in 2011, I would have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| What I am asking the council to do is to return my son's car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| which has been the driving force behind the fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| and remove all charges assessed by 4320 Skyline Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| and on the car have David Brace and Robert Morris fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7780)|
| 2:09:49| That's all I have to say because there was no legitimate reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| why they should have removed my son's car from the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| considering it was not my property that they were using to pay the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| but someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| And that's a blatant and frequent violation of my Fourth Amendment rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| that you all have taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| And I will give where I was not, just idly sitting by, letting no one know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7811)|
| 2:10:17| because I did write, I did follow the procedure, filed a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| did that, let the mayor know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| The mayor sent me some pictures, and basically not the end result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7823)|
| 2:10:32| but what had happened prior to the problems being faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| I wrote Ms. Branson, and Ms. Branson concurred with David Brace and Robert Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7837)|
| 2:10:43| So I did follow the procedures of filing a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| but it was like they were right and I was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| and nothing else can be said about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| So I will just let you read for yourself in detail what was said about my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7853)|
| 2:11:00| and my son's car, because it was theft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| and the Coast Enforcement Department did circumvent my rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| by not having a warrant to take my son's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| because there was nothing wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| And it did meet the rules of being covered on three sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| and all those other kinds of rules that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| Thank you, Ms. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| Next is Mr. Ulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| Is this what you want copied and just drifted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| We'll take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7899)|
| 2:11:51| Mayor, while she's doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| is there any process where someone can sort of appeal just the discussion decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| to another director or officer to take a second look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| just as a matter of curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| I don't know if we have any process whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| Chris Sebranskam, can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| I believe Mr. Maness wants to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Mr. Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| If you would like, Mayor, I'll be glad to schedule a time to meet with the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| It strikes me that Council's not in a very good position to evaluate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| and we have ñ I know we have strict and important rules on codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| and codes enforcement, but I wonder if someone could take just a fresh look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| We have quite a bit of legal process available for people who are subject to our codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| go through a whole process that they go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| and there are provisions in the code that deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| and there are provisions in state law that deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| Those are available to all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| Mr. Ulrich, you know the rules, and I'm going to get my timer going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7975)|
| 2:13:00| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| My name is Jim Ulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| I live at 551 English Village Way, Apartment 917, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=7986)|
| 2:13:20| The reason I'm here this evening is I won't be here, I'll be out of town in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| and I think you'll have on your agenda an item about whether to close Ben Ashley Street or not in the Bearden Village area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8007)|
| 2:13:41| So I thought I'd come tonight and give you some of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8021)|
| 2:13:48| Back in 2001, there was a Bearden Village opportunities plan that was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8028)|
| 2:13:59| I think it was a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| I think there's a lot of bones here and there's a lot of meat that has to be put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8044)|
| 2:14:14| What concerns me is I haven't really seen anything in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8054)|
| 2:14:22| except maybe for a couple of minor things, that is following this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| or there seems not to be any attempt to follow this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| Let me take just one page of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| Kingston Pike Commercial Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| Recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| Orient buildings toward sidewalks with parking at back of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| Incorporate mixed use between floors of buildings with commercial retail on first floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| and office residential on subsequent floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| Reduce parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Require formal tree plantings along sidewalks with parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8107)|
| 2:15:16| That describes, I think, a good direction that we should be going in this area and all of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8116)|
| 2:15:31| My problem is everything I've seen done since then doesn't fit any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8131)|
| 2:15:40| particularly the last two with Fifth Third Bank and Chick-fil-A, Melrose Place, Cherokee Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8140)|
| 2:15:52| I don't see any change from what Kingston Pike is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| Now maybe people think Kingston Pike is terrific, but I got a little bit higher standards than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8158)|
| 2:16:08| Kingston Pike in Knoxville doesn't look any different than Kingston Pike in any other city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8168)|
| 2:16:15| And if we're going to redevelop, I think we need to change Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8175)|
| 2:16:24| And I think if we went in the direction of this plan, we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| And what disturbs me is 11 years we haven't started that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8191)|
| 2:16:39| And if we would have started 11 years ago, maybe Kingston Pike would look a little bit different west of Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8199)|
| 2:16:49| because somebody would have said, hey, this looks pretty good, just like what some other cities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| You've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| So my problem with that, and one of it is part of it is traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| And that isn't going to be solved overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| And it isn't going to be solved with just a couple of bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| So it's going to take some long-range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| And I'm sure the developer that wants to close Ben Atchley Park doesn't even know this thing exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8241)|
| 2:17:30| because I don't think he's been in the neighborhood that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| So my request is let's decide are we going to do this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| And if we aren't, you know, so I can take it off my shelf and throw it in the waste can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| and the rest of us can do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| Or let's start moving in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| I don't think there is a better place in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| that we can show how to turn an old concept of suburban development based on the automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8285)|
| 2:18:16| and redevelop it into an urban area, which Bearden is now part of the urban area, not the suburban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8296)|
| 2:18:26| And like I say, I don't think there is a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| Ben Atchley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| Do you want to just come to your conclusion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Ben Atchley Street is a north-south street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8316)|
| 2:18:43| North and south is pretty good connectivity in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8323)|
| 2:18:50| East and west has got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| So all I can say is I think what you should decide before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8334)|
| 2:19:01| you decide Ben Atchley is do you want to do this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8341)|
| 2:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Thank you, Mr. Allard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130319?start=8355)|
