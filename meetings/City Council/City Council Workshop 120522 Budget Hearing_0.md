| 0:01:28| You might have to bear with me tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Suffering from the death of my uncle and he was the most important part of my life in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| So if I have to pause every once in a while, please bear with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| One of those days you feel good the next day you want to cry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| We have our neighborhood association and we learned secondhand about a sidewalk project on Sutherland and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| It was not of our design of our making apparently some outside person for whatever reason has proposed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| And it's upset a number of our residents and businesses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| I think 1.7 million was the price tag we read in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| We've got projects on Hollywood that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| six seven eight ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| In the making that we need to have done some traffic islands to keep the big trucks off the road picker children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| Some sidewalks need to be repaired some retaining walls replaced and rebuilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Of course the pond property needs to be a nature area as part of the beard and plan and some other things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| Seemed like 1.7 million is a lot for a sidewalk and I'm told it's going from Hollywood to J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Now you have to bear with me. I might have to do some iffing on this based on what I've been told from. Mr. Hagerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| I took a little trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| Last night. There's a lot of streets in this town that desperately need sidewalks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| Went down to Forest Heights community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| Drove up the road real slow under the speed limit six people are walking out in the road. They have no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| Went down to the Westwood community nice place. I want to see the flowers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| No sidewalks people have to walk out in the road now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| I'm not going to stand here and say I'm proposing those communities need sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| But I'd rather than be guilty of what I criticize these outsiders for doing coming into my neighborhood without our knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| not seeking our input on projects, and this is not the first second or third time this has happened and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| That really distresses us I think with talking mr. Hagerman that 1.7 million you could do what we want done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| Far less expense and give the money to the city workers pension fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| I think that would be very wise now if if this was true about the sidewalk now, mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| Hagerman told me apparently it's just some crosswalks. They're going to be put in well. That's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| I emphasize the point and he will hardly agreed with me that we need to have the input of the pond gap neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| And we've got signs up all over the neighborhood that you can't miss those you you can sort of learn what our boundaries are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| I've always been respectful for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Neighborhoods boundaries and so forth like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| You've got a big neighborhood sign and several locations and other markers and so forth if they're going to build a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| We need to work with our association those businesses and make this something really unique and wonderful take advantage of the unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| history of this part of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| And I could go on for hours about that important part that block on Sutherland from Hollywood to Jade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| That's very important to us. We could make something really nice if this is design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| But like I said, I'm sort of if in my way through this we're just based on what I've been told secondhand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| Mr.. Brown, thank you so much for telling us about I think the Bearden Council proposed this and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Would like to know when they have their meetings would we like to go we did my dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| And I went to one a couple years ago unfortunately postpone it the night before and we are part of Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| We like to say pond gap is where Bearden's day begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| Really that's all I got to say except we buy gypsy friends and pond gap have a name for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| outsiders that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Don't respect our neighborhood or our values everything gajo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| So let's don't listen to gajos listen to people in pond gaps or any questions. I'm most happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| Councilman grief. Oh, thank you mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| David as I said to you on the telephone the other day that part of what what what is happening is the planning process with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| The budget, and we don't know whether or not the budget's going to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Secondly the million seven. I'm not sure where that came from but what we were looking for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| 225,000 and if you really want to point fingers to anyone in terms of what's going on you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| If you want to you can point your fingers at me if you want to call me an outsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Dan Brown has the east of Hollywood, and I have the west of Hollywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Sutherland Avenue even though you kind of claim it as your neighborhood is a major thoroughfare going into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| The University of Tennessee is putting all those fields across the way as you know and you have been kept informed about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| Part of what was developing is that the university has made an agreement that they will help with the crosswalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| this is how this whole thing started and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| What we were looking at is the possibility that actually if you recall Jeff Owen V| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Was trying to get with the county and the city to work with the university to get crosswalks in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| And especially down near West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| What what was being looked at is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Because of the students that are going to be there and because of the businesses across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| The feeling was that one of the reasons that this project is being looked at seriously is because there really is a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| There we already have the greenway on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| And so what was being looked at is the possibility of not only three or four crosswalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| But especially right there at Hollywood just down from your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| Going over to the market then crossing Hollywood and then going back the sidewalk goes up to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| So what was going to be looked at and it's not definite yet as I told you the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| Is that if the money is available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Can we not only do the crosswalks and then also the crosswalks from the parking lot the new parking lot that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| University's putting in which by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| They're also providing parking spaces for the general public for the greenway and which will also be used by those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| That it seemed like that where the roadway used to be or the entrance into the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| Athletic fields that there be crosswalks there in order for students to walk over to the to the restaurants that are on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| So the idea was and because we've been involved in a lot and you're not purposely being left out as far as I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| It's just a matter of where we are is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| That if the money's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| What we'd like to do is to meet with the businesses and meet with you folks as well as the Bearden Council as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| the new little neighborhood down from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Sutherland Heights from West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Because really what we're talking about is a safety issue and trying to get the crosswalks, you know going across there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| So that's kind of where that's kind of where we are right now in terms of in terms of what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| crosswalks have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Looked at from the standpoint of how much they cost what they could look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| no decisions have been made in terms of what they look like because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| We didn't know whether or not we were going to have any money from the city any money from the county or any money from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| The university has agreed to help with matching monies in order to you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Provide these crosswalks which we hope you know, which we hope will happen on that. So we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Concerned about crosswalks down at the at the high school right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| It's just marked on the pavement and what we're talking about is the possibility of crosswalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| So we're not even sure where the sidewalks are going to go. The main thing is to get the crosswalks first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| work with the businesses and work with you people to see how this all could be done, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| You know again if you have a feeling that we're encroaching on your neighborhood as far as I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Sutherland Avenue belongs to the whole city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| We do want to work with the neighborhoods that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| which also brings up that I would still you know for the record like to have your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Bylaws from your neighborhood association and your membership and also minutes my other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| Neighborhood associations that are in my district also provide those for me and I've I've been asking you for that for some time for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| So we would like to have that too, but we will include you on whatever, you know development occurs there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| That's that's kind of the history of where we are and Dan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| I know you have the eastern part of pond gap and I have the western part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| But Sutherland Avenue is really as far as I'm concerned the main city street, but we will work with you on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Councilman Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I'll try to do a better job to keep the pond gap neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| Informed of things that are happening in the neighborhood. I know you keep up very well with what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| but I'll try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Keep it a little more informed on that as we go along and hopefully we'll all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| For the good of the whole city and the whole neighborhood down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| We appreciate you giving the information and I got the 1.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| May if I'm allowed to respond from the new Sentinel and everything and I need to do to correct you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| You provide me a lot of information now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| But we just have not been kept informed along the way and I'll say again with UT up until two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| we were notified in advance of any public announcement, but as far as having an opportunity for any input we're basically told what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| were going to do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| it's that's very misleading to say they work with the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| I'll go back to our membership about the bylaws and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| I might request this. Can we get a copy of the Bearden Council bylaws and membership list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| I'd like to know these people that are trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| decisions for us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| As the Bearden Council ever proposed anything for Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| With or without their approval that brings up another point I'll be brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Sequoia Hills Homeowner Association opposed the ball fields the emerald fields across the river on the old air farm site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| So be that what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Of course you you might remember the University gentleman said that we they looked at a number of sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120522budgethearing?start=681)|
