| 0:00:00| You know, somebody could leave their credit card at Hump Hammers and I could eat all week on $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| Would you feel better, Commissioner Moore, Chairman Moore, if there was a daily limit put on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10)|
| 0:00:17| I mean, here's, this looks like, I don't remember who brought it up, but about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=17)|
| 0:00:21| we had almost the same thing on the agenda and I supported it then and I support it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=21)|
| 0:00:26| I think these are very reasonable restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=26)|
| 0:00:30| And, yeah, if somebody wants to stretch the rules, I'm sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| there's a lot of folks that, nobody in this governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| but I'm sure that there are people in legislative bodies throughout this country that still take brown paper bags full of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=38)|
| 0:00:48| If somebody's going to break the rules, they're going to break the rules and I hope they get caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| I think these are very reasonable rules that I can certainly live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| And I think the limitations, you know, I don't think somebody's going to influence my opinion if they buy me lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| In fact, I generally buy lunch as often as it's bought for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| You know, would you feel better if there was a daily limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| And, Mr. Hammond, would you accept a friendly amendment of a daily limit of, say, two meals per day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| No, I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| The basic reason for this is have some type of clarification so that if someone says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=83)|
| 0:01:31| I saw you eating somewhere and you had a lavish meal and we feel it influenced your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| I mean, if you have the $35 limit, you know, and, again, the city has $25, the state has $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| I mean, governments everywhere have these limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| But it's like if you're, I was invited to speak at the Farragut Rotary Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| They had a buffet lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| It wasn't $35, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| I could have pulled out my checkbook and wrote a check or give them cash for that meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| I could have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| I was at Gibbs, for example, when they were having their evening out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| And a lady came up to me with a bag of cookies and said, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| I'd love to have you have some of these fresh baked cookies for coming out and joining us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| I don't want to look at that lady and say, I'm sorry, I can't take your cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| And I don't think that the public out there sees that as being unreasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| to be able to take tokens of gratitude like that for things that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| To me, that's just courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| And so what this does is it has those types of things in there so that we don't get into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| where political opponents, for whatever reason, may be coming in and saying, oops, saw you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| We went to Crown College the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| It was a very great evening, something that I enjoy going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| It was a good meal, but it wasn't $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| And we could have all pulled out our checkbooks and wrote a check to Crown College, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| there were 2,500 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| I was at an event the other evening where some city of Knoxville officials were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| and I actually paid for mine, and they didn't pay for theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| I mean, we can get into this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| All this does is it tries to clarify so everybody understands what's acceptable and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| And I think that's a reasonable figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Well, I was going to say, as a member of Temple Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| I'm willing to write any check you want to Crown College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| But, Scott, would you be okay if we had a daily cap of two meals per day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| I think what I'd like to see, if we're at an elementary school or we're at a middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| and the PTA is furnishing cookies, I think that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Or if we're at Crown College, you know, I wrote a check when I left there for Crown College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| But I think we need to do all we possibly can to ensure to the people in Knox County that we're going to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| and be responsible and accountable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| And I just think having somewhere a $35 limit for every occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| I can tell you there's probably not many times I go somewhere where I eat by myself, it's $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| And to have that where you could have $140 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| I mean, we can make $4,500 a month extra just by letting somebody buy our meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| I don't think that's the way public officials should act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| If we want to say that we could eat at PTA or if we can eat at something that's of nominal value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=256)|
| 0:04:27| but not just have someone take us out to a restaurant and buy us a steak dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| or whatever they're going to buy us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| You know, if I go out with you, I'll buy my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| I mean, that's how you clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| What's so hard about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| You don't take nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| That's pretty clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| But you're not saying you don't take anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| You were saying about cookies and you were saying about other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| This is what this policy addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I mean, we're talking about it says foods and refreshments of nominal value when they're there as part of an employee's participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| a charitable, civic, or political event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| All of these things are covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| And I'll have to say I've had some meals that were thrown for charity where it might not have necessarily been a $35 meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=301)|
| 0:05:10| but there were $35 tickets that were printed up for that meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| And I just don't see the problem with having dinner with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| I'll call for the question unless there are any more live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Commissioner Strickland's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Mike, I have a question on page three of the lobbying by former officials, local officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| What was the rationale for four years relative to the right to work law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| Well, the notion here was lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| There are organizations and governments that restrict lobbying by former elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| This was just an attempt to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Of course, anyone who is on county commission or any other who comes as a citizen can lobby a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| or school board or anybody as a private citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| This was for paid compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| If you were hired by a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Why the four years relative to right to work laws, which are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| I had recommended one year, but the committee recommended four and the committee voted on four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| I guess I have a problem with that because we have right to work laws that did less than four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=372)|
| 0:06:22| Yes, but, you know, we can place certainly what we would call reasonable restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| This, I think, would fall within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| We talked about that at great length in our committee meeting, in the committee meeting with the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=391)|
| 0:06:41| And one year was proposed, and I think we talked about three years, and they settled on four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| You can change that if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| This is your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| This is your policy for all of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| My personal view is I think it should be less because right to work laws are much less than four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| State right to work laws, federal right to work laws, and I think one year is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=418)|
| 0:07:08| Four years is way too much, in my opinion, in your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| I would agree with you on the one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| But, again, this was the committee decision and that they were bringing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Everybody is going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| I think it should be our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Do you want to add that, see if you can add that to the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| Commissioner Hammond was the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I'll make the motion with the amendment that the lobbying be for one year instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Did you accept the two meals a day limit that I proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| Sure, I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| That would be another amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Is that Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| I believe I did second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I'd be happy to accept both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Yes, I have one question for Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| For instance, Joe May is a lobbyist and he was a state representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| How would that affect his position with commission and city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| It wouldn't affect his position at all because he was a member of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| but it's been many years since he was a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| So it wouldn't affect him at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Okay, I guess we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| I'll just end with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| I think that's what this does here tonight is say one lobster is okay, but two is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| So I'll be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| So if we're ready to vote, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| So following the item that's $35 per occasion, we'll put in the phrase with a limit of two meals per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Okay, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Resolution 914 is approving an investigation pursuant to Section 2.202H of the Knox County Charter of the allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| in an article published in the Hosshopper on January 7, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| The motion failed on a vote of two to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=560)|

| 0:09:25| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Motion to approve three to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=566)|

| 0:09:31| Move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Motion made by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Second by Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=580)|
| 0:09:47| Mr. Chairman, we talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Commissioner Ivan Harmon for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| I'm not going to demagogue this to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I think everybody here knows how I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Tyler Harbor made allegations in a confessional to Betty Bean with the Hosshopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| Some of them were pretty nasty allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| I want to know if they're true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Once and for all, I want to get Mr. Harbor under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| I want to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| I want to see what he says under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| and then I want to talk to the folks that he makes the accusations about under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| The strongest accusation, the most disturbing was about that one of his dirty tricks was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| that he had acquired the medical records for two radio talk show hosts, Lloyd and Kelvin Moxley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| These folks are good friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| If their privacy was violated, I'd just like to know if it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| And that's all I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| And, like I said, I know it's a dead horse and I know I'm still here beating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| but it's a personal matter to me because these were personal friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| You know, we keep talking about beating the dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| You know, guys, this is what's given us the reputation that we're getting here in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| It's this horse is under the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Let's up it or down it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| It's time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| And I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| I mean, a lot of that I went back and did some research and had a lot of research done in the Hall Shopper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| with what Betty Bing said in interviews that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| But one thing that I remember when she wrote the article, it says, in the very first paragraph of one of the very extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| that she was talking about, she says, Tyler Harper, and then she puts in parentheses, a known perpetual liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| Well, then why read it from there on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| If the guy's a known liar, I have no credibility in what the guy says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| I've never met the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| And then the attorney general has come down here and he said he's looked at it three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| He said there's nothing to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| I mean, I don't care to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| I don't care one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| But we beat it to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| We beat it to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| And if it fails today, you know, let's put this to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| I guess here's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| There's been a lot of things go on over the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| And it seems that some commissioners are trying to go after this person or that person or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| And, guys, if you want to do that, get your own attorney and do it yourself instead of taking up our time at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=743)|
| 0:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| Who's the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| So it takes two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| So the chair rules that it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| We'll make sure the clerk gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| I think you voted no and I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| I'm the only aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| Okay, we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Mr. Chairman, let me say something about Tyler Harbor, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| To bring Tyler back, what he did, if he did do it with a misdemeanor and the statute of limitations up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| That's what the Attorney General told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| So to bring him back for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| For entertainment purposes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| I get enough on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| Well, I think if he did what he said he did, looking at someone's medical records is a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| Well, that's when those guys need to bring it to the Attorney General themselves, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=837)|
| 0:14:07| Okay, Clerk, 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=847)|
| 0:14:16| This is approving to request a report regarding the Knox County Green Waste Facility located at 8707 Joe Daniel Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=856)|
| 0:14:26| on the suggested recommendations identified by CH2M Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| a timeline as to when these recommendations will be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| and a timeline as to when the nuisance odor will be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Okay, Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Voted 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=885)|
| 0:14:54| Yes, do we have a motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| I'll make a motion just to put it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| I've got a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Okay, hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Let me just clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| This is Commissioner Harmon's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| He had basically two parts to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| What you're reading is the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| The second part I did not put in the resolution, Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| because it would bring us out of compliance with our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| The second part basically required the green waste facility to only receive Knox County waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=933)|
| 0:15:42| and that is not at all what our contract provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| So I did not put that provision within the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Mr. Law Director, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| I've also received further communication that one of the things that we receive from out of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| are wood product waste, which actually helps reduce the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| And so that would be sort of counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| And so I understand what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| I also want Mr. Mays, if he's here, I think I see him back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| to know that I was just talking to Bruce Weitrick at the break, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| and we now have that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| And I've asked you to share it in both electronic and hard copy with Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Yes, sir, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| And you will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| So, Mr. Mays, I did my level best to do what you submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| and that is the sort of good news, bad news outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| And you're nodding, so I'll take that as some affirmation that we did our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Let me just ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Somebody called me over the weekend and said he's talking about the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| The contract calls for the county to receive funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and they said so far we have not received any monies from the people operating natural resources to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| Now, I don't know who's Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| I guess you're the new director, so can you tell us, are we receiving checks from the Greenway facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1026)|
| 0:17:19| It kind of predates Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| As many of you know, Tom Salter is the new director of Solid Waste, replacing John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| I guess I'm going to, because there's a lawsuit involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I may have to defer to Mr. Owens as to how in-depth he wants me to go into the explanation in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| Well, I don't need somebody to go into in-depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| If someone's supposed to pay something on the contract, are they paying it, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| No, they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| And who authorized that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Would that not be something that has to come back for this body since we approved the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| It is my, I am of the opinion, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I discussed this matter with John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| John essentially was not insisting on the collection of the, I think it was $1.50 per cubic yard on the mulch that was being sold out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1081)|
| 0:18:11| He had, in his mind, he had very legitimate reasons why he was not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| In my mind, that is something that should have been brought back to commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| So how much money do you think over the last, what was the inception of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| When did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| I had that number once before, but I cannot recall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I don't want to just shoot from the hip from down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Mr. Mayor, do you want to respond to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I wasn't aware of it, and I'm glad we found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you for asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| And, you know, I just, you know, it would be nice to know if any other contracts out there that we're supposed to be getting money from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| I mean, who, at the end of the day, who's responsible for seeing that these contracts are followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| and the money's coming into the taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| I mean, whose office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| I'm not going to be criticizing someone who's just recently deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| So that's not my intent or purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| When we see errors, we will begin immediately to try and correct them or fix them, as we always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| I would hope that you all would do the same thing in your dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| But I'm not going to be chastising Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Well, I'm not going to criticize Mr. Evans, but is he the one that would receive the check in the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| and would deposit it to the finance department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| How would it come into the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Like the mayor, I don't want to be talking about John Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| but essentially it was John's responsibility to oversee the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| When I found out about it, it was sometime in September time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and then we began negotiations with Natural Resource Recovery to essentially say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| we've got to set this back right, and that's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| The only other question, is there some kind of waste that's coming in from Oak Ridge that's being dumped there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1194)|
| 0:20:04| some ash that may have arsenic in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| I think at one time there was some what they call bottom ash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| and bottom ash was being used with the composting operation because it inhibits the smell problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| that we have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| It did test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| It did have low levels of arsenic in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| We have not been bringing any bottom ash back up out there since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Was that in compliance with the contract at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I think the problem was is that we are licensed for certain products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| or commodities that can be brought up there, but I don't believe that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Commissioner, you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Well, I was actually going to see if we could defer this for 30 days, but apparently we're hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| Mr. Keene, do you feel okay going forward with this, or would you prefer to wait until Mr. Draper returns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| That was my point being here and remaining here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| I have a law partner, David Draper, who I believe communicated with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| We first learned about this resolution coming on, I think he told me, on about Thursday of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| Mr. Draper is unable to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| I last talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| He was somewhere over about Monterey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| The client cannot be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Other representatives of the client cannot be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Now, I don't mind speaking in connection with the situation with Mr. Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| and I don't have a complete background of understanding on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| and I'm certainly not as technically oriented on this whole project as Mr. Draper is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| But there were a number of issues related to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| There were a number of things that Knox County was to have done under the terms of the contract that weren't done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1317)|
| 0:22:05| that ended up having to be done and paid for by this client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| And there was a basis for the non-payment, if you will, of the funds that came to, that were to come to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1328)|
| 0:22:17| All I can tell you is that the client was, you know, informed that that was not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| It may not have met the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| It may not have been done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| But there was a basis for Mr. Evans in doing what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| I don't think tonight, given the set of circumstances that exist, is the time to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| I was here to ask that when I saw this matter go on the agenda, I was here to ask that it be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| Mr. Draper has been in meetings with Mr. Weitrick, Mr. Owings, John Evans before he died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| and now his successor dealing with issues and, if you will, straightening out matters on this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1373)|
| 0:23:03| And I think it would be beneficial to this body to have before you the people who have the knowledge to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| and deal with your issues rather than try to act tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| I, as a matter of courtesy, would ask that the matter be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Let them have an opportunity to be here, try to deal with your questions or concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| and at the same time look at this resolution and see whether or not they have suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| or problems with what's being posed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| As I already pointed out, there was one thing that Mr. Draper did mention to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| at least the one he had seen, there was a portion of the request that was not likewise, like Mr. Owings said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1416)|
| 0:23:45| not in accordance with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| But the long and short of it is my purpose of being here was to ask respectfully that you postpone consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| of this resolution, bring it up again in 30 days, at least they'll have an opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Mr. Chairman, in that line, may I suggest the following action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| Because Mr. Mays is going to get his report, because the second part of his resolution has been removed from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| why don't we simply pass a substitute resolution saying that at the next commission meeting we would like to receive a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| on the status of the contract and the payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| And I would advance that as a substitute motion and we could pass that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Would you be okay with that, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| I don't know what he means by and the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| It started out when we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| The status of the contract, then, if you're so inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| If you want to just talk about it and you'd like to have some further report regarding the status of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| I've got no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Now, is the contract up for renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I guess here's where I'm at with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And I certainly don't want people to think that, I mean, this is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| These are my constituents that are smelling this odor when it comes about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| So I don't want to sound like I'm being soft on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| But the situation is, is that as far as the financial situation, that's in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| I mean, that's going to be decided by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| If their contract were up for renewal, I would be the first person to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| let's postpone renewal of any contract pending the outcome of this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| I would not want to renew a contract with someone where there was a question as to whether they had fulfilled the previous contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| So if that were the situation, if this were up for renewal, I would be all for discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| But I just think we need to wait until the outcome of this lawsuit as far as the financial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| And as far as the odor situation, I do believe that Mr. Mays needs to, needs an explanation of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| and when the problem is going to be solved and how it's going to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| But the primary attorney is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| They've also got Mike Cohen that is speaking for them on occasion, isn't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| I mean, that's why I think we need to postpone this, is put this off until we have the folks here to address this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1569)|
| 0:26:18| Did he get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Commissioner Lambert, because I was going to second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I don't know if I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| I think he made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1587)|
| 0:26:27| It was my motion that we simply have a discussion at the next meeting of the status of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| No, I'd already had the substitute motion on the floor to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| Either one is acceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| If I might speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| We're going to give you time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Just hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| We need to find out where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Clerk, what was the, was it a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Substitute motion to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| To defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| So, Commissioner Mark Harmon wanted to add the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| Will you all take that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| And discuss the status of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Is the contract up for, when is the contract up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| It's not up, but I think we just talk about the way things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I think that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Can anybody tell me when it's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I guess what I'm saying, I'm all for discussing the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I realize that that's in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Well, how about the status of the operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| We'll know next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Yeah, we'll know next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Will that include, would that include someone from solid waste determining how much should have came to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1650)|
| 0:27:41| if no money has came and have that figure for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| And I just want to confirm, we are involved in this lawsuit now, aren't we, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| What I've done is retain the services of an attorney to give us an evaluation, which should be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| We should have that by the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| That sounds like a good friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| This is for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| John, in this contract, are they to pay us monthly or yearly or every six months or how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| I was just looking for the contract, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I believe that it is monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| I thought I brought it down with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| The tipping fees are paid monthly and the revenue sharing fees are paid quarterly as my memory serves me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| I've read the contract over thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Then if that's true, this next question is for Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I realize you're new, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| I think how long have you been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| About seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| About seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Well, you've been there over a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Have you implemented anything on how we're going about to collect this money yet, if it's monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| Just the calculations of the amount of money, I believe, are part of the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| No, I'm talking about what we've sent in the last seven weeks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| We're supposed to get a dollar and a half a cubic yard for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Have you put anything in effect to see that we've started getting this money now since it's to be paid monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Well, I think you need to start on that first thing in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| They've got seven weeks on us now that they haven't paid yet and are to pay monthly at a dollar and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Do you know how much we've sent out there in the last seven weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Well, here's another month gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| I would suggest in the morning that you start figuring out how much we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| and we need to collect that money if it's on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| We don't need to let this go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Commissioner Lambert, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Well, yeah, I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I'm with Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| I do believe we need to start currently collecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| And I understand you're stepping into a job, you know, midstream and very tragic circumstances that brought it about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1790)|
| 0:30:00| So I'm not putting any fault on you whatsoever, but just request that you do start collecting current payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1800)|
| 0:30:11| The contract expires June 30, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| When was it signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| January 1, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| So we've gone four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Once again, it's not my purpose here and not my particular function in connection with this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| But I don't want to stand quietly by and not say to this body that the issue over whether those funds are due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1840)|
| 0:30:51| or not under the contract is at best in dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| So I think when you start talking about collecting all that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| you need to at least comprehend that there's at least an argument, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| for lack of a better way of describing it, as to whether or not there are any funds due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| Tonight is not necessarily the time to deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Those issues are going to be dealt with by lawyers and interpreting what has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and what the legal status of the contract is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| And I do know that there has been discussion among the various parties about how to treat all of those issues going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1887)|
| 0:31:40| but I don't think there's yet been a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And I don't know whether that resolution will be reached by next month or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| but certainly we'll be here or we will certainly attempt to be here to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Mr. King, I'm not talking about these prior things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| I'm talking about collecting money from this point on, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| If it's due Knox County, then we need to start collecting it from this point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| I realize we're in a lawsuit about the back, but from right now, from this point on, if it's due Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| we need to collect it monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I'll agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| If it's due, you need to collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Mr. King, I think the issue is that you may say it's not due and it may not be due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| but this commission was never notified of a contract change by either party, either by the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| or by natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| And we approved the contract and at least we should have been notified that there was a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| and that we needed to amend the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I mean, that's just good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Also, might I point out that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Keep your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| I am the man who filed the false claims lawsuit against this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| I didn't come here tonight to talk about this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| What I came here tonight is something that I couldn't talk about because I was under seal for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| During my investigation of this, I come across many times statements that Len Mays was my father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:19| and that Len Mays was making fraudulent odor control complaints against this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| in an attempt to shut down the competition of the family business, which is my mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| This has been told to me by public officials and this has been told to me by the private sector as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| I'm here to publicly state that I am not related to Len Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| He is not my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| He is not my uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Anyone who has informed you of that has misinformed you of the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| I have tape recorded my conversations regarding this investigation to the point that I've actually wore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| microphones into several offices, including the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| And I would like to point out that many public officials have been less than professional with me when I have asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| where this money is, to a point it has offended me as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| I've been insulted for having my property taxes paid late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I've been insulted in many ways and treated in a very unprofessional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| Len Mays is not related to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| And I would hate to think that this rumor of him being my father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| and me and him working together to try and shut down the family business's competition has not been used to discredit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| his odor control complaints and also not used to discredit my lawsuit against this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| I can document what has happened in this case, and I'm sure it will come out in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| One thing I'd like to tell you now is that the excuses used for not paying this contract have changed multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| And some of those excuses I can document to be false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| I also have multiple sets of numbers for the number of yards being reported sold for the year 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| I would like to point that out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| I don't want to comment in depth on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| There are certain issues that I'm going to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| But I do think it would be good at this point if the county commission asked Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| exactly how long he has known that this money has not been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| I think he's already answered that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| He knew it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| He told us a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Mayor Ragsdale has known this money was missing since June the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Would you like to confirm that, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I didn't want to have to file this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| I'm in the mulch business in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| And I believe the fact that I have the same last name as Lynn Mays has ticked something in somebody's brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| and drug me into this lawsuit, drug me into this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| I didn't want to be involved in this, but I was dragged into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| I was dragged into it when Knox County was paying Knox County employees to advertise a private business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| who was selling private products imported for Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| This contractor's number one selling product in the year of 2006 had nothing to do with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| It was a private product sold to help some other community in Georgia get rid of their products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| Their number one selling product had nothing to do with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And Knox County employees have been handing out advertisements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| and putting up signs on public property to help him advertise to compete with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Then I found out that they make some contract agreement that, in a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| gives them a dollar and 50 cents per yard subsidy to help them compete with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| It would be the same as if you have two gas stations on one corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and Knox County is going to help one of them sell their gas for 50 cents a yard cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| What would happen to the other gas station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Can I interrupt you right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| We've got a five-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I would like to say something, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| You've just brought this to county commission's attention, haven't you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| You know, you call me and talk to me and I'm sure several of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I don't think any commissioner here fits in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| The county commission have been more than professional with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Okay, I just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| The county commission has been very professional with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Paul Pinkston has been very professional with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| But I have had other instances where it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| I've had three months I've been trying to get a hold of one document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I actually came to the courthouse wearing a wire just last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| and went into the Department of Neighborhoods to retrieve a letter that Grant Rosenberg read to me over the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| telling me the excuses why this contractor has not paid this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| I wanted to get a copy of this letter so I could document these falsehoods in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| because I believe, in my personal opinion, them to be false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| They refused to give me this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I've requested it multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I went into their office Friday and Mrs. Rader pulled the letter up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I could see it on her computer and she left the room for a minute and came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| And another lady comes in there and tells me that I can't have the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| I had a freedom of information request prepared with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| It was refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| They wouldn't let me view the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| They wouldn't turn the letter over to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| And they said that they did this under the instruction of Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| And I asked her, does Grant Rosenberg have the authority to override a Freedom of Information Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| And her response to me was, she don't know, but I'm not getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Now, I'm a citizen of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| I pay taxes in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| And this is a public document that has to do with hundreds of thousands of dollars of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| And when I go and ask for it, I should be able to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| I've been asking for this one letter for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Mr. Mays, if you'll get me the information and the letter you want, I will ask for it in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I apologize for being so emotional with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| You can imagine I've been through quite a bit with my business over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| But if you'll get that for me, we'll ask for it in the morning and try to get it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I just want to say that there are smell problems in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| And those smell problems tend to affect Mr. Mays, Lynn Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| Who am I not related to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| You are not related to a much greater degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I've been out there at all hours of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| I've been out there on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| And, yes, there is a detectable odor at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And sometimes it can be worse than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| So I just want to say for anybody here, I have been out there on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| There is an odor problem that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| And we're hoping that the odor issue will be rectified based on recommendations from the company that's looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| I'd also like to point out one other thing right now concerning the odor complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| This company only does business in two towns, as far as my knowledge, Knoxville, Tennessee and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, they had a long odor control compliance history long before they were hired to come to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| They had an odor control compliance history with complaints for the past eight or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| The Baton Rouge, I guess their equivalent of city council for their parish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| voted unanimously not to renew some of their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| And the reason they marked for that or they mentioned in that, one of the major reasons was odor control compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| They sent a letter to the state of Louisiana asking the state of Louisiana to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| So when their own hometown can't even get them to comply with odor control compliance for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| to the point they're having to vote against them with their own city council in their hometown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| then how were they wanting to guarantee Knox County that they were going to do odor control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| They've done this before with the odor patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| They've had this problem in Louisiana before they ever came to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| And not only that, according to a conversation that I had with their council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| in their district, one Ulysses Bones Addison, they had made some sort of verbal promise to pay 50 cents per cubic yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| and revenue sharing to the community down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| And they reneged on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| And that 50 cents a yard went missing, just like our $1.50 a yard is missing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| And it's a lot more than $53,000 like the new Sentinel reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars here, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| We've got Lynn Mays that wanted to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| So, Lynn, if you'll give us your name and address for the record at 755.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Lynn Mays, 10017 West Emory Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| Our community has been fighting this odor problem since February 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Here we are 15 more days and it will be three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| At least we're not in the ten years that Louisiana has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| But for three years we've been trying to eliminate this odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| One, Knox County requested this permit from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| States, we're aware of the potential odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| We can and will control the odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Well, that didn't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| When the state of Tennessee issued a permit to Knox County, it states in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| you will abide by air quality regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| But, well, during this process, I went to air quality on them several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| What does air quality do to help our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| They delete part of the nuisance clause where you take account of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| If a certain percentage of them finds a nuisance, they've got to shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| They get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Then in the regulations since inception, but all of a sudden, let's just strike this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| Director of Solid Waste, we had problems with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| They would never admit to a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| When they finally admit to a problem, the mayor said, okay, we're going to settle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| It will be finished by December 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| December 2005 come and went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| I'll be in March 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| March 2006 comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Two times we've been promised by the mayor's office, the people that manage this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| the people that own this facility, this is the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| It will cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| It never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| I've been before this commission body I don't know how many times to get your assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| And only one time prior to tonight, Mr. Lambert and Ms. Cablewood was going to bring an issue up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| That resolution, three or four days before the vote, they had a meeting in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Then all of a sudden that resolution just went to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| And it was voted on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| And they were supposed to provide a report within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| And I don't know, I wasn't here 90 days later, but I've talked about that three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| And now I'm here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| It's not only odor problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| We brought up the problem of heavy metals, compost coming in from the nuclear plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| Our efforts, our community efforts, we hadn't accomplished anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I thought when TDEC went in to inspect it, it wasn't our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Somebody went up there and bought compost, took it out, took a sample, sent it, got it sampled, sent it to EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| And EPA said, hey, this is beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| They come up here and inspected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| They felt the heavy metals exceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I thought it was our doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| No, it was somebody, some Joe Blow, that took this sample and got the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| Our efforts as a community hasn't accomplished anything until tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| Three years to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Three years I brought this to the mayor's office, the assistant mayor's office, this commissioner, director of solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| director of air quality, and every single time something's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Go see this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Go see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Now, I'm just asking you guys to mandate they provide a report next month on the findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2705)|
| 0:45:14| when these findings will be implemented, and a time scale of when this odor will be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| We've been trying to get this for three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I think it's time to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you, Mr. Mase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Okay, we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Commissioner Lambert, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yeah, I just, Mr. Mase, thanks for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| And we are working on this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| There are new things that have come to light that we're going to be looking into as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| And I appreciate you coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| And we are, you know, I'm working hard to try to, I want to fix the problem without having to close the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2743)|
| 0:45:53| See, that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| All this time when this stuff comes up, we can and will control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| We can and will control the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| But all of a sudden, the mayor, we can't control that odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| Mr. Lambert, we can't control that odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| The lawyer for facility, Mr. Draper, we can't control the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| We can't eliminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Hey, for three, two years, two and a half, we can control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| And all of a sudden, when it starts coming up, hey, we can't control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Well, I think we have definitions of, I mean, my definition of control the odor is that it's not that bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| and doesn't occur that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| I don't think we're ever going to get to a point where you never smell anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| I think there's always going to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| It's a mulch factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| So you got the director of air quality mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| You have a regulation that we could have actually done something by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Well, we'll just strike it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Now they can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Well, no, I don't think we should strike any regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| They did strike it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| What do you mean you don't think they did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Oh, I mean, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| I mean, I'm saying I would not be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| They told me they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| They told me that regulation is no longer existing, the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| I haven't verified that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| But if it's still there, then I want to utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| They should not have taken that out if they did take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| Well, if they didn't, I want to utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| I want the director of air quality, their people to go out and take a survey of our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| if it's still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Can someone check on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Tom, can you check on that and see if that clause is still in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Lucence clause, 15-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| I'll check on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Check on that and get back with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| We've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Commissioner Lutho, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Mr. Law Director, if half the things I've heard here tonight are true, can we not do away with this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| Do we have an out clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| There is a termination provision contained within the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Like I say, we are looking into the lawsuit to determine if they are making a valid claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| If they are in violation of this much money and the other things that the gentleman has suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2877)|
| 0:48:07| I think it's time just to find a new contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| You're going to find, I don't want to try the lawsuit here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| but you're going to find some opinions within Knox County that might be more forgiving of some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:25| quote, violations, unquote, of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Well, I think it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| And so we have to deal with those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Well, I think by next month we need to try to have some answers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| And I would like for you, Mr. Law Director, if you could have it prepared for next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| whether or not we should terminate this contract with this company and put it out for bid for another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2921)|
| 0:48:50| I believe the motion or the amended motion on the floor is to defer to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| to additionally report on the status of the contract on the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Have I missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| I think the wording was just status of the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I think that was just where we stood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| I don't think it said contract, but I'm okay with either wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| Status of the operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Although I'm accepting I can live with either wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Do we have to give just cause to terminate our contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Well, I think we might need to be prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| Mr. Owens, how long have you known about the nonpayment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| And is that enough for just cause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| There are certainly reasons that National Resources Recovery are going to assert that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2981)|
| 0:49:52| that Knox County is not entitled to the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| They have certain defenses that they're going to assert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| And like I say, not all persons within Knox County government will disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| Were there contracts up here in June anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| But, John, I think, I know we've got problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| June the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| But the real question to me is who should have came to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| and said there's a problem with the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| These guys are not paying us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| I mean, it seems like a lot of people have known and we've known today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| So if there's a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| What you had was, actually, you had a lawsuit that was under seal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| and we couldn't bring it to the attention, to the commission's attention based upon the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| And so only last month was it unsealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Pardon me for interrupting, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| This lawsuit was unsealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| When did you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Can you bring your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| When did you get the lawsuit, John, even though it was under seal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Oh, several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| And when it's under seal, that's exactly what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| I just wondered how long you had known about it, the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| Well, I've known about the lawsuit since shortly after, you know, it was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| It was filed under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| How long was this contract for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| How long was the contract for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| We gave them a contract for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Was it a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| From January 2003 to July, no, to June of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Five and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| The first year, I believe, was a partial year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| And then we've had, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Why was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Who put it under seal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I mean, it's public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| In an open government, you would think who in the world would have sealed taxpayer dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| I could say we don't try our lawsuits on this floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| But the nature of this proceeding is that these lawsuits are filed under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| Yeah, but who made the first filing for it to be under seal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I don't think that violates the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| The lawsuit was filed by Mr. Mays through his attorney, David Wiggler, who is the associate of Herb Moncier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| So the lawsuit was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| It has now been unsealed, and we're going about the process of evaluating the claims made in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| That is all we are able to tell you at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Now, in 30 days, we'll be glad to provide you with an update, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| which would also give Natural Resources Recovery the opportunity to present their side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3160)|
| 0:52:51| You've heard Mr. Mays' side tonight in no uncertain terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| And but you haven't heard from Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| You also haven't heard from Knox County's directors based on how they've been dealing with this contract for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3184)|
| 0:53:20| And there is a, there's certainly evidence there that is going to be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| But none of that has been brought to this, to the floor of this body yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| But we can certainly start fleshing that out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| But, you know, this is not a trial of this case before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| We are in court to deal with the issues in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| Now, if it, if Knox County decides to continue with the prosecution of this case against Natural Resources Recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3228)|
| 0:54:07| you'll be the first to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Well, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| And do we have any other contracts that are under seal and are out of compliance that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| If it's under seal, he wouldn't be able to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Do we have any other contracts that we know of that's out of compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| Oh, it's up to department directors to monitor their contracts to determine if they are being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| if the terms are being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| So I wouldn't be able to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| We've got to, Mr. King, you want to say anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| I was just going to say and suggest to this body if there is serious suggestion that at next month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3283)|
| 0:54:52| this body is going to deal with the suggestion that this contract be terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| you might want to prepare for an extra long meeting so that all your questions get dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| There's a lot of technical information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| And I hadn't quite assumed that I was going to need to have all of the engineering expertise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| I believe now I may just ask them to come on if you all want to sit down and have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| We'll just sit down and have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Mr. Law Director, if we decide that since the contract is going to be up here at the end of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| how long do we need as far as if we're going to put this out to bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| How much time would we need to allow for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Would that just be someone from the administration bringing it forward that they're going to put out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| Or how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| And I was looking at Hugh Holt, our purchasing director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| and I believe he's indicating probably 30 days would be the typical run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| A minimum of 21 business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| If you're looking at a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Is there a motion on the floor to defer until next month with the administration coming back with the figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| and stuff like that for the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| To all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| Resolution 916 is asking the Knox County Department of Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| and Recreation and the Knox County Engineering and Public Works Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| to develop a policy regarding political signage as it relates to Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Voted 5-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Can we take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Well, let's take care of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| We'll take care of this one and then take care of it and have a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| I'll make the motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| What I'm trying to do with this, I believe we need to be consistent about our rules for signage at public locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3423)|
| 0:57:15| We recently have had a situation where they're using parks and recreation facilities for polling places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| I don't necessarily think that's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| I don't think that it's a good idea to have elections going on in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| and it's going to be especially a bad idea when the next election comes up when the parks are actually in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| But if we're going to be using parks as polling places for early voting, and you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| If you're voting early, that day is election day for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| and the candidates have a right to attempt to influence your opinion with signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| And so I believe that if we are going to have a park being used as a polling place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| that we need to respect people's rights to free speech, to put up their signs, the same as we do on election day at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3483)|
| 0:58:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Commissioner Lambert, considering where we're at with the early voting is going to be over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| I think Thursday is the last day for early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| I don't think we're going to be able to change what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| The next time we're going to be voting is going to be in August or I guess maybe July for the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3509)|
| 0:58:38| That's the time I'm really concerned about because in July these parks are going to be under heavy use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| Could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| You want me to withdraw it and bring it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| You could bring it back next month or another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| You know, maybe give the law department a chance to draw something up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| talk to Greg McKay with the election commission and see what he would suggest and maybe some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| and then bring something back before so that we're a little more prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Why don't you just defer it until next month and if Doug Patel is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| maybe get with the library people because I know we're early voting at libraries now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| and see if there's some kind of system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| And they're doing it at some of the substations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| See, I wish we could just tell the election commission they can't set up polling places in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| because I understand Doug's issue with having all those signs put up in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| But, unfortunately, we don't have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| The election commission can put a polling place in any public building they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| And so since we don't have that choice, I think we need to treat any polling place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| even if it's in a park, exactly the same and allow the signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Are you going to make a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| I'm making the motion that we defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| For 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| The next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| The next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| But in the meantime, you want them to come with a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| I want them to get together and try to work on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Do you all want to take a five-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I ain't going to say five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| I was going to say more than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Short break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| All right, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| 917, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| This is to amend the fiscal year 2007-2008 Knox County budget to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| remove the Knox County mayor's miscellaneous expense allowance fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Account number 9195-0000 bringing its balance to zero and thereby shifting said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3643)|

| 1:01:05| 3-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3665)|

| 1:01:08| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Second by Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Mr. Troyer, I asked for some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| So can you explain to us tonight the information I asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| You should have a memo passed out with the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| The first item is the amount that's under number 8806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| There was amendments to the proposed budget that included the amounts of $500 for people who earn under $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3699)|
| 1:01:51| Let me just go back to the memo here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| Now, John, are you telling me that this commission approved a budget for 07-08 that included $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| for miscellaneous expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I would like for you, like I said once before, tomorrow if you'll show me because in my book that I have at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| shows it as auto allowance in the mayor's office administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| It says auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Yeah, that was the descriptor, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| And I think we had a lengthy discussion at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| At the time, we wanted to show a better description of this and that we are a better description of this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| You said we had a discussion, a discussion in public, or did you have a discussion somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| At the budget hearings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Jolie, tomorrow get the clerk to get the tapes of the budget meeting and Mr. Troyer and see if you all can find it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3772)|
| 1:03:02| in the tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Also, I talked to you about the last meeting about the other people in the office that received auto allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3784)|
| 1:03:14| And I asked for you to bring where in the budget in the line item and show me where that money was coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| and where it was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Yeah, it's addressed in the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| No, John, it isn't addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| It's addressed on a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| I'm wanting to see the budget, the proposed budget that you all asked us to pass in the line item of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3811)|
| 1:03:42| And then what we did pass as a budget because the mayor and one other person in his office was the only one that was line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3822)|
| 1:03:53| So there were several other people getting that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| So it had to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| Now, where did that money come from in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| At committee what we discussed and one of the things that we discussed is what was in the proposed 2007-2008 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| And the only one that was in the proposed budget was the mayor's $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| No, I think in probation they had that auto allowance in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Yeah, but we're talking about just the mayor's office, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| But then I asked you in committees to bring everyone else that had received an auto allowance where it was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| where it was proposed in the budget because it clearly had to be proposed somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| And it's in your memo that it was not in the proposed budget for the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| No, for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| People were in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Do you know the people in the mayor's office received auto allowances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Mr. Vanderveet and some other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| I mean, do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| It was my understanding at committee meeting that we were talking about the 2007-2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| No, John, I told you to go back because that was the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| And I said, go back if you would and show me where that money was proposed in the budget to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| And to show me where it was going to, you said, well, it never got added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| So if it didn't get added for this year, it should be a minus somewhere or a reduction in a line item somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| But the year before that we talked about that it did get paid and it was not in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| So it had to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| And I believe you told me that it came from like positions not being filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| Is that where it came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| What we've got is we've got two different fiscal years and two different things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| Okay, we know this year that some people in the mayor's office did not receive that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| I don't know what you call it, a pay raise, bonus, car allowance or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| So the year they did receive it, can you show me in the budget where it was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3960)|
| 1:06:10| If you look at the memo that was provided today in the 2006-2007 year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| the allowances were paid from the salary and benefits of the 1003310 accounting unit, the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| The mayor was within his budget that was approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| It's not specific items, but he stayed within his budget that was approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Is that the policy of this government and the policy of this administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| If they have money left in salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| they can spend it ever how they want without coming to commission for line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| Did you get a line item transfer for that funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| You asked several different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Well, let's start with the one that should be the easiest, a yes or no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Did you all get a line item transfer from this commission to spend salary money for auto allowances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| Not for specifically that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| But the mayor did stay within the allowed budget for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| It's been a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| It's been provided to Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| It's been provided to the outside auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| And it's been a matter of discussion already before this full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Is this the policy of Knox County government of how every office conducts themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| Is this the policy of your administration in Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| What policy are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| I mean, clearly we should have some kind of rules or policies that say if you're moving money from a salary account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4062)|
| 1:07:52| and you're going to pay them for auto allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| that you should do what everybody approves every month on the finance committee is a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| Or you're saying as long as you stay within the whole realm of the total budget, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| You don't have to come back and ask for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| In the budget resolution that's adopted by this body, there's parameters that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| And those parameters include the general broad descriptions of personal services, benefits, contracted services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| materials, debt service, and other charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| And the mayor stayed within those parameters that were outlined in the budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| You're saying you stayed within what is the parameters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| You had to be in a certain account number, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| About the 100s, 200s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Yeah, those are the ones, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| So you're saying you stayed within the policy by doing what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| As the finance director of Knox County, you're telling me that the guidelines were followed to the T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| As the finance director, I'm saying the mayor stayed within the budget that was adopted by this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| That's not the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| I'm saying did you follow policy and your accounting rules as the finance director of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| is that the proper way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| I'm still not clear about how you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Okay, say another office, not the administration, but another office being all this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| And as long as they had $2 million left in their budget, they could buy whatever they wanted, boats, cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| But they stayed within their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| Is that a permissible use of taxpayer funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| The way that this works is the county commission approves the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and then each officeholder spends money according to that budget, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| The way the budget is listed is personal services, benefits, contracted services, supplies and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4188)|
| 1:09:57| debt service and other charges, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| The mayor stayed within those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| So you're saying as an accountant and the finance director of Knox County that's the proper way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| The proper way to do to get your auto allowance, you take it out of salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Is that the proper way to do it without getting a line item transfer that we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| If we're not going to follow the line item transfers, why do we do it every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Okay, now we've had some discussion and there was a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| including a memo from Mr. VandeVate to this commission last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| And there was plenty of discussion about how that was classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| The classifications were changed and eventually that these were stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| And so right now we're not paying these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| And Mr. Troy, I'm not worried about, I know we're not paying them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| I'm just saying, once again, I'm trying to get you on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| If you're saying everything was followed by the procedures of this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| and the policies of this administration in the way these auto allowances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| slash bonuses, slash supplements, whatever you call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| it was done according to the policy and the rules and the charter of this county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| There were concerns that Mr. Wallace has raised in his audit that were brought before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| We responded to those concerns in a meeting before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| And I think those concerns were aired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Well, a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Are you saying, as the finance director of Knox County government, everything was done okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4302)|
| 1:11:54| What I'm saying is that the mayor said within his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| I just want a yes or no answer if I can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Was the policies and everything that we go by in Knox County government, was it followed, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| Procedurally, it could have been done better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| So what's that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| What would you have done different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| What would you have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| I think the issue today is the current year because the item that you have on the agenda tonight is about the 2007-2008 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4335)|
| 1:12:24| The item that you have before you is about the proposal to amend the 2007-2008 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| There is no budget for anyone else besides the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| And the item that you have on your agenda tonight relates to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| But can you address what we talked about when everyone did receive it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| We're trying to get two things cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| You're not going according to your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| You can add it again next month if you'd like for me to add that going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| So tonight we'll deal with this other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| And we've got a motion to zero out this account for the remainder of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4379)|
| 1:13:08| And I think we've got a motion and a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| This is a question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| The internal auditor provided us with a report on the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| And in that report, he asked that the law director be consulted with regards to certain items on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| And I believe that you were asked to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| And so can you tell us your feeling about the travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| And I don't know if you talked to the comptroller or not, but just in your investigation of how you've looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| is Mr. Vanderveet and others' travel allowance proper, improper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| Do we need to take further action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I can't tell you that tonight, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| Quite frankly, the report was done many months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| But I believe there are still a number of unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| And I am still seeking information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| I'm still getting information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| I have talked with the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| I talked with Richard Norman, Jim Arnett, and David Sturdivant, all in the comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| within the past couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| And we had a lengthy discussion about the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:37| And that's where I need to leave it for now because we are still waiting on other documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| What you have before you tonight is a reduction in one account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4486)|
| 1:14:55| So the question becomes, and why you have this before you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| what was the intent of the Knox County Commission when it passed its budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| And we went over the budgets going all the way back to the Dwight Kessel era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4503)|
| 1:15:13| Dwight Kessel was provided with what we would term a car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| He also had a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| It was noted in the budget as other per diem fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| It was $12,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| That went on for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| It went on through the Tommy Shumpert administration, and it went into Mayor Ragsdale's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4532)|
| 1:15:40| It stayed as other per diem fees within the budget, always approved by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| until we got to the 2004 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4547)|
| 1:15:55| It was still other per diem fees, but it increased to $16,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| When was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| It looks like it was, I've got accounting period 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| And then we went into the 2005 accounting period, and it was changed to $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4570)|
| 1:16:20| still classified as other per diem fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| We went into the June, the 2006 budget year, and it was changed to auto allowance for $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4585)|
| 1:16:38| It was still auto allowance in the 2007 year, but then we have had an additional change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4598)|
| 1:16:48| John Troyer, you can enlighten us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Now it is called, the title of the account is miscellaneous expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| I reported that accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| And so what is or what was the intent of this commission when it passed its budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| Some of our unanswered questions are going back to see just what John just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| What were these matters discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| And if they were, what was said and what was the intent of the commission when it was passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| I don't know what the intent of this body was when the budget was passed, but I do know what I see in the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| Now, if it wasn't the intent of this commission to provide the Knox County mayor with both a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| and a car allowance or a per diem allowance or any way you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| then what you have before you is a resolution to bring that account balance to zero for the remainder of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4666)|
| 1:17:55| You have it within your powers as the Knox County Commission to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| Can I ask real quick, John, the line item number, when it was called per diem or additional per whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4682)|
| 1:18:13| is it the same line item number when it was called travel or did that number change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| We're at 5199.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| So the 100 level, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| And we changed computer systems and we changed our accounting number structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| And we did that in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| And that's when, so the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| So then we were at the 250 or the 200 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| It was 9250 in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| And we were still at the 200 level in 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| But now, as a result, it looks like of the budget adopted in June of 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| we're back to the 100 level, classifying this as a miscellaneous expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4735)|
| 1:19:03| So it changed from a 100 level to a 200 level, is that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| For two years and then back to the 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I think the 100 level is the best description and the most correct way to categorize it, and that's where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| Well, John, would you say, I know you weren't the finance director those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| but are you trying to tell us that it was just simply mislabeled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4763)|
| 1:19:33| I think the, when we changed computer systems, that the mayor's expense allowance was not considered individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4773)|
| 1:19:41| And, yes, I think it was mislabeled as a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| And I think it never should have been called that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| I think it should have been called an expense allowance all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| Just for clarification, Mr. Law Director, if I'm understanding you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| you're saying that the intent of the county commission apparently was to go ahead and provide these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| But if we're saying now it was not our intent, then we can come in and take them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| Certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| You can amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| It is within your power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| Commissioner Smith, you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Or Commissioner Pinkson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| I have a question for Law Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| Are they trying to tell us in a sort of like a school board thing is we give them so much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| and they just can't spend over it and they're, is that what they're trying to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| As far as coming back to this body for line item changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| it's my understanding that the policy of the administration is that if you're within the 100 levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| and you wish to shift monies to a 200 level, for instance, then you've got to come back to this body to get a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| Is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| If you're within the 100 levels, then the, it is within the discretion of the official to shift those monies around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| within their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| So you may have a person or two that leaves your department, so it wouldn't necessarily be salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| You could shift that to other benefit type arrangements if that's within that 100 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4878)|
| 1:21:29| It's only when you shift the levels that you come before this body for permission to do line item changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4889)|
| 1:21:38| Did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| John says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| You got it, did it shift from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Oh, I don't see that the commission has, I mean, we don't, I don't have line item changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| I don't have, I don't have a line item change sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| But from what I understand, it wasn't changed, it was just relabeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4917)|
| 1:22:07| And then I guess the one last question I've got, Mr. Troy, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| In your mind, doing this, were you comfortable with what you were doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| I'm not saying anybody asked you to do anything illegal or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| but the bookkeeping things, were you comfortable thinking that you could, down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| and always justify wherever it came from and it was still within the lines and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| The mayor's allowance, there's been a long history of the county providing an allowance for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| and the mayor stayed within his budget as allowed by this county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| Okay, let me just follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| What is the expense account for the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4960)|
| 1:22:51| So, what are you asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| How much money does the mayor have in his office to spend on whatever he chooses to spend it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| Buying a table at a non-profit or doing whatever he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| How much money does he have in his office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Well, the mayor's got two opportunities that have been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| The first one is the expense allowance that we're talking about tonight, and that was $20,000, well documented, 8806 left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| And that's one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| And the other piece is that was approved by this body was $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| So, did Mr. Shumpert and Mr. Kessel have $70,000 to spend or was it $10,000 and $12,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5005)|
| 1:23:35| Each year the mayor proposes and each year the commission adopts a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| And in this particular budget year, the budget included $20,000 for the mayor's and a $50,000 line item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5020)|
| 1:23:48| two different line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| So, I can tell you what my intent was when I approved the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| I approved the budget giving him a $50,000 expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| And me and Mr. Ragsdale had this conversation the day of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| Do you remember it, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| I remember talking about several things, but I think you knew exactly what you voted on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| I haven't lobbied any of you during this conversation one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| I haven't talked to a single one of you about it because when you take a job in public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| I don't think it's about the amount of money you earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| You know what that is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| On the other hand, I think deep down we all know what this is about, each and every one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| People watching on television know what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| So, we knew exactly where it was going, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| And I think this is just one more step in what we've seen, sadly, happen over the past several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| Again, I didn't lobby a single one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| I didn't make a single call to any of you, nor do I plan on saying anything else further about it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| Well, we did have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| And you had a conversation with many commissioners that day, one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| And we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| And you said, what do you want me to do with mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| I said, I want you to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| And I don't think that's correct, Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Well, we've said enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| And it's up to this body to decide what they thought they were approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| If they want to give you $70,000 to spend, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| I thought I was giving you $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| I think that's plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| So, we've still got some lights on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| John, you're talking about Tommy Shumpert and Dwight Kessel had a $12,000 deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| Cash practice, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Cash practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| What did they use this money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| Well, they had to get into my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| They had automobiles, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| They used the money for travel, I believe, for other expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| And they used them as an accountable, in an accountable fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| So, for IRS purposes, you could take your receipts, you could reduce that $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| But what you had left at the end of the year, if you had a balance, say it was $3,000 or $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5171)|
| 1:26:19| it was converted to salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| I'm going to buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| Now, I checked out Dwight Kessel and Tommy Shumpert both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| They turned in receipts for the money that they spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Some months there was none turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| They didn't even apply for any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Now, we know it was used for expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Now, what was the $20,000 that the mayor got used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| And we heard the finance director, Troyer's boss, stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| and it changed three times in less than three minutes on what that money was worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| What was it used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| I think it started out in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| In the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| And there were expenses that were made and receipts that were counted against the $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5220)|
| 1:27:08| It was an accountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| Now, I believe it's been converted to an unaccountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| According to the IRS definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| And what you're saying is they're using this for expenses like when they travel and do things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| I believe that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Well, if they're using that for the expenses of travel, why did they have a credit card to charge all their expenses on too then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5248)|
| 1:27:38| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| I want a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| You would have to ask the mayor and Mr. Troyer if that is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| I think, I know it's been discussed here many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| There's still a P-card audit that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| I'm not talking about an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| I don't want to get into that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| We know that's coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| But what I'm asking you is, as a law director, how can I give you an expense account and you take that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| put it in your pocket, do whatever you want to with it, and then still charge me for the expenses on a credit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5294)|
| 1:28:22| Would that not be illegal in your, as you as a law director, would you not think that's illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| I don't have an opinion on that tonight, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| Like I say, there is still an audit that is being performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| And I think the P-card audit somehow, because of just what you're asking, is related to the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| At this meeting here on June the 7th, we talked about the P-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| I believe it was May the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| We talked about the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| John Warner, we asked him what it was for, and he said that's for miscellaneous expenses when we go out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5340)|
| 1:29:09| to pay for things that are inappropriate, such as cigars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| So then I asked him what they were using the credit cards for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| It seemed like it was fraud to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| And he said, well, it's used for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| So we asked him if they got a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| We asked him why it was used for that, why they got a car and their gas furnished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| And then it went from that to a salary supplement, the way they supplemented their salary here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| And this is all documented on this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| I may have the dates wrong on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| So, you know, this is John's boss that set all this up at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| and he didn't even apparently know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| All right, now, he was caught, himself, using these P-cards and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| buying things for his own personal use, such as clothes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| We've seen the abuses in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| But I just don't know how we can give anybody an expense account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| and then them take a credit card and charge all their expenses to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| That may be one of the reasons this resolution is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| It's whatever the intent of this commission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Well, then you get into this when you come into salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| Only two people in that, you know, and it's odd that both of them came out of the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| reported it on their W-2s as income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| The rest of them did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| There was no income tax paid on it, no Social Security withheld, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| Now, they've amended that, they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| But now some of these travel allowances you go back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| they go back as far as 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| They weren't quite that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| But it came out of payroll on their check, regular pay, and travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| We're talking back as far as 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| And still they had these cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| So, you know, this doesn't pass the smell test to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| It seems to me like the law director, I mean the auditor said in this report on this travel thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| that this was done either improper, either as disguised compensation or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| You know, we question them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| You know, if you call up here and ask Paul Pinkston's salary, they're supposed to give it if you're a citizen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| If you called up here and got their salary, you wouldn't know about all these supplements to their pay, which was bogus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5499)|
| 1:31:47| Now, I just don't see, and like I say, I'm not a lawyer, but I don't see how anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| any commissioner up here can sit up here and say this is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| and defend it by saying, well, it come out of this account into that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| Now, being on the finance committee, like most of us are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| if the sheriff does not fill the positions that we allocate the money for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| he has to come up here and ask for that money to be given for another project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5534)|
| 1:32:21| A line item transfer is what we call that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| Now, why would the mayor's office or anybody else be exempt from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| I'm reading this thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| It says that he's come out of the salaries and benefits from the, you know, that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| Why do they not have to come and ask for a line item transfer like the sheriff's department and these other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| They would if you are switching from the different levels, from the 100s, the 200s, the 300s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| Then you have to ask for your line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| You have to go from the 100 to the 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| In the 2006 and 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| You may need to ask your accountant this, but that's the way I understand it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| Did you ask for a line item transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| There was not a need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Beg your pardon, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| There was not a need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| The mayor stayed within his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Oh, then what you're saying is if we approve a budget for X amount of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| and you give it to me for what you need this money for and you don't use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| you can just spend it any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| I think that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| I think that once, as long as we stay within the categories approved, same as any other office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| the county commission approves the budget, the office holders spend the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| and it's their obligation to spend it within the budget that's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| Some of the transfers that you've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| there have been occasions where the sheriff takes an unfilled position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| And like, for instance, in this past month, there was an increase in gas prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| and asked for some money to be transferred from salaries to the gasoline line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| Gas prices are higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Mine is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| That's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| But if he could do that, he's still within his budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| why did he have to come up here and ask for the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| Because the prevailing document that we use is the budget resolution that's adopted by this county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5653)|
| 1:34:21| And on the budget resolution that's adopted by this county commission is a provision that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| that anything within the broad categories of personal services, benefits, contracted services, supplies and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5667)|
| 1:34:34| debt service and other, that those are the broad categories that we use for line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| Things within those broad categories are, that's where we have the approval level of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5680)|
| 1:34:48| And so things within those broad categories are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| Richard, this question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| You're our auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Is that proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| When we did our work, we felt it was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| And I think if you read our report, you'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| Well, you know, I've read that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| Matter of fact is I think I had you to read it back to me up here one night at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| And everything in that stated it was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| And I believe, now you correct me if I'm wrong, you did not do this audit by yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| Even the state comptroller helped you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| We did most of the work and they assisted us in the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| In other words, we're saying the state comptroller and you both think this was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| I think that would be a correct statement, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| I'd just like to add that there were several items that when we went through the details of this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| before the full commission that the administration agreed with Mr. Walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| and several of his recommendations and several of his recommendations were implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5760)|
| 1:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| Commissioner, that before or after the fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| I think during the audit and after the audit, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| But not before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| I mean, all this is after you got caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| That's when you implemented these safeguards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Yes, many were after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| John Troyer, could you explain the difference between the 50,000 expense and the 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5799)|
| 1:36:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Two different pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Right now, the 50,000 is for the benefit of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| The 20,000 is really within the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| It's considered income on the mayor's W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| The 20,000 is for personal expenses that the mayor incurs in the discharge of his duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5827)|
| 1:37:16| The 50,000 is considered many things like when he buys a table at a charity event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| or there was $13,000 at Beaumont Elementary that he gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| There was an event in Center City that he helped sponsor for $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| There was a Tech 2020 event that he helped sponsor for $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| And so it's for the benefit of the county and not for the benefit of him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| And I think there's a differentiation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| In order for that money to be tapped or paid out, what has to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| For the $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| It's the mayor's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Mayor's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Does some type of receipt or some type of documentation showing that that's where it's going to must be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5879)|
| 1:38:07| and then the county, I guess, cuts a check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Well, they don't cut a check to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| I'm saying to whoever the recipient is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Like I know that we cut one to Beaumont Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| We knew that we cut a check to Technology 2020 to sponsor an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| I mean, we cut a check to Center City Events to sponsor an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| So it's not a benefit to the mayor personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| It's just a benefit out there for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| For the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| And it's very much the same as the commissioners use their discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| It's that the mayor decides what events and what items he wants to sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| the same way that the county commissioners decide how to spend their discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| So you just put in a request to the finance department asking that your department cut a check to, say, this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5933)|
| 1:39:04| or that organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| And the 20 is simply for his expenses in carrying out his duties as mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| Personally, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| And it's included on his W-2 and it's for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| So it's treated as income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Commissioner Strickland has got his slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| I clearly remember what the $20,000 is used for should be income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| And I also remember the $50,000 that we approved because, if you remember, last year we gave him $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5975)|
| 1:39:45| We cut it down to $50,000, if you remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| I have a question, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| I was looking at the P-card report that we get every month now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| And I saw where the mayor spent $200-something for the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| Now, where did that money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Is that separate than that $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| I mean, I saw where he spent on that report $220, $230, whatever it was, wasn't much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| Chances are that was to Office Depot and chances are that was for supplies and materials for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| I couldn't tell you exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| I do know that right now the mayor's P-card has been deactivated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| and it has been reissued to an employee of the mayor's office just for mayor's office operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| And that's the intent is to only use that for buying supplies and materials for the office operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| But I did see the $200-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| And there's still charges and that's going to be charged to his office supply line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| Okay, John, just so I understand it, the $20,000, where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| How does he get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| $20,000 is included in each paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| Okay, what would that be out, each paycheck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Basically, how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| Whatever $20,000 is divided by 26 paychecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| Close to $800?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Less taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| $769.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| So he gets $769 a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| Most of our employees don't even make $769 a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| And I believe the resolution for the mayor's salary to be set, it has to be set by a resolution of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| So why would that not just be put into a salary instead of trying to go this way to get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6094)|
| 1:41:43| I think you have a resolution before you that you can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6103)|
| 1:41:52| Commissioner Pinkston, then I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| John, now you correct me if I'm wrong on what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| You said this $20,000 was part of his salary, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| It's included on his W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Did you say that was part of his salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| I think that's to compensate him for the expenses that he incurs by being mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| Well, how does he incur any expenses when he's paying them for them with his pay card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| But let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| What is the mayor's salary, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| I would hate to quote that without looking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| Well, if I recall, I thought it was $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| $148,000 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| I thought it was $140,000 and then in $1 because by a charter he is to be the highest paid elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| And I thought our judges were paid $140,000 and I thought they added $1 to his to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| I believe he has to make 5% more than any elected constitutional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Is that not the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| I'm not going to argue that point because I haven't studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| But if this was his salary, why did they not pay taxes on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| Why was it not reported on a W-2 until we called him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| Now, you've gone back, you said, and amended this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| Yeah, we've gone back and amended five W-2s for the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| and we've gone back and amended everything in accordance with the IRS regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| and it's all been reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Now, who paid the Social Security on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| Employees paid their portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| The county paid its portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| When we voted on this budget down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| now you're saying this $20,000 is part of his salary because now it's reported on his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| when he's filing the W-2 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| I think it's a part of his income or benefit of being the mayor is to compensate him for cost of being the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6235)|
| 1:44:05| Well, I didn't vote on that for a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| I don't think anybody here did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| You know, I thought we, when we voted on the budget, I thought we voted, I believe it was $148,000 a year for salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| Mr. Mayor, you're shaking your head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| I don't think that's the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| I think your number's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| Well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| But we didn't vote on the $160,000, did we, for your salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| Mr. Pinkston, you and I sat in my office and discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| You know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| We all know what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Again, I'm not going to lobby you one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I'm not asking you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| No, I'd like to finish, sir, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Each and every one of us know what this is about this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| It's no secret to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| It's no secret to those watching on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| And, again, I'm not going to lobby you one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| So vote as you think is best and use your own conscience and judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| I would like you to tell me what it's about because I guess I'm the most ignorant person up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| I think it's about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| What do you think it's about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| I think it's about taking county money inappropriately is what I think it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| Now, what do you think it's about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Mr. Pinkston, you know that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| Everyone since Mr. Kessler has gotten this same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| And if you want to change it, that's your prerogative to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| But vote as you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| Did you turn in the Mr. Kessler got this $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| You're getting $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| I'm not going to argue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Did you turn in receipts on your $20,000 like Mr. Kessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| I claim more than $20,000 in expenses every year and I do it with the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| But do you turn in receipts to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| No, and I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| It's not calculated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Well, Mr. Kessler did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| So did Mr. Shumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| So it must be a different thing you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| We've got a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| I get a salary with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| I get also a car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| I got $6,000 car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| The regulation with the IRS says that $6,000 is income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| I have to pay taxes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| So I don't have a problem with that $20,000 a year to pay taxes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| I mean, it's all under IRS guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| It's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| Commissioner Strickland, these other county executives got $12,000 at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6379)|
| 1:46:27| This is $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Scott, we approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| I don't know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| We approved it in the 7-0-8-0-9 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| I approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| If we want to cut it out, we need to cut it out to zero or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Let's just vote, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| We did approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| We did approve it, but I approved it as an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| And I can show you in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| I get an auto allowance, and it still goes under income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Did you get a car furnished to you, Mr. Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| Well, that's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Well, I understand what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| And, Mr. Strickland, yours has been reported with the city finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| payroll department, I'd say, as income every year, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Well, this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| I know they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| This wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| I understand everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| You know, we haven't said going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| And that may be coming back in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| But Mr. Owens said he'd have that audit for us ready to go tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| It'd be off his desk this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| So I think going forward, we owe it to the citizens of Aucus County to know that we're accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| We're going to hold people accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| And when we got employees out here working two jobs, and they're not bringing home $769 a paycheck from this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6445)|
| 1:47:33| and they're having to go work another job somewhere to take care of their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| and we're providing people with a car, the $20,000 and $140,000, whatever it is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| And we approved it as an auto allowance in the budget because I looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| Now, if somebody thinks they deserve $160,000 or $170,000, whatever it is, just bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| We spent millions of dollars getting this pay plan that we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6474)|
| 1:48:02| So if they deserve it, rewrite the pay scale, and you turn it to HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| and they'll grade it and come back with the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| That's what we do for the employees in the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| You know, I'm not a CPA commissioner more or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| but we've got the state comptroller and the county auditor both saying this was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| I think everybody knows how they're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| So can you all keep it short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| Commissioner Smith, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| Tank, go back to Tank and for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Tank, you said we had them last year with $800,000 and reduced it down to $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| Well, I don't know if we had them there, but that's what he spent last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| And this $50,000, John, that we give to the mayor, that's for tables and stuff and for non-profits per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| And it's nothing to do with the mayor personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| And I'm like Mr. Pinkston, I wish I was a CPA and I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| So if we give him $50,000 that he has to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| and if he doesn't use that at the end of the year, that money just he doesn't take that in the salary, does he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| No, it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| It goes back to the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| It goes back to the general fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| And then the $20,000 that we've talked about is the same thing what the other guys got, $12,000 they got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| compared to his $20,000 at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| If Shumpert had money at the end of the year from his $12,000, if he had an extra $2,000, he got to take that as income, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| And this current mayor is choosing, there's two paths offered by the IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| and he's choosing a different path that's offered by the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| And he's paying taxes as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| And he's keeping his receipts between him and the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| And the county is left out of that loop and just reporting that income as he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| You know, I'm not an auditor or CPA, but he explained it to me, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Can we split these two up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Because it looks to me like we've got two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| We've got the $50,000 in discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| That's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| That's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| That's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| This is just the car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Just the car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| I was just going to say, I remember confusion over the car allowance, but I remember voting for $50,000 in discretionary spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| I think we need to come up with a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| This doesn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| The mayor's $50,000 in the discretionary funds that we have, that anything that any of us give over $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6622)|
| 1:50:30| we need to come to this commission and get approval on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| We don't get $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| I think you've said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| I was going to say that I said the IRS and the $50,000 at the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Anything we spend over $1,000, we need to come through this commission and get prior approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| I believe that's the way city council does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| I thought you accidentally said we got $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Get $10 with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| You have to come for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| We need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6659)|

| 1:53:58| On 101 Stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| Are we on the Stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| No, 101 is not the Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Oh, which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| We're on 101 first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| We're on 101 second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| 101 is almost failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| That's what Commissioner Norman gave the intergovernmental report for 101 first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6857)|
| 1:54:27| But that's the one I'm recusing myself from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Is that what was written in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Yeah, number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| No, I was just going to say I've read the room and I understand that this is not going to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| even though I feel strongly about it and feel the citizens should vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| So, I'm not going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| If someone else would like to, again, I think I've read the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| I'll make a motion to withdraw it from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| Substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Do we have a second to substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| We're ready to vote it up or down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Remember what state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| You know, we've talked about people taking money tonight and then we're trying to limit who's running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6914)|
| 1:55:24| I think the state legislature dealt with it last year and said it was a campaign issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| People in Knox County, if they decide they want to elect someone that serves on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| when I came on county commission, we had four or five school teachers on here my first year in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| And we've had many people who work for the government that serves on these commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| And, you know, the people you say you want them to have a right to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| they're going to February the 5th because there's some candidates out there running that are county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| And they'll get to vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| So, Commissioner Lambert, and then we'll come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| I just want to say I think this is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| I think a person has a right to run for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| And I think the people have a right to decide that's an issue if they choose to, if a person is running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6970)|
| 1:56:17| And, Mr. Norman, you ran for office and at the time you were a school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| And I believe everyone knew that you were a school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| In fact, if I remember, you were very proud of the work that you had done as a school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| And I think that the people had every right to elect you to the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| If we start going along, second of all, in light of all the controversies that we've had in this government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=6999)|
| 1:56:49| if we want to start saying, you know, making people ineligible to serve, why not take city employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| We've got an awful lot of city employees who serve on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| Why not make people who have sat on boards that receive grant money from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| Boy, we've had some big scandals there, you know, about grants that were inappropriately given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| Why not just say that if you've ever sat on a non-profit board that received grant money from Knox County, that you're ineligible to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7034)|
| 1:57:22| If we start going down this path, where does it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| And who left is going to be eligible to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Now, I think that we've had some problems in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| And I think that we need to work toward building public confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| But I don't believe that we do that by doing the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| I don't believe that we build public confidence by denying someone the right to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7063)|
| 1:57:52| I just think that's the wrong thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| And that's why I'm supporting, you know, I believe that we should deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| And I'd like to ask some of the folks on here who work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| Mr. Leuthold, I know you don't intend to vote on this, but did you disclose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| and did you let people know that you work for Knox County when you ran?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| Most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| Do you believe that you have served in an appropriate way on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| And do you believe that it has affected, that your work with Knox County has affected the decisions that you've made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7099)|
| 1:58:27| Well, I would prefer to stay out of the conversation, but I've always voted my conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7107)|
| 1:58:36| And the voters sent me back here with about 77 percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7123)|
| 1:58:43| And, Mr. Norman, I'd like to ask you, do you believe that it was appropriate for you to run for office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7123)|
| 1:58:52| Yes, I think it was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| And I think all of the people that most likely most of the people that voted for me knew that I was a teacher in the public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7134)|
| 1:59:05| Has the fact that you were a teacher affected your votes since you've been on county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| Not in the same way as Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I think that as I have, I've tried to vote my conscience, and as I will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7153)|
| 1:59:22| And I think your point is well taken in part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| But my issue about this particular item is not that it's constitutional or unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7167)|
| 1:59:36| It is that the question is, is it helpful for Knox County at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| And on that basis, I would say it may be helpful to reinstill some sense of trust in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7183)|
| 1:59:54| And, therefore, I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Do you believe it was the right thing for you to do, to run for office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| And do you believe that you are serving with honor on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Then why would you think that it was the right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| And I understand, you know, we have got some bad press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| I understand you want to do something to reinstill trust in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| But should we do the wrong thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| And if you think that it's wrong for Knox County employees to run for office, and if you think it's wrong for Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| to serve on this board, then, sir, you need to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| Because when you ran for this office, you were a Knox County employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| If you think it's wrong for Knox County employees to serve, and especially since you were drawing a pension from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| then you need to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| Now, I don't think it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| I don't think it's wrong for you to seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| I do not think it was wrong for you to seek office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Now, me and you have disagreed on a good many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| But I believe that you have served with honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| I believe that you have voted your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| I do not believe that your votes were ever swayed by the fact that you worked for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7260)|
| 2:01:07| And I also don't believe that you or anybody on this body should deny other folks the right to run for the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7267)|
| 2:01:17| simply because they're employed for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| I believe that we have a long tradition of Knox County employees serving with honor on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7281)|
| 2:01:28| I believe that the temporary situation that we have over some public mistrust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| I do not believe that we fix that by doing the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| And I do believe it would be the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| I believe it would be the wrong thing for you to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| But I believe that if you vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| and if you believe that it is appropriate to ban Knox County employees from running for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| and holding office, then, sir, I am asking you to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| Because if you're saying that running for this office was inappropriate, serving in this capacity is inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| then I say if you vote yes for this, don't be a hypocrite and resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| But I hope you'll vote no and I hope you'll stay because you bring a lot to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| I would like to respond since a lot of that was addressed to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| I agree with a lot of what you have to say, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| I think that somewhat we live in such a different time since January 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| that it's probably not going to be necessary to exclude county employees anymore from holding public office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7351)|
| 2:02:40| because the idea that the voters are going to be so well-informed about who's running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7360)|
| 2:02:50| and what their real intentions are that I really do feel like it probably would be unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| It's a little bit redundant to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| But, again, I feel by making the choice that I do, I am not voting to exclude anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| I'm voting to allow the voters to make the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| And so that's all I intend to do is allow them to make the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| And I think absolutely that they will be perfectly aware of who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7397)|
| 2:03:25| or who is not a county employee if it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| And they will make decisions and the decisions that they'll make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| they'll feel like they can trust the people that they're voting for as they did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| That's what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| You know, we have to be very careful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| You know, we're not taking the voters' rights away by voting no against this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| They still have the right to vote against you if you're a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| But you don't make things right by taking someone else's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| And we're taking rights away from people in this county if we vote yes for this, the right to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| And what we're saying is that the people of Knox County don't know who to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7452)|
| 2:04:20| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| They don't have sense enough to vote for a guy if he works for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| Well, you know, in some cases, these people that run for the county, they look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| and they think, well, they're the best candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| They're the one I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| So we're taking their rights away, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| The right of the voter and the right of the candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| Now, I've got trust in the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| Now, here I think they'll make the right decision on this when they go to the polls February the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| We're going against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| We're going against the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| We're going against everything that the state of Tennessee says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| These people have the right to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| We are violating their rights by sitting up here and saying, well, they shouldn't be allowed to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| Let the people decide that at the polls, like Commissioner Moore said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| February the 5th, if there's any county employees out there running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| then if they want to elect them, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| If they want to vote against them, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| That's the voter's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| But where will this stop at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| We've got one commissioner sitting here that works for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| Maybe next it's them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| We've got one that works for the news media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Maybe it's him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Where does it stop at when you start these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Everybody in this country should have the same right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| And it's up to the voters to make that choice when they go in there and spin the little wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| Now, I can't say pull the lever down, but it's up to them to make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| We're not up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| We're not God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| We don't know what's right and best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| It's up to them to make that decision without taking someone's rights away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| Just very briefly, Tony, don't resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| Secondly, the city has a similar qualification for running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7565)|
| 2:06:12| The state has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| The federal government has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| There's a reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| Again, I had said I wasn't going to bring it up because I thought, and again, I know that I read the tea leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| but my colleagues want to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| I'm going to vote to let the citizens vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| I've been consistent in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| I voted to let them vote for the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| I wanted them to vote way back in January, and we couldn't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| and we were continually stonewalled on voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| I agree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| I have a lot of confidence in our citizens, and I think they'll do the right thing when it comes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| if this could be put before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| So I'm going to vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| But, again, well, I'm just going to vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| Mr. Hammond, I want to ask you, you've enlightened me to some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| Are you saying that a person who works for the government can't run for the president or for the senator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| or something like that if they work for the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| No, I'm saying that there are laws on the state level that prohibit state employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| You said on the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| There are things about the federal, and I would need to research the exact law I had in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| but I didn't bring it tonight because I didn't think we were going to get into this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| But there is a Hatch Act and so forth that says that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| there is a prohibition against certain federal employees running for United States Senate or Congress and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| Again, we can go on and on and on, but we all know how we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| Mr. Chairman, I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Yeah, we need to let Jim here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| If you'll give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| Yes, Jim McEvers, 12630 Early Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7655)|
| 2:07:43| As a citizen's response to this, I know you probably find that hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| And you're a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| And I'm a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| I was going to say as an open knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| I'm a candidate, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| First, I'd like to address the issue that, you know, the problems and the problem of perception that the citizens have of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7672)|
| 2:08:04| It wasn't created by, you know, county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| I mean, it was created, we all know, through some, let's say, less than open dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7687)|
| 2:08:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| You lost the trust of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| The citizens said that they want to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| And it would appear that you're trying, you know, Mr. Pinkston says that he wants people to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| Mr. Lambert says he wants people to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| But yet, you're sitting here trying to take it out of the people's hands so that it doesn't even show up to give the people a chance to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7714)|
| 2:08:44| As much as they're going to get to vote on is the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| If one of them happens to be a county employee or something, you're saying, well, they can shift over to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| If that's the only person running for that office, they're kind of in a fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| I think what the citizens of Knox County and the Knox County question one, they sat down here and told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7736)|
| 2:09:03| It's on the web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| It's published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| At all of their forums, people told them that they wanted the ability to vote on whether county employees could serve on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7746)|
| 2:09:18| They've asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| They've made it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| What I understand is it's going to be taken out of their hands by the commission before it even gets a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7762)|
| 2:09:30| Going back to term limits, term limits seem to be a hard thing to get through the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| It seemed to be a hard thing to finally get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| It was just unbelievably fought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| I don't know why that took so long to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7784)|
| 2:09:51| Commissioner Lambert says it's wrong to exclude people from running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7791)|
| 2:09:58| I don't have them all with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| I can look in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| There's already people excluded from running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| The military, and I can't name all the categories, but there are already some categories of people that cannot run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7806)|
| 2:10:18| As Mr. Owings, the law director, has pointed out, because we have a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7818)|
| 2:10:25| we have the freedom to decide if we want to make an amendment like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| We can determine our own destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| But some reason or other on this commission, we don't you want to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| You don't even want to let the citizens exercise their right of changing their form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| So I, as a citizen, I think I would be personally very disappointed if this doesn't get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| to where the voters can determine what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Okay, Jim, let me just ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| You said the people wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| I had many, many calls yesterday from people on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| You know, you talk about Knoxville 1 question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| Now, how was that formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Someone had to start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| Now, who was that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| Who got the first phone call to Joe Johnson to say, hey, we need to start this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| Where did it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| I don't know who the first person was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| Well, this is an attempt by some to get a metro government through a different way other than the ballot box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| And, you know, the people in Knox County that I've talked to tell us to, you know, stay strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7891)|
| 2:11:39| I met with one of them this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| He gave me nine amendments that they want to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7901)|
| 2:11:49| I'm up here asking that it be allowed to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| Well, I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| Okay, if there's somebody else in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| You're running for a position on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| At some point, I want to put a TABOR, a Taxpayer Bill of Rights, on the amendment for the people to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7923)|
| 2:12:12| What that would basically say is Knox County could not raise any taxes without it going to a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7932)|
| 2:12:21| A standard Taxpayer Bill of Rights that's been passed in other parts of the country where, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| instead of raising people's taxes, we have to get their buy-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| Would you support me in putting my TABOR on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| I'm going to remember you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| John, I just gave him the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Jim, what we're doing is we're going against state law if we pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| Now, our charter, this is for you, Mr. Law Director, did not the court rule that we had a de facto charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7970)|
| 2:12:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| When Judge Weaver sent it to the, when he ruled that it was no good and he sent it and the court upheld Judge Weaver's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7979)|
| 2:13:06| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| Well, what happened then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| We have a valid charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| It is de facto valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| I was the one that made the de facto valid argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| Without that argument being made, don't know if the Supreme Court picks up on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8001)|
| 2:13:27| Let's say that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Let's give them the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| Without finding that we have a valid charter, you have no term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| You have no term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| You have no charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| So you would have no term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| That's what the court found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Now, in Jordan, you have to go all the way back to Bailey where in the Bailey case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| the Supreme Court unanimously found that Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| which is the only other charter form of government in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| could term limit their legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| It can also term limit their mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| All that's provided for in the enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| What the Constitution provides, there was an amendment going back to 1972, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8053)|
| 2:14:20| The Constitution was amended to allow the legislature to create alternative forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| They did that through the enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| Through that legislation, we were able to create a charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| Through that enabling statute, we are able to determine the size of our governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8074)|
| 2:14:43| the qualifications for office, term limits, or a qualification of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8083)|
| 2:14:50| We definitely have term limits for our legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| Whether a person is an office holder, whether you can be an office holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| or a county employee and serve on this body, that is another qualification for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| That's why I believe what the Supreme Court said in Bailey and now what they've said in Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| gives the Knox County citizens the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| gives them the opportunity to determine who serves on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| If they wish to, if the citizens of this county wish to limit that to non-county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8124)|
| 2:15:31| I believe they can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| Can we go against the state law and the Constitution of the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8134)|
| 2:15:40| Our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| I just told you what the Constitution said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| The term limits there, there's nothing in the Constitution or anything that says it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| In the Constitution it says that the legislative body, that our state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| can create alternative forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| They did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| They did that in, oh, 1983 or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| Shelby County was the first county to create a charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| We followed suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| We created one in 1988 and went into effect in 1990 as a result of that state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8168)|
| 2:16:15| which comes much later than the legislation that you're referring to that provides that any law notwithstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8175)|
| 2:16:27| an employee of the county may serve on the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| I recognize that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| But much later was created the charter enabling statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| We have a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| We know through Bailey, we know through Jordan, two Supreme Court cases, two state Supreme Court cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8200)|
| 2:16:47| that say the citizens of this county can decide the structure of their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| What I'm trying to say is they give us the right to choose our form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| And that's our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| But also when they gave us that right, did they not say that we could not go against the Constitution and state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| And we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| It's my opinion that the citizens of this county would not be violating the state Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| because the state legislature has the authority to create alternative forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| They have done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| The citizens of this county have determined what that government is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| It is a charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| We have a valid charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| The technical deficiencies in our charter were corrected by the November election in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| There were technical deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| The Supreme Court said we had a de facto valid charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| It is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| That's why we have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| That's why you guys are sitting here today is because you have a valid charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| There is no state law saying that we can't have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| But there is a state law saying that county officials have the right to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| I mean, county employees have the right to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| There's also a state law that says the citizens of this county can determine the qualifications for office of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| And if they wish to determine that county employees cannot serve on this body, I believe they may do so in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| conformity with the Constitution and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| I don't have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| I can't flip it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| Let us get done and we'll give you an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| Commissioner Strickland is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Jim, I heard you say something about one question or whatever the name of that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| I believe in some of the things they say and some of the things I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| We're in agreement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| One that I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| I'm the longest serving commissioner on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| I've served with some great county employees that served on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| Craig Luthor being one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| And I just can't go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| I don't think that we people say that the people won't, the people won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| I think it's just a very few of the people, the loud minority over the silent majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| I had, like Commissioner Moore, I had a lot of calls this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| And I was surprised that people were thinking the other way because of this letter that came out in the Sunday paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8359)|
| 2:19:27| The people, the people say we won't turn limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| And then they vote eight out of the nine people back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| The people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| But they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| You figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| You know, we talk about the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| It's a very complex group of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| Loud minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| They voted them all back, eight out of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Well, but the point is they had that option with the term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8391)|
| 2:20:00| They had that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| They had the ability to make the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| We can say that they made the wrong choice or maybe they chose not to exercise the power that was given to them by that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8404)|
| 2:20:12| If they decided they wanted to vote the people back in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| And all I'm saying is that I think the citizens of Knox County are intelligent enough and they have the voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8415)|
| 2:20:25| That's the people that are out there that put people in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| To make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| To make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| And they may make the wrong decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| They may make the right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| You folks make the wrong decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| You make the right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| It's all in the eye of the beholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| But for the county commission to sit here and say that we are going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| We're going to stop the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| We're going to prevent them having the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| And that's all we're asking is give them the opportunity to decide if they want to let county employees serve on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8454)|
| 2:21:03| And if you're getting all these phone calls, then I don't think there's anything to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| I'm not sure why a couple of commissioners on this board are so afraid of giving the citizens this power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8469)|
| 2:21:17| You said something about the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| We are going to give the people a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| If you don't want a state or county employee, don't vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8481)|
| 2:21:28| If you want them, vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| They're getting a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| But I hear time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| All I'm saying is I go by, you know, the motivation for question one, I looked at the forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8496)|
| 2:21:41| Now, unless they put the responses, unless those are non-valid responses at all the forums that they held where they said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8501)|
| 2:21:49| people wanted, they wanted the ability to keep county employees from serving on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8509)|
| 2:21:56| If they just out and out lied in those surveys, then I'm in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| But I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| Hang on, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| I got the light, but I got the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| If they out and out lied in those forums and they put out wrong information, I think that's a very serious breach of public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8528)|
| 2:22:17| But what I read when I read through those forums is I saw that that's what they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| And all I'm up here asking for is don't stop it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| If they want the ability to have county employees serve on this commission, then they will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8547)|
| 2:22:38| When this amendment comes up to a vote, they'll vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| And they say if there's a majority of them that say we want to be able to have anybody serve on this, then they'll vote that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8562)|
| 2:22:52| But for this commission to take it out of their hands and say we don't even want to give you that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| And as you say, if, you know, they don't have to vote for a candidate if they see that he's an ox county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8578)|
| 2:23:07| Just take it one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| Give them a chance to vote on it once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| Like I said, they had to get term limits into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| And there's people that disagree with having term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| I had some fellow tell me the other day, he says, that's the craziest thing that ever came down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| And I said, well, everybody's entitled to their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Hey, Jim, your time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| Well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| More lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Well, what we probably need to do, we probably need to just get rid of all the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| When the issue comes up, just put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| We can have a vote every month and let the people go ahead and do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| But they voted for me to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| I've talked to people, most of the people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| And they could care less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| Well, there's another characteristic that I notice about things come up on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| Rather than be rational about it, some of these things get almost to the point of absurdity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| And I'll go as far as like preventing news, anybody associated with the news media serving on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8644)|
| 2:24:13| That one doesn't make a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| Because when you're a county employee and you make decisions, then you've got to go back to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8657)|
| 2:24:26| Wherever that office is, you're getting your salary from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| And I'm not saying that everybody's bad that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| But when you go back to the office, that's different than somebody in the news media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| or some other profession that would be excluded from serving on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| When they go back to their office, their paycheck doesn't depend on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| You know, you can speak your mind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| I'm not sure that Mike Hammond, when he goes back to his office, that his paycheck is impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| or there are any repercussions from something that he does on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| Because he is not tied directly to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| So thank you very much for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I appreciate your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Jim, I gave you 15 minutes of TV time for your campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| But sincerely, as I said, when I first stepped up here before I announced my candidacy, it was a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| And I think you guys listened to me more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| Now that I'm a candidate, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| Your opponent said he wanted equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Yeah, I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| If they would come on down here, I mean, one of the nice things about being at these commission meetings is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| I was kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| I have a feeling we'll hear an awful lot from Dr. Briggs when he's sitting across from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| Let's get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| Let's hear from the folks lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| If you'll give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| My name is Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| I reside at 2631 Bakertown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| Lived in Knox County along with my wife and my two children for a little over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| Been to these committee meetings about three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| Tonight takes the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Tonight truly takes the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| With all that the commission has went through in the last year and a half, as the gentleman said a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8781)|
| 2:26:30| there's a number of things that the citizens want the opportunity to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8790)|
| 2:26:37| One of them was term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| How many years ago was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| Nine years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| And it just now made their break, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| It just now happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| Nine years after it was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| So here we sit today talking about what is of interest to the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| and what may not be of interest to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| There are members on this commission that have indicated they are for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| Those that are against, I think the least you could do as part of your public service is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| allow the citizens to vote on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| That will bring to a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| There will be no more talks about what should or shouldn't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| but it will bring to a head whether or not employees of the county can become county commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8845)|
| 2:27:36| The history, the last year and a half, two years has shown us that the public's trust is about two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8856)|
| 2:27:43| on a level of ten is about two, maybe one and a half or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| This commission has the opportunity to make several steps to allow the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8868)|
| 2:27:57| and the trust in this body to be elevated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| Voting against this amendment or this resolution will not increase the public's opinion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8881)|
| 2:28:13| And I assure you, on a personal note, for the last 12, 15 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8893)|
| 2:28:21| I have copied every article out of the newspaper, everybody that's on the county commission that's rerunning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| everyone that's John Q Public that works for the city, works for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| I have the news clipping, so I know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8915)|
| 2:28:39| And when I go to vote, I know who they are, just like I did here a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8919)|
| 2:28:45| So what I recommend to this committee, this commission, is that you raise up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| and you allow the citizens to decide whether they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| or don't want members of the government to be on the employee status of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8937)|
| 2:29:04| I think that's what they want, and I think that's what they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| I'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| Cindy Buttrey, 6404 Ridge Walk Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| I've tried to not comment on this as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| but I felt in light of this obligated to because as a former county employee myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8968)|
| 2:29:38| I really feel like sometimes that they get a bad rap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| And it's really not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8984)|
| 2:29:50| I worked in the property assessor's office for 12.5 years before I became a school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8990)|
| 2:29:56| and was also elected to that position while I was a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=8996)|
| 2:30:01| And I can honestly say that I was in that line of work before I ever became a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9001)|
| 2:30:11| But I think the two go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| I think that a lot of times people that work for county government are in that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| and in that job, and I consider it, in my case, a profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9020)|
| 2:30:25| because they truly care about helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| It's about being a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| It's about trying to do all you can for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9032)|
| 2:30:37| It's about finding ways to make government better and closer to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9037)|
| 2:30:44| And if you weren't in that position to begin with, then you probably don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9044)|
| 2:30:52| So when you are in government to begin with and then you run for office, the two just go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9052)|
| 2:31:02| You know, to me, there's no conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| There are conflicts of interest that can arise, however, when you make votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| And I completely understand what you all are going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9071)|
| 2:31:16| And this is not up here to ask you or to tell you how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| This is just me basically taking up for county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| because I really feel like a lot of times they just don't get the credit that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9085)|
| 2:31:34| And they certainly don't get the pay that they deserve, but that's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| But they really don't get the credit that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| And I completely understand why Mr. Norman, Commissioner Norman, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9103)|
| 2:31:51| stepped down and didn't want that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| I totally respect him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| I did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| I no longer work for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| However, if I did, I wouldn't see what was wrong with that, because the people elected me the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| and they have the opportunity to elect me again in another four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| And if they chose to make that one issue the reason why they didn't want me to run, then that's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9135)|
| 2:32:25| I can respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9145)|
