| 0:00:35| These are difficult times, and they really try our faith and try our wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=35)|
| 0:00:43| And we pray that you will be with us in every way, that we may be good stewards of your land which you've given us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=43)|
| 0:00:52| the opportunities you've given us, and of those funds on which we deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=52)|

| 0:01:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our October 7th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Any questions dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Seeing none, any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Yes, I'd like to ask for a postponement of two weeks on 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| This is the sidewalk resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| I know it's being worked on by transportation and mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| I also know that the engineering department has some good ideas in moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| and Fountain City Connections has been involved in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| There's a chance that the engineering department will have something in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| and there's a chance that they might need this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Both are a little unlikely, but it's probably better to have it there than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| So I'd like to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| The motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=158)|

| 0:02:40| Anything else to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Consent items are 11L through S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| Is there a motion to approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Questions on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Councilman, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| There's a gentleman sitting out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| I think he came to speak for the red light cameras, and there's --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| I don't think there's anything on our agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Yeah, somebody came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| That was mentioned to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| The item on the agenda dealing with the traffic is for a traffic, new traffic signal on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| Could I call on the chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| He and I discussed this before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Can I call on him to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Excuse the interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=200)|

| 0:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Actually, it was set for the agenda for tonight because we thought the contract was going to be returned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| However, it is still with the attorneys for the vendor that was selected, and it has not been returned yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| So we expect to have it before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| But we -- while it was scheduled for tonight, it is not going to be heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| I apologize for the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| I said the 11E is about a new traffic signal on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| I do have one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=230)|

| 0:03:53| When does Reflex contract expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Don't hold me to the specific date, but it's around the first week in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| I think it's November 8th, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| November 8th or 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=244)|

| 0:04:32| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=272)|

| 0:04:45| I think you all know about the $200,000 grant that we received with assistance from DOE and TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| The kickoff is at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=293)|

| 0:05:01| So, I hope you all will get a chance to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| That's actually a really big deal for us as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Secondly, I want to remind everybody that before we meet again, Halloween will come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And on October 31st, the Knoxville Police Department hosts a Halloween in the city at Safety City from 5 to 8 for all of our listeners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=310)|

| 0:05:43| And hopefully, it will always be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Finally, just we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| I think a lot of you all were at the Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| And we announced the beginning of working on the new Urban Wilderness and Historic Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| It's a 1,000-acre corridor across the river encompassing three Civil War forts and other distinctive features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| It will be linked to the South Waterfront Project by Greenway and Trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| It's obviously the early stages, and we have a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| But we're excited about the beginnings of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Last thing on Mayor's Report, I want to recognize the Knoxville Alumni Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| That would be the women in red out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=377)|

| 0:07:18| We have Delta Days at the state capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| And so we thought it fitting that we come to Delta Days at the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=441)|

| 0:07:45| And I want to welcome Ms. Gater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| I think this is your very first city council meeting ever, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| We're glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Ms. Gater and my sisters, you know, they know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| The women of Delta Sigma Theta know what I mean when I say sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| My fraternity and their sorority, we're brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| And good to see you all out and appreciate all the good hard work that you guys do in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| There's a lot of excellent leadership out of Delta Sigma Theta that's had a positive impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| and has had a positive impact on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| And continues to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| And I commend you for that and your involvement here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| And trust me, when she says there are 112 members, I think there's probably 300 or 400 in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| And they can come together when they need to to impact our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| And thank you so much for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| We're moving to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Mayor, I believe you covered most of what I was going to announce or remind council of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| just in case they weren't aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| I did put a brochure in front of every council member about the urban wilderness and historic corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| And I think you, again, I think you covered most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Councilman Roddy serves on the Legacy Parks Foundation Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| She may want to say something about it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| But it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you, Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| And thank you, Mayor, for your support and for being there on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| The Legacy Parks Foundation Board was extremely pleased and excited to announce this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| We feel like it's a huge signature push for our city and dovetails well with our south waterfront plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| And because it ties together protection of view sheds and ridges as well as historic Civil War forts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| we think it's a very exciting initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| And I think, again, it's very important to recognize the early contribution of the Aslan Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| It had not been for their incredible generosity and their expenditure of $2.3 million to acquire the log haven property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=580)|
| 0:09:50| This, I don't think this would have been nearly so easy or maybe wouldn't have happened as quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| I think they made a tremendous difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| And I think they deserve recognition at every opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| And so I want to acknowledge them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| The other thing that I have, and I think all council members have a copy of this brochure that says Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| Tennessee on the front, and thanks to the hard work of many people, the city's community development department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| and Elizabeth Easton Architecture and the other firms that are involved with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| we're off to a great start in terms of the urban design work for Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| So we had a meeting yesterday evening, and there's another one coming up at 6 p.m. on November 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=629)|
| 0:10:38| also at the Vestal United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| But I just want to encourage all the council members, if you can, to come to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| and to keep track of this great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Thanks, Joe, and thanks for bringing both those brochures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| And I appreciate this handout about Knoxville Urban Wilderness and Historic Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| I was not able to make the luncheon, but I did have a general comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| I'm glad to hear it's in the early stages because I noticed here, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| I noticed there's no mentioning here of the Hasty Park, the Hasty Park, which is in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| And I think that with that new park coming on 9th Lane for Judge Hasty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| well-known jurist, African-American jurist from Tennessee, from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| who was the first judge ever elected to the federal bench in the United States of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| We have a park out in South Knoxville named for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| And I would hope that somehow it gets involved in this historic corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| And I'm sure that since it's in the beginning stages that we'll be able to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| And this is the first time I've seen it, so the first time I've had an opportunity to comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| But I would love to see the Hasty Park as a part of this effort here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And hopefully, maybe Council Member Roddy can bring it to the Foundation Parks Notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| And also, I'm sure that the councilman from the First Ditch will be glad to carry forward that information and that request from me also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| But it's a great park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| It's a young park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| There's still a lot of things to be done to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| I know Councilman Holquist has been out, and they've been having volunteers clean it up and do some things to begin to define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| But I would hope that it gets included here in this historic movement here on the front end so we don't try to include it on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| Councilman Brown, I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| And you'll notice that there are only a few of the facilities or parks or potential acquisitions mentioned by the wording in this brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=745)|
| 0:12:36| But if you look at the map, the center of the map, lower just to the left of the word 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| And I'm sorry for all you folks out in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| You can't see what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Unfortunately, just councilmembers have this brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| But there's a park indicated that the shape is very roughly like South America in shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=768)|
| 0:12:57| That is Hasty Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| So it is in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| It is a part of this important corridor, and I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| And also, I will mention that the Neighborhood Association, the Lake Forest Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| applied for a city recreation matching grant and did get that for improvements in Hasty Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| And they're also working with the Mountain Bike Association to improve the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| So good things are happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| And I think in the very near future, there will be a potential resource to help with that park in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| I know there is a chapter of attorneys that are trying to band together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| They may name themselves, actually going to be proposed to be named in honor of Justice Hasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| And that would bring some legal resources possibly to the table that could help in trying to continue to grow that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| and provide the resources and also research necessary to continue to ensure the future of that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| So as that comes along and comes online, councilman, I'll be glad to talk with you about that possible resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| human resource of attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| I hear trial lawyers have a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Yeah, Rob does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Before we get into all your jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Moving on to any other reports, councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Chairman Bill Cole of the Police Advisory Review Committee is here to present their annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| And, Bill, if you'd come up and speak with us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Mayor Haslam, councilmembers, I'm Bill Cole, the chairman of the Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| And to begin, I'd like to introduce Avis Reed, who I'm sure you know, the executive director of PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| and also Judge Robert Marion, one of our members that is joining me here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| And we're pleased to present this, our annual report for the past year, for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| Last year, as you know, PARC had a year of change for PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| As Carol Scott, who was the executive director since its inception, retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Carol was very active not only locally with PARC and police oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| but also with law enforcement oversight nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| But we, with her retirement, we were very fortunate to have Avis Reed come along and take over that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=915)|
| 0:15:24| And Avis, it was a seamless transition in great part due to the support of Commissioner Tank Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=924)|
| 0:15:35| who I think is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I don't see him, but he was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| And Commissioner Strickland, he fielded some phone calls in the interim period between Carol and Avis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| I know he was pleased when Avis got the job and he quit getting the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| But I'd also like to mention Lisa Chambers, who is the executive assistant to Avis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| who is not here tonight due to her mother's hospitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| But Lisa provides great support to and does much of the administrative work as Avis does much of the legwork for PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| But just very briefly, we've continued the efforts to improve the relationship between the citizens of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=969)|
| 0:16:19| and the Knoxville Police Department during this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| We've continued to assist citizens in resolving their complaints, working with internal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=983)|
| 0:16:32| with various officers of the KPD, and with the command staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| And we've enjoyed and continue to enjoy a very positive working relationship with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| That is evidenced by the fact that PARC has assisted in reviewing and recommending training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1005)|
| 0:16:55| Carol Scott and Avis Reed, since Carol left, have continued to provide cultural diversity training for the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1015)|
| 0:17:05| And, of course, Avis meets regularly with the chief and the deputy chiefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| and other command staff, as well as internal affairs, to ensure a continued good working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| We've also continued to review and refine our review process with the Knoxville Police Department internal affairs unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1037)|
| 0:17:26| and also our own procedures to ensure our procedures are in accordance with the Tennessee Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1046)|
| 0:17:38| And we appreciate the opportunity to serve in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| We have a lot of participation from the community, from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Our meetings have gone very well when issues come up with someone from either Chief Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| or one of his officers there to resolve questions that come up spontaneously at meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| It's been a very enjoyable year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| We would welcome any input from the council members, from the mayor, from, again, always from KPD and from the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1088)|
| 0:18:18| either now or in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| And we appreciate the opportunity to present this annual report, which is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Any questions for Mr. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| We do want to thank all of the members of PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| They do take this job very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And as you can see from the people that Bill recognized, this is a great committee of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1119)|

| 0:20:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Ms. Roddy, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Is Ms. Hummel here, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1223)|
| 0:20:35| Michelle, could you give us just your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Michelle Hummel, my address, 402 South Gay Street, number 307, Knoxville 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| It looks like you're drawing on your fund balance to balance your budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Is there a reason why you expect lower revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Actually, we take a very conservative, as you're aware, the city taxes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| property taxes are certified in October, and our budget is approved in June by our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| and, of course, created around March or April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| So we take a very conservative look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| and we've had some monies in the past that we haven't used up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| and we feel it's really important we put our monies towards the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| and different areas to help generate that and best leverage our monies now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| Have you ever operated under a deficit budget in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Do you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1291)|

| 0:21:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1295)|

| 0:21:45| and the YMCA known as agreement number C-030008 to more clearly define both the property being leased by the YMCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1305)|

| 0:22:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| We're still doing the lease purchase for the property over on Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| We're still doing the lease purchase agreement, is that right, for the East Side Y on Wilson and South Castle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| I just noticed in one of the paragraphs it just says lease, but I think it was supposed to be a lease purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Am I correct there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| My understanding was that we've already made all the contributions for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Are you talking about the old Y building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Yeah, she's talking about the old Y that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| She's talking about the E.V. Davidson Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Was that supposed to be a lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Isn't that a lease purchase agreement with him or is that just a straight lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| I can check that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Yeah, let us check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Any other questions in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1382)|

| 0:23:39| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| I want to ask Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Dave, if you could come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| If he could just run us through the process so we understand it a little bit about what all this entailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| and how long it's taken and just quite a bit of money here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| Dave, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Dave Watson, 1300 North Broadway, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| I'm not going to belabor going through the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| but about four years ago this council created the Residential Neighborhood Traffic Safety Committee led by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| Councilman Bailey, supported by Councilman Becker, Pilo and Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| created a process that has been adopted and been modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| As we went through the process, we found out there were some not such user-friendly parts of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| of working with city engineering and the Traffic Safety Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| The process was simplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| A reduction of fees at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| It could cost the neighborhood several thousand dollars to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| But that's been reduced to a flat fee of $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| All this started back in about 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| But as of last year, we've had five neighborhoods go through the new and improved process, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| where they threw a petition, request assistance with their traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| We hold neighborhood meetings, create a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| City engineering reviews the plan, and both engineering and the neighborhood approve, in theory, the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| Each design center mails a copy of each plan with a cover letter and the pros and cons, advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| and disadvantages of each device, type of device, to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| And the neighborhoods are allowed to send back a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| They must return 50 percent of the surveys that are mailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Of the returns, it takes a two-thirds majority to approve a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| And each one of these neighborhoods have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| So they've all exceeded the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| They've all returned more than 50 percent, and they've all had more than two-thirds approval of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| And I just want to say there, as you look at this, there are a number of different types of physical devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| and we're going to monitor those and see what works, what's effective, and what isn't, and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| I think some of these actually started back before we got in this process four, five, six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Is that right, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I think some have been in it eight or nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| Yes, it's been a long haul for some, but that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| I just wanted to thank, well, you know, the continuing efforts of the Traffic Calming Committee that got this set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| and the East Tennessee Community Design Center, because I certainly know there are other neighborhoods out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| that are going through this process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| And let me just say one more thing about Dave Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| I do appreciate all his work, and I'm sure all of us that have watched this unfold that it's not easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| and it's a lot of people on both sides of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| and it's a tough deal to work with these neighborhoods, and I just think they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Councilwoman Pilar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Well, David, I really want to commend you and the engineering department for the hard work you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| and the many hours that you have spent, because I know a number of these neighborhoods are in the area I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| and this has been a long-term process and wish list from some of these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| But I really, for those who are listening, want to commend the neighborhoods for their patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| and their willingness to wait until the Traffic Calming Committee could work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| and make recommendations and come up with a process that would be fair to all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| because the big problem, I think, always was and will be that everyone wants something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| but everyone's not willing to go through the tough work and the homework that it takes for a neighborhood to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| So this takes a lot of folks working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| And I know that our funds are beginning to get very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| and so we may have to look for other avenues for providing the kind of assistance to neighborhoods in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| But thank you so much for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| And you may want to comment on that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Since you're voting on capital expenditure, I will tell you the new process is education, enforcement, and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1693)|
| 0:28:22| And presently, we're not offering, there's no offering for engineering solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| They're all education and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| I appreciate you commenting on that because I know that to be the fact, and I understand the reasoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1710)|
| 0:28:39| Except now, let me see, I think there might be one other aspect of that that you didn't mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| that I thought was out there, and that would be the rumble strips when you're entering a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| The rumble strips are considered part of the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| They drive across a rumble strip to get their attention, look up, and see a 25-mile-an-hour speed limit sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Following up on Councilman Pilo's comments and Mr. Watson's responses, these are some great devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1744)|
| 0:29:12| As you can see, they're fairly expensive, raise the intersection speed, humps, planted medians, concrete medians, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| They're great devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1760)|
| 0:29:20| I've seen them used in other cities and they're quite popular, but they do have a cost associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| I'm concerned if we --it seems that we've sort of cut those off altogether so that only the early neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| the ones that were early in the hopper, so to speak, were eligible for these kinds of engineering solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| And I'd like to find a way that we might investigate perhaps partnerships with neighborhoods on cost sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| some way that we can avoid continuing where we seem to be now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| which is to take engineering solutions off the table altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| I understand that that is sort of the current approach with the administration, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| but I think it would be great if we could find a way to, through partnerships or by whatever means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| continue to make this an option because there are, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| there are no substitutes for engineering solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| This may be either for Dave or Brent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I heard somebody mention rumble strips and had me think about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| What kind of feedback are we getting about the rumble strips that are out there with regards to their durability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| and their effectiveness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Because I've noticed in a couple of places after a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| it seems like they're beginning to kind of come up or come loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| If what I envision is a rumble strip, it's exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Are we getting any feedback from neighborhoods or anyone with regards to how effective those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| and whether we need to be replacing those or how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| What's the life span of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Because I've noticed in some places they're actually kind of beginning to come up and get peeled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| I have no information on the life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| The only feedback I've had has been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| I have seen a couple of installations that are on steep grade in hot weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| They tend to slip, and I think those are going to have to be dealt with differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Do you have anything to add to that, Brent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| No, other than I hadn't received any complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I would say this, that the cost is, I hate to even think of a percentage less than some of these other devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| It's not that expensive, you know, somewhere in the $300 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I'm thinking it's more like, you know, for a set of rumble strips, like $200 or less, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| So in comparison to these big devices, it's not a lot of money to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| Councilwoman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Well, I'll comment on both Councilman Hoch's statement and also on Councilman Brown's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| As for, you know, the effectiveness and how well they're received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| I think there was a little spot in West Hills where it was recommended that we attempt that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| and I think the community association was very happy to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| And that's been well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And so far, they're still down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| Councilman Brown, I don't know how long that'll last, but they're still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And then to comment on your statement, in which I, you know, I share your concerns for neighborhoods in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| However, let me say that, interestingly, I was in a neighborhood recently where they have had enormous complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| over my six years of trying to work with them about traffic control and calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| And they actually determined that it was so important to them that they wanted to bear the cost themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1973)|
| 0:33:02| And so they did have the humps and bumps, as Councilman Bailey wants to refer to them, put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| And they've been very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| And so I'm sure that the design center would work with the neighborhood to, on a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| and arrangement for those devices if a neighborhood wants to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| You know, the neighborhood I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Councilman Hulk, currently there's no the procedure for engineering solutions is after it's proven that education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| and enforcement don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| It's not the first alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| It's after the other two do not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And I think that's the proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I just hope that we don't find ourselves in a position where we never are able to offer any engineering solutions at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| And I think if we partner, if the city partners with community groups and shares cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| I think we can get accomplished a lot when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| We've proven that nothing else will work in particular instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| You know, thinking more about this and hearing the discussion, I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| But to the best of my recollection, the only neighborhoods that have received these engineering enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| or whatever they're called, the speed humps and speed bumps, are only in the fourth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| and the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| And, you know, I think we need to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| You know, as part of the city, you serve the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| And that all neighborhoods should receive equal treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| I certainly, you know, understand what Councilman Holquist was saying about shared costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| And not every neighborhood out there has the ability to share those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| But there are still, you know, those folks are as equally as important as every other person in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| So, you know, before we start maybe cutting off other neighborhoods that might be equally deserving in different parts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| I think we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Well, Councilman Frost, I agree with you completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| And it certainly didn't escape my notice or my attention that there was nothing in the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| or the sixth district or the fifth district, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| So I think that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| We do our paving contract that way, the repaving contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| And we split it up evenly by council districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| And there was a decision made to do that, handle it that way several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| And I think that's something we should look at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Well, this is not to disagree with anything Councilman Frost said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| But it's, for once, I remember something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| I remember the very first approved speed hump and bump situation was actually in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2151)|
| 0:36:01| In Councilman Becker's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| And it involved a very steep hillside where there was great concern about emerging traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| And actually while the traffic calming committee was trying to develop this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| and work on it with you, David, that was actually put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2175)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2196)|

| 0:37:58| It just took a moment for me to pull the information from my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| But this goes back to the original agreement in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| There was one agreement that provided both for the lease of the property from the Y, which was under a lease purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| and the lease to the Y, which was just a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| And we have made all of our lease purchase payments, and we're ready to prepare the deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| and that's when the property description discrepancies came to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| And that's why we're having to amend the original agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| But we're only having to amend Article 1, which has the property description, which only talks about the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| and the latter provisions in that document cover the lease purchase for the Wilson Avenue property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I just noticed in that one earlier paragraph it just said lease, and I said I hope that wouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081021?start=2320)|
