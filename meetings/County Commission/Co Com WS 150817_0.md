| 0:00:28| We'll take a moment to present, to have a brief presentation with us, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| kind of move forward from there with questions, with nobody has any objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| Foster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| I appreciate the opportunity to be here, and I think I'd be remiss if I didn't tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| you all if you didn't know today is Sandra's birthday, and it's Jolie's birthday today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| So I started Sandra's day today by singing happy birthday to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| I think she's been ill ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Again, I appreciate the opportunity to be here to tell you about some exciting things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| that are happening in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Before I do, I need to introduce a couple of people, because you all may ask some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| that I'm going to ask them to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| One of them is Pat Sullivan, who is my chief deputy, and to her right is Peggy Kane, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| They've been with me since day one, and we're lucky to have Travis Adderhold here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| Travis is a 17-year veteran of the Jefferson County Clerk's Office, and he came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| So we're really excited to have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| Also from Business Information Systems, the company that does our software, Stoney Hale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| and Josh Marklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Where'd you guys go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Oh, there they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| So I'm going to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| This is a very, very brief presentation, because I think there may be some misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| as to exactly what we do and how we do it, and I want to make sure you guys know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| So here's the first slide, and it's basically how the taxes flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| If you didn't know, we have 111 motels and hotels and campgrounds that pay hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| I didn't know if any of you all knew that the campgrounds pay business tax, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| do, and I went out and met with a bunch of them a couple of years ago, and they're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| But they send their money into the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| We get that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| We keep 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| We send 98% to Knox County, and then Knox County sends 40% of that money to visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| and I think the rest of the money is used for debt service and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| My friend Chris Caldwell could tell you more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| The next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Here's how the taxes have flowed over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| Of those 111 motels, hotels, and campgrounds, we've received $18,332,911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| We kept our 2%, which is a little over $366,000, and we turned over almost $8 million to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=169)|
| 0:02:57| County, $17,965,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| So we turned that over to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| The next slide, please, ma'am, will show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| It's exactly the same thing, but it's a great statistic that 94% of the taxes have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| I'd put that up against any governmental office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| I'd put it up against most businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| I think most businesses would love to have a 94% return on monies that are owed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| So I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Let's go to the next slide, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| And this is a year-over-year comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| In 2013, we collected $5.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| We kept $112,000, gave Knox County $5.25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| In 2014, we collected $5.9, which is almost $6 million, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| We kept $118,000 and turned over $5.798 million to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| And this next one is really awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| This last fiscal year, we collected $6.779 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| We kept $135,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| The county got $6.62 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| That is the largest collection in the history of Knox County for hotel-motel taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| So we've got to be doing something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| And I think we have to give a lot of credit to those hotels, motels, and campgrounds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| are doing the right thing, paying their taxes, which are passed-through taxes, giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| to us so that we can do what we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| So the next slide will show you that businesses submit their payments on the 20th of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| And if they miss or continue to miss, we do have an option of padlocking their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| But we've never done that, because I'm trying to avoid putting people out of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| And in 2009, I'd been in office about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| We served a distress warrant, which is basically this state law on a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I can't tell you who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| I can't tell you where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| But we literally walked up to the door with chains in our hands and padlocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| And the owner came out and said, if I give you a certified cashier's check in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| will you leave us alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I said, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| And he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| And we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| And he regularly pays his taxes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| So let me tell you where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Last week, Travis got together information on two different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| And he sent them via the U.S. Postal Service to these two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| They are tracked by the post office in the effect that if we send it registered, as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| know, somebody could refuse to sign for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| So it comes right back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| So we send it just with the tracking so we'll know when they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| And when they get it, the clock starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| They have 30 days to give me a call so we can chat and we can talk about how much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| they owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Six more are going out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| So we've got basically eight properties out of 111 that aren't playing nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| And we're going to go after them to get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| And I've met with Bud Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| I've met with Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| You know, I think that overall we're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| You know, it's hard to compare $18 million to $475,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| But the $475,000 is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| We're going to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| But, you know, if I've been remiss and reticent about collecting these taxes, you can blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| it on me because I know a lot of people that work in the hotel industry and I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| to put that single mother who has two kids at home from waitressing at a hotel because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| her owner didn't pay their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| But we're going after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| We're going to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| And I'm concerned about the economic impact it may have on the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| But I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| And the other thing is that people have spoken so much about open records and what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| release and what we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| And last week, I spent many, many hours with probably the best constitutional public records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| attorney in the country in Rick Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| And Rick pointed out the law covering business taxes and hotel-motel taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| In the past, it was a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| The legislature has changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| And let me just read two little quick sentences to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| Rick wrote, pursuant to TCA 67-1-1702, tax returns, tax information, and tax administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| information shall be confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| The violation of that section is punishable as a Class E felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| Pursuant to TCA 67-1-1709, based on these authorities, I believe it would be prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| for a responsible public official charged with the responsibility of being a custodian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| of tax information to decline to publicly release that information absent a court order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| an opinion from the Knox County Law Director, or the State Attorney General stating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| release of the information was permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| And he gave me an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| He said, let's say this is a tax return from Motel or Hotel X, and it's laying on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| And somebody comes in to bring you a cup of coffee and say, hi, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| They look down and they see Motel X owes X amount of money, I've just committed a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| I can go to prison, I can lose my job, I can lose my retirement, I can lose my pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| and I lose all of my rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| I won't be able to vote anymore, I'll be a convicted felon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| That ain't happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| And the media has been really good to work with us, they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| And I have sent a letter to Senator McNally, as you know, Mayor Burchett did, I want these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| records open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| I think that the media, I think that you all, I think all of us as residents of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| have a right to know who's not paying their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| And that's not only Hotel and Motel, but that's also business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| But right now it's against the law, and I'm not going to jail for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| So Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Before we get started, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| CTAS is in the building, you guys, they've come, they've offered to come, so if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| got questions of CTAS, they're here, and I appreciate them being here, and if you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| anything that we need to be talking about, let us know, give us a wave, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Foster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Is the figures you had up here the combination of the two taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| That's just, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| You mean Hotel Business and Business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Hotel and Motel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| That's just Hotel and Motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Business tax is totally separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| As you know, the state took that over in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| The business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| We fought that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| The business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| And so it all goes to the State Department of Revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| They figure out what their...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| How much they can keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| And how much they send back to us, and they send us a check back now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| Mrs. Kane has that information if you'd like to have it, but I don't have it here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| I just thought we were going to talk about Hotel and Motel, but Commissioner Brown, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| be glad to get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Well, just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Do you know how they handle it if those aren't paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Who's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| The state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| How does the state handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I think they basically do it the same way, Commissioner, excuse me, that we do, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| they fall under the same law, wouldn't they, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| Yeah, they have a similar...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Matter of fact, the original law was for the state, and we just refer back as a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| act refers us back, gives you the same powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| I think we both have the same power to do it, and, you know, I think, and we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| about this a million times with the folks in Nashville, and they have the power to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| go in and seize people's working records, their bank accounts, and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| I don't know that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| What I'm hoping is is that these folks that have been reticent to submit their taxes will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| see what we're doing, and they will start writing checks quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Foster, moving forward, we, I'll get you in just a second there, moving forward as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| talk about avoiding this reoccurrence of some folks being delinquent, what kind of powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| or what kind of procedure do we have to go into a business and subpoena their records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| if they don't pay, or audit them to see if they're paying the correct amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| What's the procedure for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| We do, Mr. Chairman, and I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| I was in the audit, and I'm tickled to death with the audit, you know, if I'm doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| I shouldn't be doing, if I can be doing something better, let me know, and they suggested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| we have an auditor on board, and rather than hire an auditor, costing the county a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| of money for, you know, the whole package, we are contracting with a local audit firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| to come in, and we're going to be auditing four hotels a quarter, and we're just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| to pick them out, Travis is going to pick them out, and we're going to go audit them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| we can do that, and we can actually, you know, we get this letter, they have 30 days, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| Chairman, and then we can send them another letter telling them that they haven't paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| they haven't responded, at that point I go, I give them 10 days, I think, and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| go padlock their doors, and then we send them another letter, and in 10 more days we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| sell their furniture and all their fixtures and everything in the building, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| it's 30 days after that we can sell the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| I'm hoping and praying it never gets to that, but those are our remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So in terms of the 8 out of the 11 that you've gone after, this is the first year you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| done that, so how do these other years, I guess my question is, have we done that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| the past, or is this a new process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| No, sir, it's not a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| We have sent out letters where, you know, tell the hotels that they need to pay us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| and we frankly didn't go after them because another misconception is we're missing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| We're not missing the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| The money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| It's compounded 8% annually, even though they haven't turned it in, and the other problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Commissioner, is that, and Travis can expound on this much better than I, but if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| a hotel that won't submit, the only way we can figure out their taxes is if they submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| on a monthly basis how many rooms they let out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Well, if they don't submit that information, Travis can't come up with any type of an assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| so that's been a problem as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Okay, but in terms of these others, since you say that we've sent them the letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| and you're right, it's kind of like stocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| It's nothing until you cash it in, so we're, this money, these monies are compounding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| so what's the, for the last five years, what does that number look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| I can get it for you, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| That would be good if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Sure, I'll be glad to get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| You can send that to all of us that are in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| And this may be a question for CTAS, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| In terms of 94% collection rate, for a county our size, is that a number that's average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| above average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Is that a, you know, it seems like that would be the state county, I mean, county clerks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| would have some basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Wesley Robertson with CTAS, I don't think that statistic's known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| Ninety-four percent on property tax, you know, a county builds in a delinquency rate on property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| tax, that's probably a pretty good delinquency rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| I don't know what the Knox County's is, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Yeah, I think we're a little higher than 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| I'd say 90% to 96, 7% on property tax is probably an average delinquency rate, and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| be a similar type of issue, but that's not known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Yeah, ours is 98% in Knox County, yeah, around there, so I mean, okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| And then my last question, I guess for now, I have two other questions, one may be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| CTAS, I'll ask that while you're closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| In terms of an auditor, Foster brought up that he has engaged in subcontract to an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| firm, is that something that is common, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| I'd say that's probably, that would be a good practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Last week I reached out to Sevier County, and obviously Sevier County's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| in the hotel, motel business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| They contract with a company that goes out and does the audit every year, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| have the name of that company, but we could get the name of that company, that Hamilton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| County, they do it in-house, their internal audit staff does it in-house, Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| does it in-house, I don't know what department at Davidson County does it, but they do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| in-house also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| So have we not been doing that at all, is my question, prior to this arrangement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| we're going to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| During audits, no sir, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Quite frankly, Commissioner, I don't have the staff to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| When I came, there were seven people in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Most of them were working from home, two of them were given Fridays off to go fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| I cut that office drastically, I've got three people in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| I don't have the manpower to do those audits, and we don't have the expertise, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| I think we need to reach out to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| That's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| I mean, if you don't, this is the way to go, it just seemed like we would have made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| decision a little earlier than this far into this, your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| My last question is the Rick Hollows, well, the county law, when was that passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| This is not a county law, Commissioner, this is state law, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| When was the state law passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| It was modified, I think, and Bud, I think it was modified like two years ago, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| I can find out, but they did put more teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I don't know why, I'm assuming that there was information getting out that shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| get out, and my concern is, but I think the law would protect me, and maybe Bud can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| this, once I send it out, you know, and I send it to a hotel, if they release it, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| on them, not on me, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| So I guess my question for that one, just a question is, prior to that law being enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| why didn't we make those numbers public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| This question is probably more for Mr. Wright or Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| At the Audit Committee, I thought I heard that there was 120 properties that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| by the Audit Committee, not including campgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Here we're seeing that we have 111 total properties, does anybody remember the number from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| But I thought it was about 120, does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I wish I'd have brought that stuff with me, but it was in that ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| Okay, but they didn't identify campgrounds either at that time, these were just 120 hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| or motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| May I comment on that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| I've got the executive summary of the hotel-motel occupancy tax, and it says, background, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| are 110 lodging businesses, hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts, campgrounds, and recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| vehicle parks in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| That's the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| So, I don't know where that figure came from, Commissioner, but yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| And then this question is for Mr. Robertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| Are you aware of any other municipalities in the state of Tennessee that publicize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| delinquent hotel-motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| It's funny you ask that, because we were just talking about that before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| I did a little research before the meeting, and I was trying to dig into maybe what Shelby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| County does and if they've had similar issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| I found an article in the Commercial Appeal where Memphis City published the names of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| some hotels that were delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Now, clearly that would violate the state law, but I found it interesting that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| was in the Commercial Appeal, it was from like a May article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| Of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| As far as you know, is there any difficulty in publishing the people's names who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| paid the hotel-motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| I'm not an attorney, and that's a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I'd really defer you to your legal office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| I mean, we could look into that, get our attorneys to opine on it, but I would say the same statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| probably applies, but again, I'm sharing my ignorances with you on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| The law director is shaking his head no, so I guess that's not an option for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| The law addresses the investigation, the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Anything related to this tax is kind of like your sales tax can't be disclosed either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Anything related to this can actually lead to information regarding the business itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| and I think that's why the legislature put together this protection so that other competitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| don't have an undue advantage of what the businesses are doing and how well they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| doing or not how well they're doing, but I think the one that's currently being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| from Senator McNally is if you're in a rearage of your taxes, that puts you in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| status and your protection should be removed, but right now, anything related to this tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| is part of the, kind of like your personal income tax, is part of the tax-gathering process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| It's part of any form of audit, it's part of any information gathering, it's protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| by this statute, and the only exemption whereby something can be made public is if Mr. Arnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1219)|
| 0:20:29| the clerk, does padlock the doors, there are signs that go up on the building, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| statute under that gives them that power to do that, so I mean, you know, it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| of a, you're way down the road when you get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Yeah, I assure you, Commissioner, if we start padlocking doors, the media will know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| It's kind of hard to padlock a door with, you know, police officers standing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and it's not a pretty sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Mr. Arnett, with no audits performed, how sure are you that that figure you gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| on collections is accurate and people haven't been shorting us the whole time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| That's not the question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Those are the numbers they turned in, those are the checks they wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| So, we know, and we don't have any way, I think any county clerk would tell you across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| the state, you have to trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I don't know how many rooms they ran out, and that's why we've got the auditor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| we're bringing on board at the suggestion of the audit that was done, and I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| I guess I was saying in the past, since we haven't done any audits, we don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| they are reporting accurately because we haven't been there to check on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| We don't know that anybody reports accurately anyway, unless we do those audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| We haven't done the audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| They're not bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| We're going to start doing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| You said you were looking at hiring a contractor to do four audits quarterly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| That would be 16 audits a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Do you think that's often enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Yes, sir, I do, because I think once these folks, and I think, let me say this, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| I think the majority of Knox County taxpayers, business-wise, or you have business tax or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| hotel-motel tax, I think they're honest, fair people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I think they are turning over that pass-through tax, like the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| I want to believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| If the audits show differently, then we'll go a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| But at some point, Commissioner, you've got to trust in people that they're telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| I'm a Ronald Reagan fan, so I'll go with trust and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| And that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| It's a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I don't have all the answers, Commissioner, but if somebody suggests something that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| think will help my office, suggest away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Mr. Robertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| I'm getting my exercise in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| You might want to stay closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| You had said that several counties, I think Hamilton and Davis, had on-staff auditors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Yeah, they do it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Do you know at what rate they audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| I want to say Hamilton County audits every hotel every year, is what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Now Davidson County samples, and that stuff's out online and I can share it with you, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| I think that's the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Sevier County, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| I talked to the finance director last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I want to say they do a thorough, full audit, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| I don't know that they sample up there, although now that I've said that, I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| they could possibly audit everybody every year, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| I'm not saying they had 100 auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| They got more campgrounds than we got hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| You done, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Foster, just two final questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| The audit that your auditor's going to do, is this going to, maybe it won't be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| for using Andrew to do these again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Our internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| She can verify their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| I mean, I would welcome the internal auditor doing it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| I mean, I'll take all the help I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| I think it's a way of allocation, and if you look, and I'm not disputing what my friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| from CTAS said, but I'd find it hard to believe that Chattanooga would have an audit staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| big enough to audit every hotel, motel, and campground every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| I mean, Bill Knowles down there does a fantastic job, but my staff's not big enough to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| I don't have the personnel that have the knowledge to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| If this commission thinks we need to do that, then let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| We're going to have to find some money somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| But it'd be the same type of audit that Andrew just finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| I'm not an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| I talked to Hugh Holt, and he gave me the name of a very good audit firm that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| would know in a second if I told you, but we haven't signed the papers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| Well, I think you're definitely on the right track here, and I agree with you that once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| the word gets out, you know, it's just kind of like a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| They test the limits sometimes, but once they know the reins have been pulled in and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| being watched, I think that you're going to see a big turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| I fully would expect at least half of those within the first six, eight months are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| to be caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Well, I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I mean, my goal is not to shut these places down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| My goal is to get what's owed the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| If they owe it, pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| I mean, it's not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| When I took office, we started making some businesses pay that had never paid business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| tax before, and I was cussed out by some of the most prominent people in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| and I just said, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| You owe the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| That's the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Foster, a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| I can't, well, in a statement, I can't imagine being able to audit all 100, what was it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| 111?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Holy smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| How much would an audit cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Does anybody know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Have we heard that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Do we have an idea of how far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| You know, Bob, excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I'm not really sure that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| I think, Peggy, would you know how much an audit would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I think we need to figure out what we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| Let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| And, you know, I'm curious as to whether whoever these people are that have not paid, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| their reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| I mean, are they protesting something that Knox County does or is not doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| I would like to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| And if we audit somebody, and this is, I guess, for Bud, is it okay to tell who we've audited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| or is that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Under this particular act, it talks about that no agency, no employee of the agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| that receives tax information shall disclose that information or you're running into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| felony situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| I just wonder if we audit somebody and we say they're honest that that makes them look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| They get some brownie points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| So, I think you're headed in the right direction, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I think 94% is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| And I think we just need to let these people know we're going to do some surprise audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| and I think people start getting some different ideas as to what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| I think you're right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| And, you know, I hope they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| And, you know, it's like I told Commissioner Smith, at some point we have to trust people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| And I'm glad to hear the law director say that because I don't want to go to prison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| with you unless I get the top bunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Chris, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| To answer Commissioner Thomas' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| The auditors, it would be agreed upon procedures and it would be an hourly rate, so it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| to depend on how much time it takes to do those audits that they randomly select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| Do we have a ballpark on the current contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| I guess it's an hourly contract and not a four audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| I think he talked to Larry Elmore with Pew, which is our current auditors, and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| he's preparing something as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Okay, so we don't know a ballpark yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Not yet, but now you know who the audit company is, which I don't think is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I want to clarify the statement because I made a broad generalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| There are those exceptions that I mentioned earlier whereby if you follow the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| and you post that it's disclosed, there are also the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| and the District Attorney's Office whereby this information can be gained and it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| be disclosed depending upon prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| There are a few exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| The auditor can gain that information but cannot disclose that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| So as far as a practical statement of what we're talking about, we don't have anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| that can let the information go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| All right, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| I guess my issue of concern is the 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| I don't know what we're basing it off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| If we're leaving, it's like a bunch of at-home tests that you send and you get to grade it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I mean, there's no basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| It might be 94, which, I mean, you know, if we're collecting property tax at 98 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| because that's what's owed the county, that should be our minimum goal for a hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| tax where you're collecting the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| It's thievery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| It's stealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| They can be good people, but they're stealing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| And I think we got a different approach where they're businessmen and ladies, so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| they're honorable, but that's not their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| That's money that we, Knox County, are charging those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| So when we talk about our revenue streams and them being flat, and we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it's like, you know, we're giving them a pass because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| they're honorable, trustworthy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Or maybe they are, maybe they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Maybe they're trustworthy at the 90 percent, and we're only, this 94 percent is only based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| off of 90 percent of heads in beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| So I don't know what an audit, to me an audit is an isolated event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| You're not going to audit every night at every hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| That's not what I think Chattanooga, these other places are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| So this audit could be just a random, but if a hotel knows one day in this 365 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| someone's going to show up and ask me to open up my books, that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| So I like to trust, but verify, you know, Reagan's statement, and it's how we collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1896)|
| 0:31:46| taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I mean, if you leave it up to folks' good nature, I just don't think the county's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| served that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| And these funds, every year budget time, we go through these hotel-motel tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| and they help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| They help run the business of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| And I think we're just willy-nilly blowing off $100,000 here, $400,000 there, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| is disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We need to, with all due diligence, if you hired a $60,000 a year job to bring in $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| I say that's a pretty good return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| So again, there's all kinds of things we could do to encourage our hoteliers to comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And I hope we're going to do more than 16 random checks in a year when we know this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| money our internal auditor has told us we're not doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| And I think you've said we don't know how well we're doing because we don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| So I think we need to get very aggressive on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I would hope that we get a lot more aggressive in our collection of these taxes because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| are stealing money from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Commissioner Bratton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Mr. Chairman, may I respond to that very quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Commissioner, at the beginning, I told you all we're sending out the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| We're going after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And I've talked to Mr. Armstrong, and we're using every law that we can use to go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| So I don't know what else we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| If, you know, if someone has a better idea, I'd love to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| But I've got to work within the constraints of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| We've sent out two letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We're sending out six more this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| That's all I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Legally, that's all I can do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| You can audit more than 16 hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| If we can afford it, Commissioner, we certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| We can't afford not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I guess I'm saying I think you need to look at the other half of this paradigm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| We're losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I think we've all established that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| When you say you can't afford, I can't afford $50 to make $400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Oh, you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Go ahead, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| I came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| The audit that was performed by the Internal Audit Department, Susan did it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2045)|
| 0:34:17| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I think Susan did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| I was just trying to get a hold of her to see how much time she spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| That's what I was asking, how long she spent doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| It was two or three months, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Well, we're talking about hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I mean, she didn't spend, how long did you spend in a hotel and do those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| That's the point I was trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| She did do 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| I asked her to text me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| It's a difference in 44 samples and 44 12-month audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I'm wondering if the clerk's office can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| We have hired additional people in the Internal Audit Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| If they could be an assistance and do what they did this year, every year, if they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| enough time and workforce in that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| That was an ordered audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I don't think that's in the current workflow for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Isn't this supposed to be done every three years through Internal Audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| I don't know the rules of Internal Audit on that, as far as accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| We can set those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| I thought that there was a set amount of time that this is supposed to be done every so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| often through Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Maybe that's something that Andrea and Foster can work out together and come up with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| She and I have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Commissioner, I'd welcome an audit as often as we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I don't have anything to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| It's almost sounding like people are thinking that I'm hiding something and I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| I told the Internal Auditors, thank you for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I want this office to run as smoothly and best as we can under my administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| I'm not saying you're trying to hide anything, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I'm just saying that I think that assists you, this audit did assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Absolutely, that's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| If there's any way that relationship continues, it will be of help to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| And I've got documents where I've written Susan Johnson, and I said, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Anything else you can do to help us, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| That train's left the station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| I want all the help I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| As I said, Randy, I did try to get a hold of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| She was not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I think the best thing we could do here is that get with Andrea and see how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| she spent doing each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| There's different ways to do an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| You can go in, once you've done, if she's done 44 of them, you can go in, and one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| can in a half a day, and hit the highlights and know if they need to go deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| That may be one thing we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| So I think right now we need to coordinate that with Foster and maybe discuss this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| As far as hiring an auditor, you're not going to get one for 50 grand that can do this kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| It just wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I don't think our lowest paid one up there is that low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| But anyway, I think that's what we need to do, is get with her and find out what timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| we're looking at to do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| I would agree with Foster, as many as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| If it means using her, in the meantime, did you get a price from your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| I called Hugh Holt and talked to Hugh, and he gave me the gentleman's name at Pew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| As Chris said, he's working on that right now at Pew to give us an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| And then, maybe it's not this month we find out, maybe it's next month we get to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| But I think we need to work with those two and have them work together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2282)|
| 0:38:12| Commissioner Albee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| When they did this audit, did the businesses that didn't, or owe this back taxes, or didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2297)|
| 0:38:27| pay their taxes, are they aware of this before your letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Usually when an audit goes through, they kind of get in...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Commissioner, I don't, to be totally honest...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I'm not saying anybody came out and told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I'm just saying, you know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| It's been publicized in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| It's a matter of public record, but I would assume they know, but you know what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| when you assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| I just, I think they kind of know it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| I'd say you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| And even before your letters, I mean, usually when you go through an audit, you get an indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| what they tell you that you're missing or you're not, you don't have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| So I think they kind of know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I'm in agreement that I think we need whatever resources we can give you, any help we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| If it means, you know, finding more money under the couch cushions, then that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| I mean, because we need to get these taxes collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| And I mean, I'd like to be able to go back, I think five years or six years as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| you can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| It'd be nice to go back and collect anything that's passed that we can gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| I think it's six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So, but I'm in full support and if, if I can help in any way or this body can help, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| surely support anything along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| We'll take all the help we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| I don't know if it was Mr. Donella or Mr. Witt and one of their articles said there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| was four properties that owned the, owed the balance to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| I don't know what you're making reference to, Mr. Donella is here if you want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Does anybody, did anybody read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| That there was four properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| I believe that was Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Well, are you, are you aware, let me rephrase the question, are you aware of the top four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| properties that own the most money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| I do not know their names, no, sir, but I do, I am aware of the amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I didn't want to know the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| No, sir, but we, we're sending letters to them and, and trust me, we're going after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| So your department has 111 properties that owe taxes to Knox County, but you have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| idea who's up to date or who is delinquent of those 111 properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| Yes, sir, we, yes, sir, we have those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| That's what Mr. Adderhall does for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| So he's got those records and I can go get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| He can tell you who the top four are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Yes, sir, he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| So, if you wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| We're going after, we went after the top two last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| You personally visited them or just sent them a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| No, sir, we sent them the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| We're following the law, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Do you think it would have been worth a personal visit to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| We're following the law, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| It says to notify them by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Let me ask you this, Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I was at a community meeting last Thursday night in my district and several citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| came up to me and asked, are you up to the task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| So how would you like me to respond to them regarding this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| That's up to you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| I think you can look at my record at the clerk's office and see what we've done, collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| more motel taxes in the history of Knox County, fiscal year 2000, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| So that's up to you how you want to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| They're asking me about you, not about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| No, Commissioner, that is your opinion, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Okay, so you're confident that you're doing 100 percent job in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| If I'm not doing what needs to be done, there's an election in three years and someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| can take this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| I'm proud of what we're doing, proud of my employees, and we're doing all we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| And I would hope that CTAS would agree, I would hope our law director would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| We're going by the law, by the book, to collect this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| I think I'm up to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I know I'm up to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Since the news has broken the media about this, has anybody else came forward and paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| their delinquent tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Apparently, not any of the big delinquents, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2551)|
| 0:42:39| Okay, and so the process is you send a letter, 10 days, you can go...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| No, sir, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| After 30 days, you can go post and lock the doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| On September 15th, if we haven't heard, we'll go lock the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| And you've sent to the two of the top four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Two of the top six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| How many in total are 30 days behind delinquent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2582)|
| 0:43:14| About 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| When will the letters be going out to the other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| As I said, Commissioner, this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| I'd said that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| They're going out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| I just wonder what your feeling is about this since this has been brought to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| And would any of this be going on if it had not been made public by the reporters that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| this money was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| I can assure you that, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| And the reason is, is that we've had a change in our business tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| And Mr. Adderholt is very good at what he does, and he's seen some things that he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| brought to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| And yes, this would have happened regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| And the audit...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Well, I mean, so you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I guess the other part of that is what you're doing right now would be the same thing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| were doing prior to this being made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Because like I said, we've had a change in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| And Mr. Adderholt has found some things that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| And that's since it's been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| This has become public, that the change in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| It was before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| He came on before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| And when the audit...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| I mean, I'm all for that audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| And if we can make changes, if we need to make changes, I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Let me go back and kind of set a timeline, so it's my little simple brain thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| So you had the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| You made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| All of this became public about the hundreds of thousands of dollars that's not being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| Have you made any changes since that was made public in the newspapers, TV, or radio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| No changes since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| So you're doing what you normally would be doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Why do you think Chattanooga, or Hamilton County, Davidson County, and these other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| are doing so well, or are doing the programs that they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| And why haven't we looked at putting that in place in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I have talked to Mr. Knowles in Hamilton County about it, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| And currently, we don't have the staff to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| I made a conscious decision when I came on board in 2008 because we were grossly overstaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| And so I made the decision to cut the staff and be more efficient to Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| So if we need to change it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| In going back and looking now, your understaff, was that a mistake by cutting those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| I don't think it was a mistake, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| I think, you know, with Mr. Aderholt on board, bringing the outside audit firm on, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| talked to Mr. Caldwell about this, I think that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| I mean, we can stand up here all day and beat a dead horse, no offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| But I think we need to look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And you know, I've told you what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| I told you what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| I'm proud of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| And we're going to collect the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| And I hope we can do it without closing hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| So you collect 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| We keep 2% of the money we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| You had a chart earlier that numbers gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| Yes, sir, every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| But you've cut staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| I cut staff when I first came into office, Commissioner, seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| So seven years ago, you were making even way less than what you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| I would have to go look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| But yes, sir, I'd say that's, I mean, since this year is a record year, I'd say we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| make less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| And there's the chart right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| So what's happening to that extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Since you've cut staff, since 2010 time frame, 2008, we're up a couple of three, four million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| dollars, who knows what it was in 08, and we had a pretty bad time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| So what's happening to those extra millions of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Well, the extra millions, you'd have to ask Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| We don't have millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Well, what's, what about the hundreds of thousands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| That goes into our operational budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I think he's talking about the excess that you've collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| The excess fees are turned over to the county general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| The excess fees that we have turned over, and you all didn't ask for that, so I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| bring it, but that's in the millions as well that we've turned over to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| So I guess my question is, so you're turning over more of the hotel, motel tax portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| of that to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| 98%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| You're holding 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| And that 2% has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| And what's, my initial question was, and you've cut staff in this arena that the 2% went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| allocate in 08 when you came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| What's happening to those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| They go to excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| They go to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| So they're going back to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Could I get the number of dollars since 08 that we've kept from, that you've kept, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2884)|
| 0:48:13| that you've turned back into the county of the 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| We've got about 12 minutes, and so I'd like to have about a 5-minute break before we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So Commissioner Busseler, and then if we get to Brown, we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| I've got a question about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| We heard this thing that sometimes we've got to trust the individual to pay their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| and I kept thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| How did they report the extra taxes that they collected when they did their yearly income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| tax forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Did they report it as a liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Did they report it as income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| How did they do it on their books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Were they legal in doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I mean, that extra money that you said is liability, we're going to put it over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| and how did they use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Are they holding it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| There's some way that if they're not reporting it, they've got to report it someplace that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| they got that extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| So it doesn't seem like to me they're being awful honest to us out there by not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| that, and to me, that would be if they misrepresented that money on their income tax forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2960)|
| 0:49:28| That's kind of a big offense, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| Is that correct, or am I assuming something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| Like you said, when you assume something, we know what that is, but are we assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| that they reported that money correctly to the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| That's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| We don't deal in federal prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| But the thing there is, wouldn't that kind of scare you if you were doing business, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| while we're talking about it, and said, hey, did you report that right to the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Wouldn't that be kind of an incentive for them to pay it, if we mentioned that to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| One quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Number one, John, I have full faith and confidence in Foster that he'll get this job done, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| Mr. Brantley, I think that the change was made after the audit, and that's when we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| got after this thing gung-ho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| The changes weren't made after they were made public, but after the audit was done, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| he gets the first copy of it, and also, again, as I say, I have full faith that he will collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| it, and Chris Caldwell would be tickled pink to get 8% on his money anywhere, on our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3044)|
| 0:50:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| If there's no other questions or anything like that, Wesley, thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| I appreciate you offering your assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| So what we'll do is we'll take a break until 5 o'clock and go into work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3061)|
| 0:51:12| All right, commissioners, if you'll make your way to your seat, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I'll go ahead and get the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3074)|

| 0:51:33| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3093)|

| 0:51:35| This is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3095)|

| 0:55:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| We thought we might have a couple of the contracts ready today, but Mr. Sturkey and the law departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| said we'd be better off if we just deferred all of them to September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| You want to wait until September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3317)|

| 0:55:27| And just to confirm, you should have now, Jill, should have provided you numbers for items 37 and 38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| so you should have contract numbers for both of those items, and just confirm the addition of item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3332)|

| 0:59:55| if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3595)|

| 1:00:18| 21 is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3618)|

| 1:00:24| Yes, special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| I think I was at the meeting a couple months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| when this was all approved for the outside counties to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| This funding, they're paying us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| We don't have to provide transportation or anything like that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Or are they responsible for their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| No, so item 21 is different from the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Item 21 is for a student who is vision impaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| who currently lives in Rhone County for us to provide educational services to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| It's something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| We have a number of students that are visually impaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| and so we do it and we can do it fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| We can do it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| But they would tuition the student into us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Otherwise, the student would have to probably go to the school for the blind in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| and so it's in the best interest of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Yeah, I'm not against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| But the transportation is – we do not provide the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| I didn't know if that was including the transportation or not in this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| This is Missy Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3683)|

| 1:01:33| and they can get better services down here than probably up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| The fees that you see are for the visually impaired, the regular classroom teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| a proportionate share of that regular classroom teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| and then the materials and supplies cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| The Rowan County will provide transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| And then we have written into the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| should the student need any additional services through the IEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| we would consult with them and that would result in an increase in the amount that they would pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| So they provide door-to-door transportation for the student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| And where do they actually end up going to then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| What location then to the regular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| It's one of the Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Item number 22 is a resolution approving an agreement with the North City Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| to enroll transfer students at the L&N STEM Academy for the term of July 1, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| through June 30, 2016, resolution 213.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Does she need to go ahead and read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| No, I think the same answer is going to apply to all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Let's just do them all at once, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| We won't have any questions on the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Does it have to be read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| She's got to read them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Go ahead and ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| My question is Dr. McIntyre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| We have students coming from Lunar City, from Monroe County, and Union County to the STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3783)|
| 1:03:14| The STEM Academy was set up for Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| Commissioner, the L&N STEM Academy was designed from the outset to be primarily for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| school students, but from the beginning had a regional component built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| So from the very beginning, the design of the school was to include up to 20% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| students from other school districts in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| 20%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Up to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| And that was the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| We received a lot of startup funding from the state and from the race of the top dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| and from the state's STEM network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| And all of that was predicated upon it having a regional component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| And, of course, that was all approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| And actually, those grants would have been approved by the County Commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| So if you had 90% of your total population apply from Knox County, 10% of them would be cut out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| even though Knox County is paying the freight for the building and teachers and all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| So the design of the model is that there would be no additional – that the cost of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| who are coming from out of county would be borne by the sending district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| By which district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| By sending district, whoever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| If it's Lenore City or Jefferson County or wherever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| And including the cost of the technology that the student would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| So there's no additional cost to the taxpayers in Knox County for that component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| But, again, from the outset, this was meant to be what's called a platform school for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| It's supposed to be a model for STEM education for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| And there was a regional component to it from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| And that's how we got a lot of the – I shouldn't say that's how we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| That was the design from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| And a lot of the funding that we received to help with startup was predicated upon that premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| My concern is if there is a Knox County student who qualifies and applies to STEM Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| they might not get in because somebody's going to come from Monroe County or Union County or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| Yeah, we have a wait list right now for the Illinois STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| It's been an unqualified success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| We're providing an outstanding education to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| And we have a wait list right now that's substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| But, again, from the very beginning, the design of that school was to have up to 20% of the seats to support a regional component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3939)|
| 1:05:48| Right now it's – you know, we've had – I think we had three students last year from out of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| And this coming year we might have as many as 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| So it's much, much less than 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| But that was the design from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| And, of course, there's no additional cost to the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| That cost is completely borne by the sending district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| But that's been the design from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| The cost they pay per child, is it enough to cover the cost per child of the Knox County students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3972)|
| 1:06:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| Well, I'm still concerned that if we've got a Knox County student in a Knox County school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| and we've got a Knox County school sitting over here in the L&N building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| that if a Knox County student wants to get in, they can't get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| That bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| Yes, sir. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| That really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| I don't care who's paying the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Basically, it's a Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| It is a Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| But, again, from the very beginning, the design was to have a regional component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| We received millions of dollars in support from the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| when we began the L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| We received hundreds of thousands of dollars in philanthropic support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| from various individuals and organizations in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| based on the design that we had developed, which included a regional component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| So how many students? What's your max capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| It's in the neighborhood of around 600-plus students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| So that means that you could take 120 out-of-county students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| Yes. We can take, well, I can get my calculator and do 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| In that neighborhood, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| You'll be able to do all math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Yes. In that neighborhood, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Are there any Knox County students on the waiting list now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| And you're full up with the 600?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| So when it comes time, how do you pick who's next in line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| You've got one slot open, and you've got a child from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Union County, and Monroe County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Who gets the slot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| So the way it's designed is that there are a certain number of seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| that can be utilized by outside counties, and so that's taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| If they are not utilized, then those seats can go to Knox County school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| and that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| So last year, again, we had up to 20% of the seats could have gone to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| outside of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Only three did, and so I think it's going to depend year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| I suspect, although I don't know for sure, that over time we might see more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| I don't think it's likely that we'll get to the full 20% just because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| sending district has to pay the full cost of educating the student in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| Knox County schools and because of transportation and logistical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| But, you know, might we get to 20 or 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| Sure, we probably will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Students, not percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Capacity is 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Students, not percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Oh, yeah, 20 to 25 students, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Yeah, I'm sure we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Your total student capacity is 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| What's the current enrollment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| It's about 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| I'd have to check to make sure, but it's right in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| Okay, I just want to be sure we're using that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| It might be a little bit over that, but our capacity is roughly 600,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| and we plan to have it full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| We have a pretty significant waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| and so we want to make sure that we're providing that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| to as many students as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Well, I just want to be sure that as many Knox County students can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Dr. McIntyre, is that 20% a number that we have to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| or is it a suggested number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| No, it's a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| It can be up to 20%, but it's not a number that we don't have to be at 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| We don't have any obligation to get to that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| but the design of the school allowed for up to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Again, I don't know if we'll ever get to that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| just because you're talking about really just a handful of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| We're in our fourth year, I guess going into our fifth year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| of the L&M STEM Academy, and we're only at about a dozen students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| So I suspect we won't probably get to that full 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| but we could, by design, get up to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| And I remember when the school was opened that there was that component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| I remember that was part of the sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| This is a regional school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Transportation, I read through part of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| I didn't get through all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Is it my understanding that if a student from outside, say, Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| can get a ride to one of the high schools out in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| that we provide transportation from that point on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| Yeah, Dr. Davis, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| I'm going to defer to Dr. Clifford Davis, who's our chief of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| who was our director of secondary education until recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| The contracts vary by district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| but it's my understanding that the parents would be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| transportation to the L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Do they have the option of getting them to one of the stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Again, in the memorandum of agreement with districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| the parents are responsible for transporting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| so they would have to be responsible for transporting them to the L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| L&N STEM has no bus service, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| I mean, all parents, even Knox County, are responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| No, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| We do have school bus service to L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Like with most of our magnet programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| it's sort of what we call a sort of a spoken wheel kind of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| So we have either parents or a student can ride the bus to one of our high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| and then they can take the bus to the L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| We start at 930 for the L&N STEM Academy, so it's on a different schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| so there's time for that kind of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| And then transportation home goes to certain – it doesn't go to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| it goes to certain bus stops that will be in communities or in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| not necessarily the traditional transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| which might be within a certain distance from your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| How big of a wait list do you have to get in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I'll have to check on the numbers, but it's been – this summer it's been –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| I believe it's been close to 100 this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Is there any room for further expansion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Well, if Becky Ash were here, the principal of the L&N STEM Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| she would make the pitch to help us look at the old convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| and if we were able to take possession of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| then there would be plenty of room for all comers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| But I think that's – right now we've got the L&N building, we've got the old depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| and that's laboratory space and classroom space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| I think the L&N STEM Academy has exceeded even our most wild aspirations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| in terms of a high-quality, outstanding education in the STEM disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| And so if we could identify some additional space right in that World's Fair Park area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| we'd love to be able to at some point expand and provide that opportunity to more kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| All right. Sam, you're done? Okay. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Not a question, I'm going to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| At the Board of Education meeting when this was discussed, these contracts were discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| the superintendent received the same grilling as we've tried to give him here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| only we were not nearly up to the task as the members of the Board of Education were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| The one thing that I think I'd like to say about it is I think that the numbers of pupils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| at the L&M STEM that are picked by blind lottery, so that that then leaves the wait list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4419)|
| 1:13:50| I believe I'm speaking now in rumor, but I think talking to Principal Ash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| that the numbers of students coming from out of county will be in addition to what she was trying to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| for those that were picked by blind lottery inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| So that from the Knox County process, all of the students inside Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| that were going to be serviced by the school will still be serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| And if we have two, three, or 12 come from out of county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| she's going to do the best she can to make sure that those students are seated also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| with all of the allotment that was going to go to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Now I'm going to look to the superintendent and see if he's going to say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| He's saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So these contracts do not affect really in a direct way those from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| that were going to get into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| All right. Commissioner Rott made the motion, I made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4492)|

| 1:16:00| A resolution approving a construction contract in the amount of $269,581.88| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| with the blunt excavating for the Metacrest subdivision drainage improvements resolution 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4567)|

| 1:16:21| It is a replacement of a 60-inch culvert corrugated metal pipe that has had a lot of degradation over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| Jim and Brian Hubbs have been out there numerous times making repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| It was just overdue to be replaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| and we're also reciting it to put it within the platted drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| because some of it is actually outside the platted drainage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Other than that, it's pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| It's a big pipe and a big project, hence the big number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| but there's not really anything complicated or unusual about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4605)|

| 1:17:19| Dwight, you said you're going to put a red light at the Pellissippi West entrance right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| I'll let Jim speak to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| He's been involved in it up to his ears for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| Is this signalization and lane improvements over there or what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4655)|

| 1:18:35| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| We're actually looking at multi-awarding that to a couple different staffing agencies in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| to ensure that we can get a quantity of nurses that we'll need for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| So no contracts have been signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| No contract at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Do you know when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Is it like next week or next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Purchasing is evaluating them now, and I think they've completed that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and is pushing the contracts to the law office at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| so I'm not sure if they'll have them this week or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| We'll do no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4749)|

| 1:19:15| If you don't, we'll push it off a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4758)|

| 1:19:55| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Commissioner Owen, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4798)|

| 1:20:00| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Is this going to be, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| are we going to own that and then we'll contract out the services inside of it later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| or is it Helen Austin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Yes, you're correct, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Yes, how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Pull your mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| How many would this service, this size building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| That question probably would be more appropriately answered by Helen Austin McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Jerry Wagner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| but I will tell you there's approximately 7,300 square feet in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| and that works out to be about $150 a square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| which is a pretty good price in today's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| Are we required to provide these services in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| These are services that I understand that we are required to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| and HRM is in a better position to provide them than the county itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4858)|
| 1:21:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Where are these people being held or being treated or housed now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| There are two shelters currently in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| two disclosed locations, obviously, but that's where they're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| We need more beds, if that's your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Yeah, just a quick question because I want to make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| The building's already there and we're just refurbishing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| No, it is a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Oh, it's going to be a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4891)|

| 1:21:42| The old admin building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4902)|

| 1:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4904)|

| 1:22:28| And there will be a list by fund, and it will tell the purpose of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| And I guess depending on what we estimate our budget surplus to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| it will depend on the amounts that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=4960)|

| 1:23:56| to enter into a payment in lieu of tax with America's Collectible Network, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| doing business as Jewelry Television with respect to certain property located at 9600 Parkside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| and 505 North Peters Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922, resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5048)|
| 1:24:16| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5056)|

| 1:24:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Mr. Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Just here to answer any questions, tell you a little bit about the project itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| and also I want to point out that Charlie Wagner and Kevin Cowart, both of Jewelry Television, are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| But I'm here on behalf of the County Industrial Development Board of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| and as the motion reads, it's their request for approval for a 10-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| They considered this and approved it last week at their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| contingent upon county commission's concurrence with that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| But it's a really exciting company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Jewelry Television has been headquartered here for a very long time, and they've had their ups and downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| But, you know, they employ over 1,200 full-time employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| and they account for $59 million in payroll and benefits in Knox County, so it's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| This project will allow them to do some expansion here and invest, here we've got my number here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5116)|
| 1:25:25| of about $42.5 million in acquisition, which I think is a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| Currently they lease their existing locations, and you've got a company here saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| we like Knox County, we want to continue to be in Knox County, want to do it for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| and we just need some help continuing to keep ourselves strong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| So part of that is they're going to be adding 30 IT jobs, which allows them to remain efficient in what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| So there's property acquisition, there's about $11 million in building improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| $6.2 million in automation, about $13.5 million in IT infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| So, you know, and then part of it is they've also said we're committing to continue to maintain our operations in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5166)|
| 1:26:15| as our primary point of operations, our call centers, our headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| And, you know, as excited as I am about the 30 jobs and the board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| really excited about the fact that they've got almost 1,200 full-time employees here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| with $59 million in payroll and benefits, and committed to staying here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| and buying property versus leasing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| So this is a win-win opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| It's probably one of the more exciting ones from my perspective and what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| in the form of growing and retaining jobs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I won't say a whole lot more about that, but, you know, if you've got some specific questions about Geordie Television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| you know, what their plans are, I would certainly defer to the folks that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Is this a call center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Is that what's going to take this plot of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| They're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| They're already operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Is this an expansion of the call center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| These are 30 IT jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| These are IT infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| They're not call centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| They're averaging $82,000 a year in wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| They're buying the buildings they're currently sitting in is what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| And my question, how long is the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| You know, I applaud any business that wants to stay here, but, you know, these ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| I just look at these pilots for, you know, big deals, and I know you all are out there shopping for the big deals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5258)|
| 1:27:50| and this is okay, but, you know, I just, again, strongly encourage you to bust some big fish in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5270)|
| 1:28:02| I understand these IT jobs, but when you look at call centers, we've got a lot of call centers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| So I'm just hoping that that will attract some higher paid skilled workers, blah, blah, blah positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5289)|
| 1:28:20| Can I respond to that a little bit, Commissioner Quincy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| Certainly there's a call center component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| It's a large component of this, but they've got gemologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| They've got very high paid individuals, a lot of them including IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| So it takes ‑‑ it's not just a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| That is a component of what they do here, and I would certainly classify this as a huge fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| Maybe it's not brand new to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| but it's a company that we can work with is making a 10‑year commitment guarantee to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5325)|
| 1:28:53| and, you know, $59 million plus in benefits and payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| and then putting themselves in a position that makes them competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| Just really, I am excited about this, and I think it's just a great win‑win opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| and I think we have to look at it in the total package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| Todd, I think to add to your statement, I think having another national headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| international headquarters here is significant for Knoxville, so I think that has something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| Go ahead over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| I will replow just a portion of the ground you gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| They are here, but the most important thing to me is the fact that they came here from Greenville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| I just thought that, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| They came here from Greenville, and they're leasing real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| and making this 10‑year commitment to buy real estate, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| puts us in a good way of keeping them hooked for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| where if this deal does not come to fruition, they may look for a better deal somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| So I'm in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Would I be correct in supposing that if we don't do this, they're not leaving, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5420)|
| 1:30:29| I don't believe that they've threatened to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| but I certainly think it makes it more difficult for them to make the investment here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| that keeps them profitable here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| And there's some other business risks that they're willing to forego a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| related to some potential sales tax issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| So, you know, I don't think they're threatening to leave, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| and I don't believe that's the kind of people they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| I believe that what we have to talk about is the fact that this locks them into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| definitely going ahead and making a commitment to acquire the properties that they have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| And as Commissioner Wright says, a big part of it, when you have a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| that doesn't have much in the way of hard real estate physical investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| it makes it pretty easy to potentially relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| We do have companies in Knox County that are constantly being courted by other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| and for lots of very good reasons they stay here, but it's always something we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| Well, I'm certainly for it in the fact that there's so many employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| and it's a big part of that part of the county for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| But normally you would do this for a new business coming into the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| someone who's been here for some time and held lots of different real estate, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| That's correct, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| And then what it is, based on the investment the jobs are creating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| they do qualify under our pilot program under seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| and they're asking for some additional help for this additional commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| But we're not setting a precedent for other people who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| look, I'm having a little problem here, I need some help to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| I don't believe we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| The precedent was set long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| Yes, where are the gentlemen with the jewelry television?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Hey, I want to say thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Not here, but here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| We're really glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| I think the point I really think is important that we should know here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| is the business they're in, they could be doing it from anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| They could be in Alaska and you'd never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| I mean, it's not dependent on a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| It's not dependent on where they are in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| And it's so great that they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| And so I'm 100% for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| And I'm just tickled to death that you all are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Because you could be anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| It wouldn't make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| The question was, are we thinking about leaving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| No, we're not thinking about leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| We don't want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| We do have a 20% partner from abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| As we go forward, we are always contemplating strategic partnerships and arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| Our management would like to have our real estate owned here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| that if a strategic partner came along that we say, we're here in Knoxville, we're committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| And I think this arrangement and us buying the real estate, spending the money on the real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| gives us that answer when we start through this process with a strategic partner in a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| hey, don't consider taking us somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| Now, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Todd, with 1,200 employees, where does that rank them in the Knox County area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| Boy, I should have looked that number up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| I've got to believe they're certainly in the top five or six in Knox County, if not higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| I'll tell you what, I'll look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| I can look the book a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I'm sure it's going to be way up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| One of the things I really like about this is you look at their business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| This is a company that's not competing with the mom and pops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| And sure, you could go buy your jewelry from them instead of going to one of the local markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| But as Commissioner Thomas pointed out, they could be in Canada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| and people from Knox County could still be buying their stuff from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| How many other locations do they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| They have, go ahead, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| By the way, do we need his name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| I'm Charlie Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| I live at 4076 Alta Vista Way in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| Lived there for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| We have one major operation in Bangkok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| We have a sourcing operation there that does several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| It sources product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| A lot of our gemstone product comes out of the Asian market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| And in addition, we have no manufacturing abroad, but we do have a contract with manufacturers abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5724)|
| 1:35:34| And our office in Bangkok reviews that, does quality control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| and sources those deals to make sure that we get kind of what we've done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| We started out as a closeout operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| But as we outgrew the closeouts that are available, we had to start manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| And we're all about value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| And that allows us, our supply chain allows us to really provide our customers with great value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5760)|
| 1:36:11| So everything here is just at the Parkside Drive location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| Everything is at the Parkside Drive location except that one outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| Now, we do have, like the call center, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| We have remote call center agents that may be in Knox County or may be elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| We have developed software where we can have kind of interruptible power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| that comes in when we have an overload that can pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| We have actually contemplated doing a major store in Pigeon Forge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| that would have a production component there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| So I don't want to say that necessarily over the next ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| that everything will always be 100% in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| but our headquarters location will certainly be in Knox County, and this will be our main spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| And you guys have done a great job with your athletic fields for the employees and that there at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| We did get an Orchid Award for that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| We took an area that was not utilized at all, and in addition to building parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| we took about four acres and, frankly, spent about a half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| and built a walking trail and a volleyball court, and we have a wellness center there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5859)|
| 1:37:47| that we have a nurse practitioner that serves our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| and in addition, a workout facility for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| So we do work real hard to make it a nice place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I have a question maybe for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| How many of the 1,200 employees are call center workers, and how many are that 82,000 kind of corporate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| We have about 400 full-time call center employees, 200 or 300 part-time call center employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5896)|
| 1:38:26| I do want to state that the new jobs that we're talking about are all technical jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| and they're at roughly $82,000 a year, which is about 180% of the average wage in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5913)|
| 1:38:42| So that's a national recruitment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| Our company is pretty much run on IT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| and part of the expenditures that we're going to be making here is for that advanced technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5929)|
| 1:39:01| Commissioner Brantley, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you, Mr. Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5943)|

| 1:39:06| We appreciate the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5950)|

| 1:39:16| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| On page 14, item number 54 is a resolution concerning taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| and the disposal of surplus real property owned by the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| and located at 625 North Broadway, CLT number 094DP013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5964)|
| 1:39:32| This is resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Is Hugh still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Hugh, are you the appropriate questions for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| This is the property on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| I think this is the one that's negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| This is a city tax property that also has some delinquent county tax properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| This is just a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| We have to tell the city, like the city tells us at city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| that we'll forgive the taxes moving forward so they can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| And then we get our prorated portion of whatever the proceeds are from the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Bob, is this the dry cleaners that Mr. Wetzel, is this the dry cleaners that was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Is that what that building is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| Bob Wetzel, City of Knoxville's Office of Redevelopment, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| It's the old dry cleaners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| It's been vacant, doesn't have a roof, and it's got all sorts of environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| It's a gem of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| It's on the market, and there's an RFP out for it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| so we're hoping this will help move it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6039)|

| 1:41:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Thanks, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| So is this a start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| You know, I've been trying to push the Magnolia into the part of Magnolia that hurts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| you know, in terms of that is hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| So is this a start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| And we've been talking about this for a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| This is certainly the Magnolia Warehouse Redevelopment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| You would normally think of it more as part of the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| Yeah, it's the old city in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| I would mention, we did a pilot up here you'd be more concerned with, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| very close to Standard & Eddy Mill just two weeks ago at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6105)|

| 1:42:00| We had a pretty lengthy discussion last month about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Is there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6122)|

| 1:42:11| It would be a 15-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Six-something million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| No, it's about a $4.8 million investment up to $600,000 in TIF financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6135)|
| 1:42:23| I would remind you just as a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| for the last five years for the big, major one of these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| you've got no taxes at all out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| As soon as they close on the deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| you'll get back five years of taxes on that one at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6150)|

| 1:43:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| We'll go ahead and get Mark Miller to come up and give his brief comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6212)|
| 1:43:39| so we can cut him loose, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| We just want to make sure you had a copy of our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| We do it on a fiscal year, 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| We just think it's important that you be kept informed about what we do to keep people healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| and improve quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| And to that end, we've created our annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| which talks a little bit about what we do and some of our accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| And if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Any questions for Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| On page 16, this is item number 57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| discussion regarding meeting time of the zoning portion of the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| Dr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| You said Dr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Geez, I got promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| For at least the last four months, our commission meeting has been over as early as 5-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6281)|
| 1:44:53| and certainly I can't remember one no later than 5-50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| which leaves us at least an hour, an hour and a half before zoning times with dead time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| So my proposal is that we change the meeting time of the zonings to 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| or immediately following the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| First, I guess I'll speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| I guess first, that's come out of the Rules Committee as approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| and I guess you're looking for discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| But I think that continually changing meeting times is a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| and I think that assuming that all commission meetings are going to be less than an hour is probably a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| I mean, I hate the new schedule, but I think continually changing those meetings is probably a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6334)|
| 1:45:42| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Is there any reason it can't be after our work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| Does it have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| No, I tried that, and everybody argued about NPC schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| I tried that when we redid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| That would only make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| You're on the Rules Committee, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| Yeah, I'm Sam's chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| I think it would have to come out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| It would have to come out of there if we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| If someone wants to convene a committee meeting, I'd be glad to entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6370)|
| 1:46:17| Item number 58 is a motion and vote of the commission to mandate that the chair call a special session of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| on September the 1st, 2015, at 5 o'clock p.m. in the main assembly room of the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| for the purpose of reorganizing the commission, making appointments to various boards and committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| and electing officers to the commission's standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| I was wondering if we could move the time up earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| because that's the same evening that the Tennessee County Commissioners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| is having our regional meeting in West Knoxville from 5.30 to 8.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| and I'm sure they're expecting most of us to be in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| So is there a chance we can move that meeting to, say, 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| or how long does this procedure normally take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| Well, it generally doesn't take too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Joe Lee, can you remember, we had the room discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| I don't think I asked for 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| We looked at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| We'll try to move it to 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| It generally wouldn't take that long, but you still want to be at that meeting at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| I can entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| If the room is available, I think it is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I think there was nothing that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| Is it a Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| But it wasn't a council meeting, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| because we wouldn't have scheduled it if it was in a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| We'll check with Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| If you all will entertain that motion, I can change the time to 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| and we'll try to do that if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| And then also they would like to know a head count, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| of how many commissioners would be attending the 5.30 meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| because they're providing dinner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| Joe Lee can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| So is there a motion to convene on September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| a special call meeting to reorganize the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| So Joe Lee will try to get that at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| If it changes, we'll fix that next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Item number 60 is line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Motion to defer until next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Defer until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| Any other items to be discussed before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| Do we want to say happy birthday to Joe Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| You can sing happy birthday all you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150817?start=6529)|
