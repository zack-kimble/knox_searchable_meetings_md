| 0:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I just want to call up before we call on our officials to enlighten us on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| As a member of the Pension Board, we have discussed this for a lengthy period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| the consideration of an investment committee, the wisdom of it, and the opportunities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| it affords the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So it is something which I believe the Board feels strongly will be a very helpful tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| in working through some of the very lengthy and complicated matters that we have to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| And, yes, there has been a discussion, just to assure you that it's been well vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=605)|
| 0:10:14| of adding other members to that committee once that committee determines how things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=614)|
| 0:10:22| are going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| So it's kind of a, I guess it's a policy in progress, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| And I'm sure that Mr. Gilbert can give you the information which you feel you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| So I would like for Mr. Gilbert to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| I'm going to let Vice Mayor Becker go first, and then I'll let Mr. Gilbert come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Ms. Rutter, you said before I make an amendment, and I'm wondering, maybe I missed something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| but what would you suggest changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Well, I called Mr. Swanson's office this afternoon and spoke with Maxie about this, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| what's missing for me is if you look at the revised investment policy and you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| the table of contents in Exhibit A, one of the first sections kind of sets out and defines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| all the different moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| So there's a discussion of the board, of the trustee custodian, of the actuary, the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| counsel, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| And their roles and responsibilities are set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Throughout the policy in a number of places, this investment committee is referenced, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| yet under these definitions of board, manager, actuary, legal counsel, the investment committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| is not delineated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| And my discomfort in approving the changes to the policy, particularly the allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| of some of these investment vehicles that other public governments have gotten in trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| with across the nation, Orange County to name one, is that I think we need some folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| have a high level of sophistication with investments to vet this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| And the way the policy is written, the derivatives and swaps are allowable only with the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| of the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| And right now, the investment...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Well, the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| I would correct you to say the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| The recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| And right now, the investment committee isn't defined in the policy itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| It's called out in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| And in the resolution, the investment committee is mentioned as really as being a subset of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| It indicates it would have board members plus Mr. Cherry or the director of the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| And so the part that I want to add is specific language that there are other outside people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| on this investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| And I'm just not comfortable going forward allowing these derivative investments because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| you know, public tax...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Citizen tax dollars are at risk in the pension fund if for some reason investments don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| go as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| There is a taxpayer liability here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| And so because of my concern about these more aggressive investments, I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| some outside folks appointed, asked to serve on this investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| I don't have names in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I'm just saying people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| And so language needs to be in there to provide for the expansion of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| So what you want to do is what they intend to do, but you want to get it in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| You want to get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| I don't want to approve these...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| ...to the policy and have that safeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| And once again, I think Mr. Gilbert could be extremely helpful before we discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| So if it would be appropriate, Mayor Haslam, I would call on him at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Bud, if you'd give us your name and position maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| My name is Bud Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I'm with Kennerly Montgomery & Finley, 550 Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| And we serve as general counsel to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| And let me first applaud the councilwoman for her astuteness and careful review of this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| but also apologize for any misinformation she may have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| There's actually two committees that are being contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| only one of which is being dealt in the investment policy before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| It's the pension board's intentions to eventually have an investment council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| very much like you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| with outside people that might bring a wealth of talent to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| might include economic expertise as well as investment expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| That is not the investment committee that you read about in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| And the reason why is we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| The investment committee is a first step of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| And the intent of that committee, and it is, as you mentioned, a subset of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| is it is intended to help the pension board react more quickly to the changing investment environment that we experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| We realize on the pension board that a monthly meeting is not enough anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| if we're to be on our feet and nimble and quick and can react to the changing markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| So what was contemplated in the policy before you, and let me call it to the attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| it's in your Exhibit A if you on council have not had a chance to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| but I think it is pretty well defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Perhaps we could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| But on page three, and I'm reading from the new language at the top of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| it says, to more effectively discharge its investment responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| the pension board has established and appointed an investment committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| for the purpose of providing assistance and advice to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| on investment matters related to the fund's assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| The investment committee's functions and duties shall be delegated to the committee by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| under the committee's charter, which the board may amend from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| That charter is a three-page charter that not only tells you who serves on the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| but delineates each of the responsibilities, the limitations, and the expectations of the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Now, I might note that under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| the pension board is ultimately responsible for the investment of the fund's assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| It cannot delegate that duty to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| So the committee is only advisory and can only recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| It cannot do anything in the form of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| or a binding contractual arrangement with the City of Knoxville Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| I think what the pension board hopes to do, and certainly the mayor ably serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| and Councilwoman Pelow and Mr. York serves on that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| once they get this investment committee established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| and indeed it's been meeting since I believe May, if I'm not mistaken, monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| and they time it so it meets opposite of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| so that we're constantly interfacing with our investments consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| reviewing our investment results so that they can be on top of these investment matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| and recommend to the pension board what action they need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| But eventually that investment committee, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| intends to put the blueprints down of what this investment advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| they haven't even really named it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| and who might sit on that, how we would constitute it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and quite honestly it will probably take an ordinance of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| much more than just the investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Contemplation may need to go to a charter amendment to affect that council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| and that's something that we would look forward to working with the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| on making sure that we get right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| We'd love your input too, but we're just not ready to do the investment council yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| That's a step to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| We believe this interim step of having an investment committee, a separate committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| was needed years ago, and we're glad to put it before you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and I'd be glad to answer any additional questions if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Well, I'd just make a comment that the circumstances of the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| and economic climate of the past year has certainly represented to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| the need to have something as I believe Mr. Gilbert used the word nimble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| and to be able to react more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| We felt that there were times when it would have behooved the board to have been in a position to have acted more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1085)|
| 0:18:14| the word I really want to use won't come, but more in keeping with what was happening in the markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| and we became very concerned that if we did not make this move to add this step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| we were going to lose some opportunities and regret it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| I think this board has been remarkable, the sitting board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| in terms of its concern about its responsibility to all of the members who have funds in this pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1116)|
| 0:18:47| So that was the reason for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| It wasn't an exclusionary thing or something that was going to be clandestine or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| And I think also we have realized, and in fact we've taken advantage of, I'd say, Mr. Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| the opportunity to have much more expertise, much more outside advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and we have certainly spoken clearly to those who help us manage our funds about expectations from them to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1149)|
| 0:19:20| and reporting and so on and expeditiously doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| So this comes after a period of time when we have all been very concerned about the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| And I appreciate your concern about it because we all have a tremendous obligation and responsibility to that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| And so I just want to say for the rest of the board, which is not present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| that really they have taken these responsibilities very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| And this is the result of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Indeed, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| I might add that the first labor of the Investment Committee was to review this investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| And many of the changes before you tonight is the recommendation of the Investment Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| which went to the Pension Board first, of course, and then came to you tonight in the form of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Mr. Gilbert, I thank you for pointing out the paragraph at the top of page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| And from what I understand, the functions of the Investment Committee are already called out in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Now, I want to be clear on that, not the city charter, the committee's charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| The committee's charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| And I'd be glad to get you a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I have one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I should have perhaps made a copy for all members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| It is a three-page document adopted by the Pension Board that delineates the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| and structure of the committee, the duties, the limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| and it's all advisory and recommendation in nature to the full Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| And it would have been helpful to have that document since this Investment Committee is called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| and referenced throughout this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| And I guess I might ask that that piece become a part of this revised investment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| you know, as an appendix or something in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| However, I guess I stand by my original assertion that I am not comfortable approving this revised policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| until this investment council that you spoke of is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| And I'm delighted to know that that's something that's been considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| and I understood from Mr. Cherry and Mr. York that that was under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| I just think that we have all seen very unfortunate incidents across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| with investments that were made by very well-meaning people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| but which were not appropriate in terms of risk level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| or there was not full disclosure or understanding of the possible downside risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| I understand the need for an investment fund of this size to have the ability to consider a wide range of investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| particularly as economic conditions shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| However, I think we need some outside folks who don't have a stake on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| who don't stand to benefit from the pension fund in any way, to be another set of eyes and look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| particularly since in this revised policy it says that these type of investments can only be used with the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| And I understand it's approval of this Investment Committee, so I understand that that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| No, approval of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| The Investment Committee has no authority to approve investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| I think that it would be great for the pension board to have another set of eyes to help them in making those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| because some of these investments are very sophisticated and very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| I think your points are excellent, well taken, and would be agreed unanimously by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| The only thing I would submit for your consideration, Councilwoman, is the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| whatever we end up calling it or city council chooses to name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| I think it's going to take us a little time to get that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| And as I mentioned earlier, it may even require a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| In the meantime, this Investment Committee that we propose before you is doing good work and is doing needed work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| And I would just hate to see the work of the Investment Committee held back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| which is an aid and assistance to the pension board in being more responsive to the city and the members of this pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| And I don't think I'm talking about holding back the work of the Investment Committee at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| What I'm saying is I'm not comfortable approving the policy allowing this wider range of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| The Investment Committee can go on currently considering the type of investments that are presently allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| but I'm not comfortable going forward with this wider range of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| I guess I misheard you because I thought you stated earlier that you had spoken with folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| and had your assurances that the authority to invest in derivatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| and the various additional flexible instruments you had been satisfied, but I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| I understand the need for those flexible instruments to be tools in the toolbox for the pension fund to choose from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| in terms of their range of investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| but I don't want those tools in the toolbox unless there is a more diverse committee to consider those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1456)|
| 0:24:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Point well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Mr. Gilbert, I guess essentially the pension board is a creature of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| This committee, the Investment Committee, you say is chartered by the charter for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| It was a creature of the pension board in turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| The pension board created that charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| So that's not statutory in any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And you're saying it's simply advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Does the pension board have its own internal rules by which it must function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Has it drafted a set of rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Example being city council, you know, it has authority under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| but under section I think it's 705 of the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| The rules of council actually govern how council functions, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Is there something similar with the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| The pension board has rulemaking authority under charter section 1324 and charter section 1350.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| relative to the governance of its affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I also might mention that its rules relative to how it conducts investments is the very policy before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| because what the charter says under section 1350.2 is that city council shall give us direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| on how we conduct our investment authority, and you do that through the statement of investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| Once you speak, we have to adhere to the guidelines in these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Any deviation from that policy would be what we call an ultra varies act or outside of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| and that's why we come to you routinely to get changes for the policy so that we can keep up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| So that portion of the charter that says that city council will, I forget the language you just used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| but give guidance or something to that effect, I guess the question is, and I don't know legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1575)|
| 0:26:25| I know there's a lot of hair splitting that happens sometimes in these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| but the question is does city council have the authority to approve a policy which in turn says this is how you will function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1590)|
| 0:26:40| In other words, if there's an investment committee or an advisory council, you must or you shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1600)|
| 0:26:52| that would be the proper legal language I would guess, shall incorporate the work of this advisory council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| In other words, the advisory council would have to sign off on anything before the pension board could approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| Because you alluded to say you weren't sure maybe the charter had to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Well, excellent question, and there's a good lady up there that's smarter than I am in these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| but let me suggest this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| The charter, city charter, makes clear that the authority for investing the funds of the city of Knoxville Employees Pension System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| rests with the pension board, not with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| City council sets the parameters through the statement of investment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| but it is the pension board that has the responsibility and the liability for the investment of those procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| I understand that means that the investments don't come to city council to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| But here's where I think your question is very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Could city council pass a requirement that then affects perhaps the governance of how you invest those assets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| I think that's questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| I think, you know, you can get real close, but at some point you could be perhaps interfering with the pension board's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| and liability for investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| But that's the kind of thing that lawyers toil over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| and I'm sure that there is a place to have an investment council or whatever we name it that does include outside expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| and advice that still lets the pension board discharge its legal responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| And certainly council is right to be in this policy and to author its governance authority through the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1703)|
| 0:28:33| to direct the pension board on how we invest those fund assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Would you agree that some questions have been raised tonight that may not be adequately answered in this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| No, I think they're all excellent questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| I just think that they really apply to the investment council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and don't really have anything to do with the investment committee, which has been functioning since May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| and is already doing excellent work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| I understand, but the question still remains as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| or not the investment committee can be established under the direction of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| and whether or not it would have authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Well, see, we've really covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Within this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| The pension board has already adopted a committee charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| It's already the pension board has always had the authority to appoint its committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Sorry, the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I meant the council, not the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| The pension board has always had the authority to appoint committees of itself to carry out its functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| All they did in May was adopt an investment committee charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And then when we got around to the investment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| making the routine kind of changes that we make from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| we thought it wise to put that investment committee in this policy to show that we divide the labor, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| among different functions just as we very carefully delineate what our investment consultant does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| what our investment managers do, what our legal council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| I appreciate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| And I really want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| I don't know if Councilman Roddy wants to weigh in any more on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| I see Councilman Pilo's light on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| But I think I would defer to Councilman Roddy since she's sort of taken the lead on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| and has some excellent points and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| But I'm a little reluctant to approve something yet, given the questions that have arisen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| until we can get better answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| So I'll pass it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Well, at one point, back there somewhere, I was about to comment that I wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1824)|
| 0:30:33| being a member of a pension board and going on there at one point, new, green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| didn't know much about it and know a great deal more now about how it operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| I didn't know if there is the understanding among all of us about how we get investment advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| and that we do have advice coming to us on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| I'm just not really so sure how aware council is about the structure of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1859)|
| 0:31:09| and how advice does come down to us or if there's the thought that it just all seems to be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| that Bob has and a good idea Barbara has and a good idea Marilyn had yesterday and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| So I don't know if that would be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| but it seems to me that somehow we might not understand where we get our advisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| and where we're looking to be able to protect those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| That's an excellent point, and I don't want to bore council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| I know you folks have a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| And there may be no interest in it, but I was feeling like maybe that was missing somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| I know you folks have a lot of important work to do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| but it's in a very elaborate structure that is designed to not only protect the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| and the City of Knoxville Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| but most importantly to protect the assets that are invested for the welfare of all the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| and the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| It starts out not only with an elected and somewhat appointed pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| because some serve by virtue of their office, but then the investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| the pension board hires, first of all, an investment consultant who overrides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| is it 16 different investment managers, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| I think we have 16 different professional investment managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| that manage our assets in different disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Our investment consultant sits over those 16 managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| The investment consultant reports to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| and also those 16 managers at least once a year report back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| All of that's reviewed on a monthly and a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| And because the responsibility is so immense in this arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| and as you folks appreciate who have to pass a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| what we do at the pension board relative to investment performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| impacts what you have to come up in the way of balancing your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| This investment committee, we believe, is a very important part of being better stewards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| with the money that is entrusted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| These are volunteers that sit on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| so we ask them to take on awesome responsibility managing a multimillion dollar fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| And to better do that, to be quite honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| we're going to have to meet a lot more than once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| A lot of our folks are elected from the employee ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Some come to us with virtually no experience in the investment arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| And quite honestly, as we've evaluated our performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| and looked at some of our shortcomings, we think we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| And the investment committee was one of the tools in the toolbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| I'll borrow that expression, that the board came up with as a good first start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| of trying to get a better handle on our duties and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| and having more interface with the 16 professional money managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| and our investment consultant out of St. Louis so that we can react more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and be better at what we do and so that we can better inform our pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| So we see it as a vital thing, but obviously this is city council's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| You folks make the decision and you guide us in the form of the investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Do we have any motion on the floor right now on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| There is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| We'll have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I was going to do a little bit like Mr. Frost and sort of ask where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| because it feels like we kind of all agree on what we want to accomplish here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| and there's a little bit of a question of timing on whether we adopt this policy now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| and wait for the creation of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| or whether we wait on the policy until the creation of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| It feels like in the end we all want to be at the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| I'd kind of like to just move along and I see Ms. Roddy's light's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| and we'll ask her to suggest the next step, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Mr. Gilbert, again, I'm not taking issue with the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| I think that's a great improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I would like to see the three-page document that you referenced added to this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| which is easy to do, but I'd like to make a substitute motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| because, again, as I stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| I'm not comfortable allowing the changes that are contemplated in this revised investment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| without the extended advice of the investment council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| that you said the pension board has contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and I'm delighted that you all thought about that, where outside advice would be brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| The length of the postponement, I guess I would defer to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| in terms of how long it might take to set that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| and make sure that that's in place before these changes are put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| I'm a little at a loss as to how to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| because I'm not sure what the legal answer is yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Of course, if it takes a charter amendment, it'll have to wait until a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| If we don't have to do a charter amendment, we can do it much more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Would four weeks be sufficient time to do the research to come back with an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| I'm sure it would be, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Then I'd like to offer a substitute motion to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Mr. Gilbert or Mr. York, Mr. Cherry, Councilman Pilo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| what's a four-week difference going to make to you all while you're researching this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| You know, I don't think it will be a material difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| We want to try to get council happy on all this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| but I'll defer to my member on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Well, I think, you know, I just think I would say this has been a huge effort to make a very strong improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2197)|
| 0:36:49| in how we've been able to function over how we have functioned in the past months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| So I feel that we've made a very important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| And what I would say to you is the reason for bringing this before you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| and I don't love this word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| This is a word I'm going to use, but I don't care for the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I hear it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| But I think it's very important to have transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| I don't know another word to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| If I did, I sure as heck would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| But we want to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| We want you to be comfortable with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| So the only thing that concerns me is that it just seems that we still are not able to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| And personally, I would personally, having been in on, of course, all these discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2257)|
| 0:37:45| would prefer to approve this and then give us the opportunity to vet the wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| and the way in which we create this council or this outside group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| which we have not yet determined because for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| And Mr. Gilbert's advice is what we've been following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| So now that's the only comment I have to make, and it's not going to warp my world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| except that I do think I don't want to do anything that holds back the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| from being able to perform better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| I have a question for Mr. Gilbert, but first let me ask Mr. York whether he has any thoughts on this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| In terms of the delay, you know, two weeks, four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| there's some question of, you know, whether we can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| Clearly we can if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| There is one type of investment in terms of emerging markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| that we've been discussing for a lengthy period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| and we had hoped to basically pull the trigger on those types of investments here fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| And that's the only thing I think that's critical in terms of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| You know, I've had lengthy discussion with Council Member Roddy, and we discussed derivatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| I would think that, you know, if councils did decide to pass this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| that we could just basically agree that we will not invest in any derivative type investments until, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| we have a chance to come back with you on the investment council or whatever that term would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Yeah, let me ask Mr. Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| The question that Ms. Roddy asked about how long to postpone was sort of how long will it take to get the committee set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| And you said we have to research how long, whether it will take a charter change or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| I'm a little concerned because if it takes a charter change, you know, we don't need to postpone this because we're not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| I mean, I think this is something we need to do before the next general election and their challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| If it is a fairly simple thing, it seems like, you know, there's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Mr. Ehrich just laid out some of the challenges, but not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| And I guess I want to ask you is will it take you four weeks to figure out whether it's going to take a charter change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| Because I don't want to delay this longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| I guess if Ms. Roddy would consider it a two-week postponement as opposed to a four-week, so we can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| And I see a nodding head, and I guess if it's a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| if you're willing to change the motion to a two-week postponement as to a four-week postponement, I think I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Would someone – is that a motion to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I guess I will make a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| It's a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Let's take it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| To change it to two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| In a second, we'll accept the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Any other discussion on the – Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| You know, the other solution to this in terms of being –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| allowing the pension board to go forward with this revised policy is to revise the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| to pull out the things that are not comfortable without a secondary advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| and that way able to go forward with some pieces of the changes but not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| And that's certainly something that we can discuss in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| But I'm probably too – excuse me, but what were you going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Well, you could pull out the permission to use the derivatives and the swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| Actually, I would pull out the two investment items that are changes in this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| and I guess I would have to talk to Mr. York about what it is that he's hoping to pull the trigger on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| But as listed in the resolution, the first one is the investment of derivatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| including swaps, futures, and options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| And then the other one is this expands the investment authority, international equity classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| investments in non-U.S. corporations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| You could pull those things out and go forward with the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Well, Mr. Gilbert, you want to comment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Well, what we try to do in these investment policies is have broad authority to invest in the kind of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| that can earn a responsible but safe rate of return for our fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| The pension board never invests in any of these things without, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| the recommendation of its investment consultant, secondly, the recommendation of its legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| and then we hire a professional investment manager who is legally responsible for that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| So we have a lot of layers of protection that we place in our investment strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| And, you know, I'm sure we could take some of this flexibility out of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| and it wouldn't do any damage to the pension board because, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| we're not invested in some of those vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| But what we're trying to do is prepare ourselves to be able to do what we think we have to do to earn a decent rate of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| so that we can better manage this fund for the benefit of the city and the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| I'm not smart enough to tell you, you know, if you take out derivative investments, how badly that hurts us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| or whether that cripples us in a way that we can't earn 8% versus 7.75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| That's way above my pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| But we'll certainly look at it, Councilwoman, and try to be responsible in anything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Okay. The motion on the floor is to amend for two or, excuse me, to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Okay. I heard Pelo, Bailey, and Booker as noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| So I heard six ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| So the motion is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed to Bruce Goff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| for one parcel of property located at 459 Chickamauga Avenue within the city limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| presented to the Homemakers Program for a contract sales price of $30,101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you. I just wanted to make sure the applicant intends to live in this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| No, this is investment property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| I thought the Homemakers Program was limited to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| We were trying to sell houses to people who were going to reside in them themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| versus selling them to speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| No, that's not a requirement of the Homemaker Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| The goal is to get the property inhabited again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| This is a vacant property that's been on the chronic problem properties list since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| It's a property that's been a detriment, really, to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| You know, ideally you would have a, you know, owner-occupied situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| but we feel it's to have the house rehab is going to be renovated to our standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| or that we get the property back and there will be, you know, folks living in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| which will add to the value of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| The home is required to be rehabbed or, as I said, they have to, you know, we take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| So there are requirements to make sure that they're not just purchasing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| and then sitting on it, which has been the case with the property for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| So this could be like the rental rehab program then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| No, they get their own financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| They don't do the rental rehab through us, but basically, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| they would be rehabbing the program and then he would rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| So this is proposing to allow an investor to purchase the property and they can make it rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| Yes, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| And, again, it's something that's been vacant, blighted for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| and this will be a renovated home and there will be people living in it, which we believe will add value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| I understand, but just it's a homemaker's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| And, you know, somebody can start purchasing property, fixing it up and flipping it for a profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2756)|
| 0:46:06| when it's come to the city to be just the name of the program, the homemaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| So I have trouble supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| I heard Roddy, Frost, and Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| So I heard six ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Five ayes and four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Because it's close enough that I'll do a roll call vote if I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| I heard Frost, Roddy, Hall, and Holquist as no and the rest as ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| 11D is the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Rescinding Resolution Number R47707 and authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knox Area Rescue Ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| to provide $30,000 in community development block grant funding for renovations to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| located at 418 North Broadway in Knoxville to improve safety and to enhance the physical appearance of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2830)|

| 0:47:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Mr. King, the total contract price is for the sidewalk and the retaining wall or just the retaining wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| What is the total contract paying for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| The $128,000 is the total contract price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| The $12,000 is the change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| And then the $128,000 pays for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Construction of the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Sidewalk and retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I'm sure we weren't buying a $128,000 retaining wall for a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2891)|

| 0:48:37| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| At one point, Mr. King, the public service department was doing some of the alley paving, were they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| Actually, public service does the stone on the existing alley and the contract puts the asphalt on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=2934)|

| 0:50:18| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Is Ms. Wallace here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| At the workshop the other night, which was excellent, by the way, we talked about the funding for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| and I apologize for my confusion and didn't realize that the downtown streetscapes line item was the wayfinding item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| when we went through the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| So I understand that $300,000 has been allocated toward implementation of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| and I think there were some valid concerns raised during the workshop about ongoing maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| and there was a question to our consultant, and he quoted a figure of 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| but I didn't recall whether that was 10% of the capital investment as a set-aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| or I can't imagine it would be this much, 10% annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Do you recall what the estimate is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| To the best of my understanding, the consultant's estimate is 10% annually for maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| and replacement of any signs that get damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| The intent there is to make certain that the signs are getting washed annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| that they're being replaced whenever something's knocked over or vandalized beyond the point of repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| through general maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| And so they do estimate that number kind of on the high end, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| in order to make certain that the system is maintained well over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| I was hoping you were going to say 10% of the capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| So you're saying $300,000, $30,000 annually going forward for the life of the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| until they become obsolete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I think that's my understanding of what he has quoted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| And I would need to check with the consultant to confirm that, but that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Then I guess I would like to open up the floor for discussion with my fellow council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| in terms of what their concerns might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| You know, we had kind of floated the idea of a set-aside, you know, a holdback out of that $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| and I don't know whether council, I guess that gets into budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| I'm not sure we have the power to do anything but recommend that in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| But I do know there was concern going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I think it's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I endorse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| I loved what Merge presented the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| But I do think that considering ongoing maintenance is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| One of the suggestions and recommendations that has been made by the Steering Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| is that we work closely with the Central Business Improvement District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| to look at ways to share the costs both in terms of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| and also in terms of who provides the work for that maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| That is not something that has been detailed out at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| but we are certainly interested in working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| especially considering the annual revenue that they are able to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| and the ability that that would help to offset capital costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| But a definitive agreement has not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| I'll defer to my other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I guess I'm glad you clarified that issue, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| That was what I heard is this is an expensive ongoing maintenance prospect that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| And I think we've got to make the decision that it's worth it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| that downtown making the visit of people to downtown successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| and enjoyable and easy is a huge advantage to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| I like what you're hinting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| which is that we've got to figure out before we finish this project how we are going to maintain the signs long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| I don't know if I like the – I like exploring these ideas of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| well, we're going to see if somebody else can pay some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| But for the most part, some of us that somebody else is really just another pocket in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3231)|
| 0:53:59| And I love when we talk about getting KUB to fix a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| and it's sort of like, okay, that's coming from somebody else's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| But fundamentally, I think we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| We need to do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| And I think setting aside the money up front to make sure it's maintained well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| because these signs getting run down in five years looking bad, not having the correct directions on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| the correct information is worse than not doing the project at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| So I guess I will challenge the work you're doing, Ms. Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| to figure out a solid plan on how we get that $30,000, $40,000 a year to keep this system up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3270)|
| 0:54:40| Mr. Hoppus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Well, I think that it's worth it if we do it right, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| I think an argument can be made in the other direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| but my personal belief is that it's worth it if we do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| I think we've got a competent consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| as was pointed out by many of the comments that we received both during the workshop and after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| That said, some of those comments suggested some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| and I see in what we have before us option D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| and I'm going back to try to pull up the plan now because I didn't bring my hard copy with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| What was presented to us the other night was on page C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3321)|
| 0:55:32| that still shows having certain design characteristics, the dogwoods and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| and yet we're showing option D in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| And so we had several suggestions about mostly design particulars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| but that's what this is all about is design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| I mean, without the design component, there's nothing to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| And so I'm really curious as to how we're incorporating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| or are we going to acknowledge and try to incorporate those suggestions that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| All of the comments that were received have been forwarded on to MERGE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| I know there were also a few e-mails that came in to various council members after the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| and additional comments have also been forwarded on to MERGE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| And the intent and really the purpose of having this resolution before you this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| is to confirm that we are moving in the general correct direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| and that we will continue to tweak those details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| and if necessary we will have another public meeting or another public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| to make certain that those details are correct and that the folks generally support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| Obviously, design is a matter of taste and preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| and that gets to be very challenging when you have several different perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| but we have certainly heard the concerns regarding colors, regarding the pattern style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| and how intense that pattern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| and MERGE will be working on providing an additional format that updates that design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| which is why we put in the packet just a general design direction recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| as opposed to this specific design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| because we realize that we will still be tweaking colors and pattern as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Yes, and two particular concerns that we heard very clearly were how we deal with maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| and what to do about the city's logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| And I think the feedback we got both at the workshop and subsequently in e-mails from professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| that were very supportive of this program overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| but suggested that we have a unified map approach, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and B, that we do use the city's logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| I would hope that we would take those very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| We certainly are, and in fact, one of the contract discussions was that the city would provide the mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| that we would like to use for this project to the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| and that they would then incorporate it into the kiosks and various elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| So we can certainly investigate the appropriate mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| and making certain that we're using something that is kind of the one map concept that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| In terms of the city logo, there has been a real hesitancy on the part of our steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| and also on the part of folks who are design consultants to use the city logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| largely because we see that they have seen, working with several cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| that that does tend to change with administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| Whether we like that or not, the city is not a corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| and it's not selling its brand identity so strongly that we can't expect that there's a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3526)|
| 0:58:54| of a logo change at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| So there's a real hesitancy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Although one idea that has been discussed, Tommy Stokes did provide some additional information to me via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| One suggestion was using the typeface that is currently the typeface that we use for the city logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| and that's certainly something that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| It would be a simple change and it would still have some consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| without necessarily making it pinpointed to this specific logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| So we're investigating that and trying to have some good dialogue back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| and obviously that will be something for our steering committee to continue to weigh in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Ms. Walsh, I understand the funding that's in this year's budget is for Phase 1 of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Do you have a sense yet of how wide an area Phase 1 will be able to cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| What we've talked about at this point, Phase 1 would really focus on the number one issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| that came up in our public meetings, which is directing folks into the downtown core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| and providing them with directionals to the parking signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| and then from the parking that's available, both city garages and also the public parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| then getting them as a pedestrian out to the various destinations and then back into the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| So really the first phase focuses on parking and then pedestrian access throughout the downtown core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| So the full breadth of signage that we saw in the presentation that are in these books here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| for example, the designation of districts, Old North Knoxville or Old City Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| that probably is not part of Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Well, then I think Vice Mayor Becker stated it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| I think, you know, it's a great project going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| I would just challenge this committee, as they contemplate Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| to include in that funding request an adequate consideration of how maintenance is going to be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3629)|
| 1:00:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| And I guess my comments are rather personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| I expressed the other evening before I had to leave, and I regretted that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| my personal thinking about some of the design elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| But I'm pleased to hear you say that some consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| strong consideration is going to be made toward Mr. Stokes' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| because I received that e-mail and I thought that there was a lot of merit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| and opportunity to perhaps incorporate the logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| which, you know, I really had to agree with his assessment that just because Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3674)|
| 1:01:23| we changed mayors, doesn't mean that we change the embroidery on our shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| So, you know, I really like the new logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| It was hard to get used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| That has all happened since some of us came upon the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| But I really think it's very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| And I did speak to the fact that the city is so amazingly eclectic, and it's so charming because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| And so, consequently, I like the contemporary design of our logo now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| but I also like the fact that some of the historic elements will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| So I'm not going to have a voice long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| So I felt like I needed to get my comment in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| 11K is a resolution to extend the time period for the operation of the Tasman Pike Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| requested by Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Today I asked Mrs. Mitchell to pass out some information, in case people haven't seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| about very unfortunate news out of the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| which trickled down to the state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| which trickled down to governments throughout Tennessee and actually throughout the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| The federal government has basically taken back about $8.7 billion, with a B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3768)|
| 1:02:57| nationwide for road projects, and that includes about $190 million across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| I've been talking with Mr. King, and you all have in your packet tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| and you received an email today, a memo from Jeff Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| the Executive Director of the Transportation Planning Organization, how this is going to impact Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| It's going to prevent funding from going forward and prevent projects getting built citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| including Tazewell Pike and Beverly, any planned road construction out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| Thankfully, well, in the past we've used CMAQ funds to fund some greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Thankfully, now we don't have any trying to go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| But we don't know exactly what is going to be happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| We were in conversation with Mr. King last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| You know, this might get restored maybe a year later or maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| But nevertheless, I respectfully request the passage of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| This is just coming along at a most inopportune time that nobody could have ever predicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| It's going to affect projects out in Pleasant Ridge Road, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| and Mr. King mentioned some other ones, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Well, following up on what Councilman Frost said, yeah, it's a big deal, the rescission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| the $190 million rescissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| We actually took a double whammy, TDOT did and, well, all the states did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| but including the state of Tennessee and the recipients of the funds in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| because we took the $190 million rescission, which was a take back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| and then going forward because the big surface transportation bill has expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| we're on continuing resolutions to fund essentially Congress's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| I think right now it's just one month at a time, but they're funding as they funded before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| The only problem is it's minus the percentage that was taken back in the rescission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| So going forward, they're actually getting less money on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| in each one of these continuing resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| So that's where it's not just the $190 million, it's really a double whammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| So it's very, very painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Yeah, this is a very – I've actually served on this task force and been to some of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| and it actually is a very challenging issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| and I want to thank Mr. Frost for the leadership he's shown in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And I guess this is not – I don't want to amend anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| but I want to make a suggestion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| it says here that the council member representing the fourth district be the chair of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| and that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| But I'd like to suggest that the immediate past occupant of that council chair stay involved in the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| because he's been a real asset and has a lot of institutional knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| and might like to get out of it, but those of us – can he want to keep him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| Will I receive the same rate of pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| I might even double it for you, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| 12A is an ordinance enacted percent to TCA 675705| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| to implement a property tax freeze program for elderly low-income taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| Requested by Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Mr. York and I discussed this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| There are some administrative issues that would go along with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| but I think with about anything you do, there's administrative issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| Some people may not like this, which is fine, and I certainly respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| But, you know, this issue was put to vote, I believe, in a gubernatorial election and passed overwhelmingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=3999)|
| 1:06:49| You know, when something is put on the ballot, it's hard to ignore what folks say on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| So, you know, we've researched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| Thanks to Mrs. Mitchell making a lot of telephone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| Thanks to MTAS for working this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| I think we're at a point where we need to decide respectfully, one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| if we're going to go forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| This is not going to apply for this budget, but it might not apply the next few budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| But at some point, it was, like I said, voted upon and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| I guess I support passage of this when we feel like it's going to be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| And as Council Member Frost said, it will not be in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| and I'm hopeful that this provision will not be in the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| I do have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| I spoke to Mr. York, as well, about potential unknown implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| in terms of administrative costs of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| and I'd like to have a better sense of that so that those costs can be billed into a future budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| before we obligate ourselves to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| And I'm not talking about any lost revenue from freezing the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| I'm talking about the administrative part of certifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| Mr. York, would you like to speak to this at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| In terms of administrative costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| we've talked to a number of cities and counties that have implemented the property tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| Based on our estimate, we think that if Council were to implement this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| it would cost roughly $40,000 plus per year in administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| And there may be a little leeway in that, but hopefully we could bring it in for about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| In terms of other people, other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Montgomery County implemented this kind of ordinance and added two full-time positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| We've had estimates of $60,000 just in implementation costs from several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| We know that Sumner County, for example, administers it for five municipalities within Sumner County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4148)|
| 1:09:19| They levy a charge of $25 per applicant to each one of the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| Based on our numbers, we think they would be somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| So, again, if you use the $25 number, 2,000 would cost you $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| 3,000 would be, you know, more on the order of $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| Again, that's assuming roughly $25 per.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| No one has said that the administration of this ordinance is a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| In fact, I've heard a lot of different words describing the administration of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4190)|
| 1:09:59| Now, in terms of what the impact is, and this is the critical point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| if council were to adopt this ordinance prior to December 31st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| then this year, 2009, becomes the base year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| People would have to begin certifying immediately in early 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| That's where your administration cost comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| If there is a tax increase next year, then their taxes would be frozen at the 2009 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4226)|
| 1:10:35| If there is no tax increase next year, then basically you've gone through the administrative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| and it will still be a moot point, but you will have invested, again, roughly $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| Now, again, the key is the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| So it's kind of a question to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| If you believe, if you support this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| and you do, in fact, believe that there will be a tax increase next year, then you should probably adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| If you believe that there will not be a tax increase next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| then it could be adopted any time in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| You know, you start the clock whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| It's just a question of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| But whenever you start the clock, the administrative costs start escalating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| And, Mr. York, to clarify, those administrative costs are not one-time costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| Those administrative, you have to, an individual has to recertify every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| Now, they can, we have people come on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| For some reason, you know, some people will not be eligible this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| but they may be eligible two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| And then some people that are eligible now may not be eligible two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| So the $40,000 to $60,000 figure that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| That's an annual recurring cost every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| I think Mr. Hulkless was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Mr. York, while you're at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| I had some time, months and months ago, I had sent some information, shared it with council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| just I think it was an article out of Governing Magazine, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| sort of talking about unintended consequences of these kinds of laws and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| where they freeze property taxes for a segment of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| Essentially, if I remember correctly, it's been a while since I read that article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| but if I remember correctly, it said what happens is it creates an incredible disincentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| for those property owners to either sell their property and move because then when they move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| they've lost their frozen property tax status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| or to improve their properties because that changes the tax appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| and the assessment of the property and they lose the frozen status then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| Is that your understanding of what happens and what would happen with this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| The classic case, I think, is Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| And Florida had lots of something called Save Our Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| Now, you did have people that were, in essence, tied to their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| They can neither upsize nor downsize because their taxes would jump dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| And, again, a lot of people, you know, viewed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| They couldn't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| My reading of this ordinance is that if someone were to move, they could still recertify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| but they would recertify at the taxes on the new resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| and they couldn't hold whatever their taxes are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| They're not portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| So, if you do any moving, then basically the taxes change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| Conversely, if you do any improvement, any major improvements to the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| you can freeze the portion on the existing piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| but you would pay the full taxes on the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| Again, that's part of the administrative hassle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Now, again, whether that will in turn, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| force some people into either moving or not moving, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| I would think that, you know, again, taxes in Florida are a lot higher than they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| So, you might not make a decision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| Whereas, in Florida, you could have six to $10,000 increases in taxes just by moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| So, significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| And, again, you could downsize in Florida and still see a $6,000 to $10,000 increase in your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| Well, I do have a copy of that article in my possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| It was done by Otis White, dated February of – well, it was – the date I have on it is February of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4478)|
| 1:14:46| But he uses the term dumb-dumb laws describing efforts to reform property taxes in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4486)|
| 1:14:55| And he's very blunt and very critical and says that it creates massive unintended consequences along the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| we were just talking about where people are afraid to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| and they're afraid to do anything to their homes for fear that it will change their tax status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| And, therefore, you get significant decline in properties owned by people that are subject to this tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4514)|
| 1:15:24| So, that's what worries me is the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| I think, in concept, it sounds like a wonderful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| But, in reality, what are the unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| And that's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| I guess this is kind of a challenging one because I'd actually not thought about the administrative costs until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| And I'm glad I got to speak to Mr. York and have that come in because it does put us in a challenging position politically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| and fiscally of how we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| I like the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I think to say to seniors below a certain income level, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| if the value of your house goes up, you're going to get a tax increase is not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| So, I like the concept behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| There's some real challenges in how we implement it because, at some level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| if we put this in and we go five, six, eight years without a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| we're running up some pretty hefty administrative costs for no goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| I also know that the tendency, the politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| and the structure of how property taxes work for local government means you stretch as long as you possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| without a tax increase and you put a big hunking increase in then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| And then you go as long as you can without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| And the key is to get the tax freeze that year and to be signed up on it that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| I also know that we're not doing a big tax increase next year or even a little one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| The politics means we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| By the same token, the politics also work out that I know who the members of city council are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| and I don't know who they're going to be next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| So, this is a challenging one and it feels like the debate is do we pass this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| or do we wait a year and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| And I'm not going to make a motion yet because I still want to hear what other people have to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| I'm sorry, Mr. Bailey, and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Excuse me, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| I remember in 2007 when this passed, you know, it was a relatively hot topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| and I felt like at the time it was something that probably we would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| But as we began to discuss the pros and cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| even to those who thought that this might be a benefit to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| until you get into some of the things Councilman Hulk was just talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| you know, an intelligent voter or what have you might not support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| It might not help those who thought it might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| And I felt like from that point on that until it looked like we had a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| where then we could go through and analyze the administrative costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| and how many people would be affected by it and who it would benefit or not benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4679)|
| 1:18:07| the prudent thing would be just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| and I know it's been brought forward on numerous occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| and has either been postponed or withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| So I think that where I stand is that until we have a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| and we can really analyze the benefits, the pros and cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| that it's just not the right time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Now, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| As this Council is aware, both the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| and City Council can change the tax rate up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| Mr. York, sorry, would this assist you at all if the effective date of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| wasn't until, say, January 2nd of next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Would that be of assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Well, again, you defer the cost probably for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Again, I'd have to check, but I think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| If you were to adopt it on January 1st, then, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| it really doesn't make any difference in terms of the base year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| whether you adopt it on January 1st or December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| You know, this has been brought up before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| and it was brought to my attention by some senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| who lived in Fountain City who saw that it was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| and thought that this would apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| They every so often check in to see if it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| You know, you can always try to second-guess the will of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| That's, you know, similar to the issue we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| whether or not you can have firearms in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| Certain things have been left to local legislative bodies to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| and, you know, this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| Mr. Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Actually, let me go to Ms. Pillow and then I'll go to Mr. Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| Well, I don't have a great deal to say on this subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| because I have appreciated very much the information that's been passed along to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| and the opportunity to hear the discussion tonight, and that has been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| This is not a pretty subject for any of us to have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| And while I have had a couple of people come to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| I think they're people who this would not apply to, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| but who have been watching the temperature on this issue, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| They have been very understanding at the prudency of the council in terms of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| or not this is a prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| You know, somebody mentioned, is it a political thing or is it a physical thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Well, with me personally, it's a physical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| And I just feel of all times that we would add any kind of burden or uncertainty to our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4856)|
| 1:21:08| because I think the budget that's going to be before some of you next year is going to be a very difficult decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4868)|
| 1:21:18| on its own without adding any other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| And so I would just say that as much as I would like this to be a good idea, in my assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4882)|
| 1:21:34| I just cannot come down on the side of this being a good idea at this particular time, simply can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4894)|
| 1:21:42| And with me, I just have tried very hard for this not to be political decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| but for the decisions I make to be more in terms of being responsible and accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| And I think in my thinking, I would not be responsible at this point in time to vote in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4915)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Just a couple of things I'll quote from this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| One, he says, concerning these laws and ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| they actually punish homeowners who improve their property and cement others into their houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| often to their neighborhood's detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| And he quotes from a Tampa Tribune article that describes one street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| where one elderly couple tore down their house and built a new house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| and their tax bill went from $3,275 a year to $14,821.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4951)|
| 1:22:40| The lady down the street, 72-year-old widow, her tax bill is $1,098 a year and will stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| Her daughter wanted her to move into a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| She couldn't do it because her taxes would go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| She was locked into that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| So, if anyone thinks that there won't be unintended consequences to an action like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| I think you need to think again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I can't support it at this point for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Go ahead and ask Ms. Mitchell to do a roll call on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| I heard three ayes and six noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| 12B is an ordinance to amend Article V Sections 10E1E4, 10E2A4B, and 10G5A4B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5014)|
| 1:23:46| so as to reduce the minimum street frontage requirement for electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| used as changeable price signs from 250 feet to 100 feet requested by Councilmember Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| Before we start the discussion, we do have several people signed up to speak as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| as our upgrade for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| Our Maxine wants to add something she wants to start off the discussion with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| I understand that we need a motion to amend the language of the caption of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| to make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| If you look at Line 7, which refers to Section 10G5A4B, we need to add in the language of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| the zoning ordinance to make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| I'm not sure I follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| You might try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| I'm not sure I follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Or help me understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| If you look at Line 7 of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| You can refer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| It refers to Section 10G5A4B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| Mr. Swanson has suggested that we add in the language of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| following that section number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| Before so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Before the word so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| To make it clear which sections those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Do I need a motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Well, right now there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| What I would suggest is let's wait until there is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| At that point in time, we will make a motion to amend if and when someone wants to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Legal counsel, we can't really adopt this, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Because this hasn't been MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| But, yeah, I think the amendment needs to be made before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| If we're going to send it to MPC, that amendment needs to be made, I think, is a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| Am I right, Maxine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| So, basically, we have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| First is to send it to MPC or, second, it fails here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| And, Maxine or Debbie, if you'd correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| We do have three folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| In favor is Mike Hamill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| If you'd come down and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| Mike Hamill with Pilot 5508 Lowness Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| I appreciate the council members bringing this up before the council to reduce the street frontage from 250 to 100 linear feet of street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5182)|
| 1:26:35| As has been discussed in numerous meetings, there is no question that electronic message centers are a safe and effective medium to communicate with drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5195)|
| 1:26:51| In fact, that's why Department of Transportation all across the country use electronic message centers to communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5211)|
| 1:26:59| whether that's for an automated traffic management system or for safety during construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| In fact, in 1980, the Federal Highway Administration commissioned a report, a study, to prove that electronic message centers were detrimental to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5227)|
| 1:27:22| In fact, that failed, and they found just the opposite, that it was more safe with these because they're more legible to the drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5242)|
| 1:27:31| The point of Pilot, obviously, is that we're a convenience store operator that sells gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| And, in particular, this amendment is directed toward sole use electronic message centers or electronic pricers, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5257)|
| 1:27:48| The point being is that few, if any, convenience stores or gas stations require 150 feet in order to effectively operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5268)|
| 1:28:00| But the ordinance, as written, that requires the 250 feet of linear footage effectively denies service station owners and operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5280)|
| 1:28:10| convenience store owners and operators, the benefit of this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Signed up to speak against the ordinance are Joyce Feld and Melissa McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5301)|
| 1:28:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| And I'm here representing Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| And we all thought we were done with this issue, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| Scenic Knoxville is opposed to reducing the frontage requirements for changeable price signs from 250 feet to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5331)|
| 1:29:00| As you well know, there were lengthy discussions over the course of several months before the current ordinance was adopted in March of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5340)|
| 1:29:10| Scenic Knoxville's willingness to support the 250 foot frontage requirement for changeable price signs was a compromise position to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5350)|
| 1:29:20| The alternative position for us was a ban on all digital signs, including changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| The same arguments that applied then apply now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| While convenient for the owners, these signs are still a form of visual blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| and the city should not change the current ordinance to allow a greater number than it does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| More and more communities are banning digital signs, and these bans include all changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| Businesses similar to those that have requested a reduction in frontage are operating without issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| and without changeable price signs in cities across the country and next door in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| I didn't prepare any information on safety statistics, but I'm somewhat taken aback by the statistics that were quoted by the gentleman who just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5404)|
| 1:30:17| I'm not aware of any studies that have any methodologically sound studies that have shown that there's no hazard to drivers from electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5417)|
| 1:30:30| and, in fact, there are new studies coming out which show that there are safety hazards for drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5430)|
| 1:30:38| In addition, compounding the problem, I think there are still enforcement problems with the brightness standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| Although city council, city zoning officials, and MPC worked hard to come up with an enforceable definition of brightness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| I'm not sure anyone really knows what the specified standards are supposed to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| and it's clear to me that in spite of a requirement that every sign is to have an automatic dimming sensor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| brightness levels are not changing based on ambient illumination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| The result is extremely bright EMCs and changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| When it's overcast and at night, and some continue to be extremely bright even in full sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| Rather than weakening the current ordinance, I would urge council to look into this issue and to ensure the law is fully complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| The current ordinance has only been in effect for seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| It was not passed hastily nor without extensive thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| It was passed after considerable public input and public support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| It should not be amended because a few businesses are requesting that it be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| And I think besides Mrs. McAdams and myself, we have some other folks who also are opposed to this amendment, if they could raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5507)|
| 1:31:56| Stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Melissa McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5522)|
| 1:32:12| Melissa McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| With this proposal, City Council is revisiting an issue that was recently well aired and settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| I'm opposed to this proposed zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| As Joyce pointed out, based on concerns about public safety, scenic beauty, and environmental impact, you recently enacted uniform standards for EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5545)|
| 1:32:38| I won't rehash a lot of what we've been through, but I want to make a few points that are kind of new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| One, recent news about the dangers of texting while driving underscores the need to control EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| If looking at a screen in your hand causes unsafe driving, then looking at a screen at the side of the road undoubtedly causes the same unsafe driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5570)|
| 1:33:01| Your attention has been diverted from the task at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| The conclusion of the recent study was that texting is more dangerous than driving under the influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| Two, these signs constitute more than just visual distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| Their bright lights and prominence dominate our valleys and hilltops along major arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| Neighbors, both residential and commercial, are impacted and made lesser by comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| Three, I also think technology has already made these signs unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| Just as people can get directions from the Internet, so they can now get prices on their cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5614)|
| 1:33:41| I hope you'll read this ordinance carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| The second provision, the whereas, city council is of the opinion that in the current economic climate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5624)|
| 1:33:52| wherever possible, the city council should reduce or eliminate onerous or unreasonable limitations on businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| who choose to do business within the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| unless the city would be substantially harmed by reducing or eliminating such restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| Is this the correct standard to govern by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| No restrictions on commercial enterprise unless there is substantial harm to the public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5652)|
| 1:34:19| Is mere harm not enough to limit the profit motive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| Contrary to the language used in the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| the frontage requirement is not overly restricted or an unreasonable obstacle to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| Before this agreement was made, I believe we had a 200-foot frontage requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| and suddenly it seems necessary to go to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| I think 250 feet, the compromise, was a good one, and I hope you'll stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Mr. Hamill, if you'd like, by rules, you have a chance to make any rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| You don't have to, but if you would like to, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| I'll hustle down then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| One thing that I would like to point out is, just as perhaps a case study, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| I recently, or a pilot recently, rebuilt our location on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| Currently, Cumberland Avenue, and this is off the top of my head, but these are round figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| currently Cumberland Avenue has approximately 550 square feet of legally nonconforming signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5725)|
| 1:35:34| In working closely with several city departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| we were asked to see what we could do as far as reducing some of that signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| and we were able to do that to about 175 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| We've gone through the variance process and have received variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| Unfortunately, again, because we consider electronic message centers that are pricers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| as an electronic message center overall, rather than a sole use sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5759)|
| 1:36:06| it requires that we would have to take down our reader board, and we're not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| But my point is that because electronic message centers in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| specifically the sole use signs, whether it's a time temperature, open, closed, whatever it is, are more legible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5778)|
| 1:36:27| They can be reduced in size, and that's exactly what we were planning to do there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| because the technology allows a driver, which is exactly why the DOT uses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| It allows a driver to more legibly read a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Mr. Becker, I'm going to ask you to lead this discussion, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Thanks for the heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And then I see Mr. Hall's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Actually, it's easier to do from up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| You know, we just, like it was previously alluded to, we've discussed this very topic for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| Like several years, to be honest, with workshops and workshops and more workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| Every meeting considered, as I call DMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| And actually, even though this passed just about seven months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| I believe part of this very ordinance hadn't been enforced until the past two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| I think it's, I mean, this is basically asking for a reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| That's the de facto request before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| I think it's a little premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| I think you need to have something under your belt, so to speak, and experience, see the pros, see the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5867)|
| 1:37:55| And I would respectfully submit that enough time has not passed in order for this council to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5875)|
| 1:38:04| Point of clarification on TDOT using these signs for road construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| Those are, as far as I've ever seen, those are temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Those are uses that are there for a project in particular or for warning about traffic issues ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5896)|
| 1:38:25| They're not in use 24 hours a day, seven days a week, advertising something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5905)|
| 1:38:34| I respectfully submit that I cannot support this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| I'm going to call on Mr. Hall and Ms. Rodney and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| and I'm going to point out we do not have a motion on the floor at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Well, you know, not to counteract Councilman Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| but I do think that TDOT does have some of these signs that are up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| I know they're on Woodland, not on Woodland, but on the stretch of 275 between Woodland and Haskell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5941)|
| 1:39:11| There's a sign there that will tell you it will take you so long to get to such and such an exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| And I personally think that's a permanent type sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| You know, it may not have a message on there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| I go by there half a dozen times every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And whether I've, you know, consciously looked at the sign, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| But getting back to the EMCs and these changeable price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| this is not a sign that's going to be changed every two or three minutes or every five or ten minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| or I don't suspect that they'll be changing gasoline prices that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| It would be nice if they were going down that fast, but I don't really anticipate that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| But, you know, these are signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| And I remember these discussions well that we had about the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| And it was really, to the best of my recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| we were deep into the electronic message centers before any of us really realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| that these signs at gas stations were included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| And I personally think that when you start talking about texting versus looking at a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| that to me is not even talking in the same spectrum of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| Texting is you're down here looking at this, looking at signs that aren't changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| Now, I'm not going to say that you won't drive by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| and some gas station may not be changing the price at the moment you're going by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| but it's not something to where they're changing them constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| You know, we were talking about these electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| These were signs that people were putting up and we were requiring them to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| there was discussions about how long the message would actually stay there before it changed and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| And we're talking about hamburgers and French fries and Cokes or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| and then them changing that with some type of frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| These signs are not changed that often has been my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| And there has been several businesses that have e-mailed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| and contacted me about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| And I take it that most of these people sent the same e-mails and letters to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| And there are gas stations and convenience stores throughout this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| that do not have 250 feet of road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| And I think by what we have passed, we have singled out a certain group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| just because their business is not this big or doesn't take up this much space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| and are really confining them to the type of signage that they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| I concur with Council Member Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| I do recall that the issue of the changeable price signs for gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| and I believe we were also told hotels use these, came up late in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| And I feel like it was an oversight on our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| to sweep the changeable price signs in with the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| In my mind, what we were trying to limit by looking at the street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| and requiring the 250 feet of minimum street frontage was for the electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| that we think of at restaurants or banks or whatever, advertising what's on special that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6146)|
| 1:42:33| or a congratulatory message or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Whereas the changeable price signs are, as Mr. Hall said, they're not changing frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| I believe that the restrictions on flashing would stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| It's just a solid dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| And I think it's the reality that a business of this nature, whether it's a hotel or a gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| or anyone that uses a changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| has the necessity in their business to advertise the price that they are competitively offering their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| I think this ordinance that Mr. Hall has presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| specifically calls out changeable price sign in every single paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| except for the one that Mrs. McAdams took issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| And I agree with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| I think that that language is overly broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| We talked earlier this evening during beer board about our concern about setting a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| an unintended precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| And if we get to such a point as putting a motion to the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| I would support amending the resolution to delete that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| I don't think it's substantive in what this ordinance is trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| And it eliminates the possibility of setting a precedent on that broad economic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6215)|
| 1:43:43| I'm next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| I'm going to say I know I gave this speech while we were debating all the EMC stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| I think that a lot of us felt like we solved something when we voted on that finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| I don't think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| I think we sort of got to a point where we finally just had to give up and decide on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| But I don't think piecemeal changes like this are what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| I suggested in a resolution a task force looking at all the options of how technology can help us reduce sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| I think this is part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| But it's a much bigger question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| There are questions about whether a price changer sign is better than the message boards with the pasted up letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| Questions about whether a higher sign with a smaller face is a better sign than a low sign with a big face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| A lot of questions that go with this that I think we need to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| I'm inclined to put a motion on to untable my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| But what we actually had said when we tabled it is we were going to ask the administration to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| And I'm going to challenge them to say this isn't going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| And I don't think it's going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| So we need to pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| And I guess I will, again, remind folks we do not have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| And go to Mr. Frost, then Mr. Booker, and then Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| I mean, you know, everybody thinks it's gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| But the way the ordinance is written, you could advertise blue jeans, moon pies, soft drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6308)|
| 1:45:16| Then all of a sudden, if you're allowing it for every 100-foot piece of property with 100 feet of frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| then all of a sudden you've created EMCs with every single business that has something to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| that they can make it look like, you know, it can comply with what is intended for gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| but it can apply for other goods or services that they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| So while everybody is focusing in on changeable price signs for a gas issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| I think if you consider the ordinance as a whole, you start to allow these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| Then if you have 100 feet or more of frontage, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| a lawyer can run a special for a will for $150 or, you know, Joe Bailey goes into the clothing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| and he can put pants on sale and one day he's advertising a good deal on pants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| and the next day he's advertising a good deal on blazers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| So, you know, be careful what you ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| Mr. Booker and then Ms. Rowdy and Ms. Pilo and Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| The last time we had an ordinance of this nature to limit advertising, I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6385)|
| 1:46:35| This time I'd like to make a motion that we approve this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| I want to vote for it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Ms. Rowdy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Yes, I saw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| Ms. Rowdy, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Ms. Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| Is that all you wish to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Speak now or forever hold your peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Well, I was just going to concur with some comments that have already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| This is, you know, it's a very difficult subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| and one that we've really worn out with each other and I think with everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6425)|
| 1:47:14| However, I have to agree that this came up very late, very late in the discussion about MCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6434)|
| 1:47:23| and I feel badly that we were not able to perhaps place it within the decisions that we made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6443)|
| 1:47:33| Seven months ago, somebody tells me it seems like yesterday, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| So I am very concerned about the fact that some locations do have much more frontage than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6458)|
| 1:47:51| I think it really does place an unfair disadvantage on those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| and perhaps those businesses, had there been something in place for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| would have made a decision not to build out to the extent they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| because it would have cost them the opportunity to competitively advertise their prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| And it's strange how we all have different perceptions and they will tell you perceptions everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| and I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| But now I have to agree with the comments about texting because I don't see that in the same light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| just because of the way in which I have to text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| But I will say this, and I know many of you that I know and love will disagree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6514)|
| 1:48:42| but it is so much safer to have a price sign when I'm looking to buy gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| I really do pay attention to the price of gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| I think we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| And I think it's very important when people are traveling along a very busy roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| that they are able to safely determine where they're going to pull off and purchase gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| And so, here again, perception is everything, but that's my perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| and I just have to go with my sense of what's wise and what isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| So, I'm prepared to support this and then send it along to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| And if there's some, I guess I have one question for our attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| It's been pointed out that we can sell blue jeans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| I was thinking about filling teeth or extracting teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| We all have different little personal pet things we, you know, need to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| But, Councilman, you can't put those signs out in the town of Farriot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| Well, I do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| There are many other things you can't do there either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Let's not talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| And, like, when you talk about teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| if you put a sign out that says $125 in front of a dental office or a legal, a law office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| what does that get you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| Because it doesn't, we're not putting on there what you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| No, we're putting on there what a gallon of gas is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| And in a motel room, it's the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Oh, well, don't even go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Councilman Frost referred to that you could be selling clothes or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| but the sign didn't say what you're selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| If you're an attorney, for an example, putting $175 out there don't really tell you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| I'd have to play chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| You didn't get caught on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| This pillow still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| I don't know where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| As punishment, he's got to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| I'm just so delighted to hear Mr. Hall speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| I was kind of shocked myself, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| I was perfectly happy for him to take the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| Thank you, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| But, no, I wanted to comment in regard, and maybe you've made the point without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| the attorney making the point, Mr. Hall, I can't believe that, that it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| mention what you're selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| I'll just save my question for, forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| Before I go to Mr. Bailey, parliamentary question about the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| Because a motion to approve actually isn't legal, and I don't know whether the proper answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| and I'm looking to people on my right or left who are the experts on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| is a motion to refer back or an amendment to the motion to refer back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| I need some clarity on what we actually, because we can't actually approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| It needs to go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| But we wanted to amend it before we referred it, which is where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Yeah, it needs to be amended, for one thing, for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| The paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| In the paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| And if it was considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Which it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| Now, whether the distance part was considered, I don't know at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| But, you know, it has been considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| But this is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| and proposed amendments have to go through the same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| that the initial passage of the ordinance did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| So it does need to go through the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| So the proper motion would be to refer this to MPC after the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| After the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| So we're on a point where we have a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| there's going to be a motion to amend, and then a motion to refer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| And we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Let me go to Mr. Bailey next, and then Mr. Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| and then Mr. Paul, who finished, and I guess Ms. Roddy then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I'm not sure my comments are appropriate towards the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| So I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| You can stop me if they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| I don't know if I would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Because I had a couple of questions, and I guess that might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| And I know Ms. Cash isn't here, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Who in her place could I ask a couple of questions to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| You know, you got tired and just voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| We had a good dialogue and a good discussion, and we came to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Having said that, we were really talking about, and I voted to ban the EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| and I know we talked about these changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| But in my mind, you have the businesses that exist there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| who have invested in these signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| and I'm wondering what we could do in terms of existing signs versus new signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6802)|
| 1:53:32| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| I believe existing signs are covered by the operational characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| and Ms. Poplin, fill me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| The operational characteristics apply to existing signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| but if there's a sign that has less than 250 feet, it can continue to operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| So the ones that don't have it need to come down, or we're going to start enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| The ones that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| That are in violation, that are less than 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| More than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| More than 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| Well, I don't even want to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| because I think we're going to have quite a while to go before it goes to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| and come back, but I think there's some solutions to this that we could talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| and it's sort of along the same lines that we came to the earlier conclusion in vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| So I'm just going to stop there and wait on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| Well, I find myself agreeing with some of the comments of our Vice Mayor and Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6871)|
| 1:54:41| It's true that you wouldn't be advertising the item itself with a pricing sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| but that's not the way pricing signs work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| There's usually a fixed sign that advertises whatever commodity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| or item has been priced, and the changeable part is the price itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| So it could be used for other things, and it probably would not be used for blue jeans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| but I wouldn't guarantee that that wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| But I'll be willing to bet that there are things that none of us in this dais have thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| that people would use to price, and probably quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| So I think the argument that it only will cover fuel is probably not necessarily an accurate argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6923)|
| 1:55:32| and I tend to find myself in this instance in pretty much complete agreement with our Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| that this is a piecemeal approach, and I do not think this is the way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| I think there are a lot of issues that need to be tackled, and there's a better way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| So it's on that basis that I have great difficulty seeing why I should support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| not that I'm totally unsympathetic with the argument in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| but I'm not convinced that this is the way to go about addressing the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| With the permission of the Chair, I would like to make three, and for the sake of clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| I'd like to make three separate ordinances, or three separate, I can't even talk, I'm so tired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| three separate amendments, and we'll see if they are seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| The first amendment is to clarify the language in the caption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| and that is what our council mentioned earlier, and that is to insert the phrase of the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| The second motion is to, can I go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| The second amendment is to amend this ordinance to delete paragraph three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| which is the whereas at the top of page two, the reference to current economic climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| And the third amendment is to, or the third motion is to refer this entire package, as amended or not, to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7015)|
| 1:57:07| We have to take them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Oh, is there a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| We have to take them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| So first amendment is to change the caption to add the words of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7033)|
| 1:57:21| after the letter B there on that line, after it lists all the letters and numbers, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| Is there discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| Let me do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| Amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| The second one is to delete the third whereas paragraph at the top of the second page on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7057)|
| 1:57:48| Question, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| Who drafted the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Mr. Swanson actually drafted the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| I told him what I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| I didn't tell him to put in all the whereases and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| He does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7082)|
| 1:58:10| Well, then Amateur didn't put it in there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Other discussion on the amendment to delete the paragraph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| All those in favor of the amendment, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| The amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| Yes, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| One vote against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| And then the third one is to refer to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| If not, I'm going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| Again, I believe we should not be dealing with this piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| I don't want to refer this because I think we need a more comprehensive solution to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| So I'm going to be voting no on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| We'll do a voice vote and see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| All those in favor of the amendment, which is to refer this to MPC, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| May I ask Madam Recorder to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| The motion passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| This is referred to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7175)|
| 1:59:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I think that takes us on our agenda to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| We do have three folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| First is Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Kevin, what's the appropriate way to pass out something to councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| Maybe just bring it up here to Mr. Bailey and then we'll pass it around the circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7214)|
| 2:00:21| Originally, I came here tonight to speak against a rezoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| Now that's withdrawn, it's actually an interesting segue because the question is, in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| that Mr. Durnagan owns out on Washington Pike, what is going to happen next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| Is there anything that we can do to try and get in front of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| We've had a lot of discussions with Mr. Durnagan and the Aliceville Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| NECPA, some of the other neighbors in the last few weeks or months about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7245)|
| 2:00:53| One thing that we've uncovered is that a lot of this property is now subject essentially to loss of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| It's in foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| The developer no longer has a say in what can be done on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| The banks are calling some of the shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| As a quick, brief history, I think most of you have seen my letter, but a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| this was all low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| The developer started acquiring land out there and has now presented the neighborhood with an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7275)|
| 2:01:25| They said, okay, well, we like this concept and we'll go ahead and allow you to rezone that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| There were some great ideas in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| He did listen to the residents, but as the life cycle of this development has gone on, plans have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| What was supposed to be a bank was a proposed car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| A restaurant turned into a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| At this point now, we're left with, well, what's actually going to happen out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| This development is in the middle of a lot of residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| It also borders some agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| It borders a historic farm that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| There are some sensitive boundaries out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Actually, this development and this area, it's a boundary area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| There's a boundary between two county commission districts out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| There's a boundary between the north city sector plan and the northeast county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| There's a very hard boundary between the urban growth boundary for the city and rural growth for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| I'm sorry, rural area for the county, and there's not a planned growth transition area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| It's a boundary area, and it might actually require a little bit more control than what is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7348)|
| 2:02:35| I've talked a lot to Northeast Knox Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| I've talked with Alice Fell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| I've talked with the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| I've even talked with my family members, and we've got a proposal idea that might make a little bit of sense out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7363)|
| 2:02:51| Right now, the current existing zoning is there's a hodgepodge of shopping center, office, commercial one, and commercial three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| And the idea that we've socialized that we think is worthy of some discussion is to actually bring this to a planned commercial one zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7379)|
| 2:03:08| And this would be something that city council would actually look at rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| We did talk to the developer about if he would be willing to put some restricted covenants on the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| or if he'd be willing to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| He indicated that he really was not in a place in control of the land to do this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| Planned commercial brings a benefit of that is it brings use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| so it requires the developer to submit the uses on a plan to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| That gives neighborhood an opportunity to actually provide feedback and comments on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| Another thing that can be done is we can put some performance standards into place that deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| that help these couple of sensitive boundaries like lighting, signage, noise, and operating areas or operating hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7425)|
| 2:03:53| So this is a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| It's a discussion idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| It's a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| There's definitely some work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| I do know Mr. Donaldson and I, we've talked a little bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| and we think this might be a way to get a little bit of control out there when the situation that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| again, talking to the developer, it looks like a lot of this property is an imminent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| very soon going to be sold by banks or offers on parcels out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| and it's about to be developed in a pretty uncontrolled manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| There's no restrictions on design, on lighting, on anything like that beyond the standard zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7466)|
| 2:04:33| So with that, I'd just like to thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| Let me ask Mr. Donaldson a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Come on up, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| But, Mark, I think Rob has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| I've had the pleasure two, maybe three weeks ago, visiting with Mr. Murphy out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| Mr. Donaldson, this is a project that MPC would like to take upon itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| Well, we think the idea of unifying the zone districts for those parcels that are within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7496)|
| 2:05:04| makes a whole lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| and we like the idea of utilizing a zone district that requires the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| with development plan approval in order to consider all of those parcels collectively when we do analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7511)|
| 2:05:20| Otherwise, they can be developed piecemeal under the C3, C4, O1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7520)|
| 2:05:28| and you literally do lose some control over what can happen with particular sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7528)|
| 2:05:36| So in terms of direction, MPC would prefer a resolution from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| It would be great to have that indication from you on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| so that we know that there's some expectation of approval if it gets back to you, when it gets back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| Lisa, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| My name is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| I live at 6233 Baberly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| I've been the president of NEPCA for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| and we were the neighborhood group that primarily worked with Victor Jernigan years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| to change this residential zoning into commercial zoning, to a neighborhood commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7571)|
| 2:06:18| And the reason that we supported that at the time is because it was part of his overall concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| for a walkable mixed-use community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| and he had a vision for how multiple kinds of housing and neighborhood commercial would all come together in a sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7587)|
| 2:06:37| walkable way, and we bought into that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| And so over the years, we have supported Victor in his many rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| and things that have happened at Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| One of the ideas or one of the things that was going to happen in Victor's mind was a connector road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7612)|
| 2:07:01| that would connect Murphy Road to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| And so we felt, because of that gateway, that boundary kind of thing that Kevin was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7625)|
| 2:07:13| that this might be an appropriate area at some point in the future with infrastructure improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| specifically road improvements, that it would be a worthwhile thing to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| And fortunately, things have changed, and this concept is not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| The Murphy Road extension will probably never happen, or it's years and years in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7649)|
| 2:07:37| and there are no road improvements planned for Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| Unfortunately, all of these commercial properties now are zoned, and Mr. Jernigan does not have control over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7662)|
| 2:07:52| Without the road improvements, I am very concerned that what we're looking at, if we just let them develop anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| whoever the highest bidder is gets to take these properties and develop them without any design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7679)|
| 2:08:07| without any use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| And, you know, the arrangement that we, the agreement that we had with Victor is that some of these developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| would not happen until the road improvements were in place, because we're talking about two-lane Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| which basically is the corridor for all the neighborhoods and all the subdivisions that are in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| You've got the sheriff's department and the city police going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| and forth to the detention center on two-lane Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| and you have all the commuters from Union County going down that same road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| And so now we're talking about a situation where we've got all this commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| that could potentially happen right there at that intersection with no control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| And so I'm asking you to please consider rezoning to plan commercial this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7732)|
| 2:09:01| doing a corridor study, putting a moratorium on building permits until we get a handle on what's going to happen out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7741)|
| 2:09:09| and or, you know, a small area study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| We need something so that we can be assured that we're not going to be sitting in total and complete gridlock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7753)|
| 2:09:22| and unable to go anywhere on Washington Pike because of all of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| properties that's zoned for development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Ladies and gentlemen of council, thank you so much for your patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| and I know you're all tired and I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| They pretty much said what I would have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| The bottom line is there's about 150 acres of commercial office and mixed zoning out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7786)|
| 2:09:53| more than 20 parcels, and Victor Jernigan has lost control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| Now, he had, I believe, the man when he tells us he had good faith in what he was going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| and he sold the community on a wonderful concept, something that would have been like nothing else in Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7803)|
| 2:10:10| But he told me a week ago in a meeting with some other folks that could he not get this last parcel that he currently controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7810)|
| 2:10:21| that he was out, he's done, he has no control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| And what we're all, all of us, everybody in this room, taxpayers and citizens of Noss County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| are about to have happen is that there's going to be somebody come in and deal with these bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7831)|
| 2:10:37| These bankers have no interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| By the way, these bankers, these are banks that I never have heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| They're not from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Many are not even from this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| And they are going to get rid of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| They're not going to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| So, there's going to be some opportunist come along that has little or no interest in where this is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| and the current zoning, it will be hodgepodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| And we would ask, as Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| we would ask you to ask MPC to do a small area study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| try to come up with a plan so that we can unify and codify how this area is going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| That being all the business to come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7877)|
| 2:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091020?start=7892)|
