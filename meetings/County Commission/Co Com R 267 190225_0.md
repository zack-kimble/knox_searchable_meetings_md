| 0:08:27| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Now, Commissioner Beeler, to set the tone for a good meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| I'd like to ask you to lead us in a devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| When Chairman Nystrom asked me to give the devotional today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| I thought back to July when I first began to seek the Lord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| and to pray about whether to seek appointment to this seat for the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| And as I began to pray through that, the Lord led me to Psalm 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| And I just want to share a couple of thoughts from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| and share with you the first four verses of Psalm 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| The psalmist says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| May he judge your people with righteousness and your poor with justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people and the hills in righteousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| May he defend the cause of the poor of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| give deliverance to the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| There are two things I think that we see in this psalm that those in government must remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| And the first is that we are to be people of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Several times in this psalm, the psalmist prays to give justice to the king| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| and may he defend the cause of the poor and the needy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| We just ended the Pledge of Allegiance with the words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| And justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| I think our most important job as the people's representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| is to do all within our power to ensure as level a playing field as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| for the people we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| In this constitutional republic that we're privileged to live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| we can't guarantee equal outcomes for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| but we must ensure and do everything in our power that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| to ensure equal opportunity, equal protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| and equal rights for all the people we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| It's interesting that this psalm was written by Solomon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| who was the son of King David, and in his last words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| David began them by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| He that ruleth over men must be just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| And in writing this psalm, Solomon reminds us of another very important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| and that is that governing has a generational impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| For every one of us sitting here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| and for every person who sits in any seat of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| the decisions we make today will impact future generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| perhaps even more profoundly than our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| And it's very important that we keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| It's a sobering thought, but it's also an amazing privilege and honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| that we've been entrusted with as representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| So I want to invite you to bow your heads and a word of prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| Father, as one bought with the blood of your son, I come to you in his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| and I thank you for this opportunity that we have, this honor, this privilege we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| to hear the voice of your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| to make decisions based on their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| based on that which would be fair and just for all our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| So I ask your wisdom, Lord, as we deliberate and debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| and perhaps vote and make decisions that will be in the best interest of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| and that will be in the interest of justice for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Father, I want to, on a personal note, thank you that Commissioner Daley is back with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| and I just continue to pray for health for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| And Lord, we just offer these prayers in the name of the one who died for the sins of the world, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| It's in his name we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Next on our agenda, what I'd like to do is I've got quite a few other elected officials in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| and folks that were grateful to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So I'm going to take a few minutes to thank and recognize those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| We've got Mayor Jacobs. Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| I know you'll be coming up on the agenda shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| We've got Sheriff Tom Spangler. I believe the sheriff is here in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you for joining us, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Is Charlie Susano here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Where is Charlie? He usually hides in the back somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| So he may have ducked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| I'll have to call Sister Paulina on him from our elementary school days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| Nick McBride, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Nick, I thought I saw you in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Where did he go? He and Charlie must be together somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Also, Super Bob Thomas, the superintendent of our schools, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| Louise Pavlin from the Farragut vice mayor, I think she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Also, anyone who wishes to speak at public forum, I do have several that approached the office earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| but if you're someone that does want to speak at public forum, I would recommend approaching Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| If you could raise your hand over there and she will let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| We usually will have, as we're about to begin a public forum at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| we'll also make sure at the end of the meeting, before we finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| that everybody has a chance to speak and address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| I also have a number of items that I may kind of steer some of that discussion towards specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| So thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Moving into setting our agenda, I want to say this has been, for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| an unprecedented week in Knox County and Tennessee history with these storms and the floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| I mean, not since the blizzard of 93 can I ever recall something that has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| in such a negative and impactful way, hit all facets of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| It's been tough. It's been challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| And we've got so many public servants in our community that have exceeded the expectations of their roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| and their jobs to help our public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| And I know I speak for all of our commission when we want to share with you how grateful we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| Tonight, in kind of a shift in light of these floods, I know we as a commission have got a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| and would like to be updated on some of the things that have happened from roads to emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| So I know Mayor Jacobs has been working really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| So what I'm going to do tonight is I'm going to ask Mayor Jacobs to begin an update of kind of what's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| with his team and his direct reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| As part of that, I have Jim Snowden, who I know is going to be providing an update on roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Colin Ikes around the Emergency Management Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and probably I know we've got, I see Jerry from AMR who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So I know all of those folks have done a really hard-working job of rescues and saves in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| So I'd like them to all kind of give us an update right on the front end of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| So Mayor Jacobs, would you go ahead and approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| In addition to those department heads that you mentioned, Paul White from Parks and Rec is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| I appreciate all the work that all of our departments have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| As you said, they always go above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| And in that regard, I'll let them give you the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| But I'd actually like to read a tweet that was directed at me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| It's from Christina in Powell, and she writes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Please pass along our sincerest thanks and gratitude to everyone who is working so hard to clean up and keep the roads safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| We live in Powell and needed to get out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| The roads were great and bad areas were clearly marked and easy to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| I'd like to add my thanks to that tweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| As they always do, county employees went above and beyond to take care of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Very special thanks to the Knox County Sheriff's Office, the staff at E911 and our Emergency Management Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| Rural Metro AMR, the Knox County Rescue Squad, and Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| We also shouldn't forget about the nonprofits, the churches, the volunteer groups, and our neighbors who stepped up and will continue to step up to help those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1000)|
| 0:16:50| Although it no longer surprises me, I am still amazed at the strength, generosity, and empathy of our community, especially in times of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1010)|
| 0:16:59| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I guess Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1023)|
| 0:17:16| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I gave Drusilla a jump drop there with a little presentation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| It's kind of rough because we've been a little busy, but I did want to kind of give you a feel in a visual sense what our guys have been dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| That first slide there actually happened today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| That is luckily, in general, we were fairly lucky in the sense TDOT had multiple, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| somewhere in the neighborhood of 26 roads that actually had landslides, road slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| We only had this one here and two smaller locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| But if you can see from that picture there, that's on Everett Road just north of Buttermilk, about a 40-foot slope failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| That will take about 1,000 tons of rock to fill it, and we're in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| As you can see there, it's kind of perilous conditions trying to excavate down to get the good material to repair the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| We kind of got the machine stuck, and we're in the process now of trying to get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| So just to give you a little bit of an idea of what our guys deal with in a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| That next slide there kind of gives you, I guess, some hydrology information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| You hear a lot about rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| So I just want to kind of give you a brief idea of what we dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| The 24-hour total for Saturday was 4.54 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| It was a little more than that at Sharps Ridge and Knox County, but that actually correlates to just a 25-year storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| which doesn't sound like much, but it was because we had such a long duration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| which if you'll look down through there, the 30-day total was 13-plus inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| so the ground was just very, very saturated, and the infiltration was a lot less than it normally would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| And the week preceding that was over 8 inches of rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| so you can kind of get a feel for what kind of conditions we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| The next page there is just kind of a general summary of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| As Mayor Jacobs indicated, my guys did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| They're hard workers, and they jumped in and worked all weekend long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| We had a total of 365 man-hours worked this weekend, so everybody jumped in and was really cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| Estimated labor cost of that is about $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Estimated construction cost, including that stone that I mentioned previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| as well as just asphalt, tree removal, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| will probably estimate somewhere in the neighborhood of around $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| A couple of other just statistics there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| At one point, we had over 65 roads closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| We have got that down to 26 right now, so we're making headway best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| and there's some of our partners' numbers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| You can see City of Knoxville has 15 roads, and Farragut doesn't have any roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| To give you kind of perspective, though, we maintain about 2,200 centerline miles of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| Town of Farragut has a couple of hundred, and the City of Knoxville has about 7 or about 1,000 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| so those numbers are fairly proportionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| And then just a couple of the last thing I'll mention is just some general summary of damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| kind of show you the three locations we did have damage on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| One is Pine Hill Drive off of the Commission District 6 off of Loveless Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| a culvert under the road separated and washed a big hole in the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| We have repaired that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| We've got the pipe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We still have some final replacements to do, but the pipe isn't replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| The most major damage we had was on Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| As you can see, the previous slide was where we had the track hoe down in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| A section of slope gave way, and we're having to reconstruct that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| This road carries about 2,500 cars a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| so it's a significant inconvenience to folks in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| and we're hopeful to have this road reopened by the end of the week, weather permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| The last damaged section of road is Diggs Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I believe that's in Commissioner Bussler's Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| It essentially water got under the seam of a section of asphalt and washed out a portion of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| We worked on that today and should have that open for traffic tomorrow, weather permitting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| As you can see there, 1,200 cars a day, so while these roads do impact a lot of the folks we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| And then the last thing I had, I just wanted to kind of speak a little bit about some of the flooding examples that we've all seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| But just to kind of make note of, essentially, it's fairly consistent with a 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| Most of our flood maps show the flood elevations being consistent with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| You can see at George Williams Road there, that little short connector from Peters Road over to Ebenezer is completely underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1324)|
| 0:22:13| It's probably five feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| So that's an indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| The next one was West Beaver Creek at Fair Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| A major collector carries 6,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| It's still inundated with water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| We have the road closed and are not exactly sure when the water may recede,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| but that's obviously a busy roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| And you can see in the map in the lower left-hand corner that the floodway kind of coincides with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| Just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| An example in East Knoxville is Childs Road, rural road, but once again the stream is very close to the road right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| and has overwhelmed it and closed it to through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| And the last thing that I actually spoke with Chairman Nystrom about was North Shore Drive, State Route 332.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| This road conveys about 25,000 cars a day, one of the busier roads in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| I spoke with TDOT about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| We've installed some signage at Whittington Creek Boulevard to try to assist those folks trying to get around the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| Essentially, North Shore is flooded with water from the west entrance of Whittington Creek to west of Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1400)|
| 0:23:31| So there's a long section in there that is approximately, per TDOT today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| said it was about 43 inches deep at the center line of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| And TVA is right now reducing the water elevation about one foot a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| So at this rate, it could be several more days before North Shore Drive is passable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| And just one of the later slides there in regard to North Shore is just the number of homes affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| There are a couple of subdivisions, Coddington Court and North Shore Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| and sections of Scott Lane and Bass Lane that do not have good access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| We're looking at options for that, but there are not many or there are not good options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| So there are some folks in there that are dealing with some hardships, and we're going to try our best to assist in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Well, and I might add, the folks up at Whittington Creek have let the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| you've got a lot of folks at the nursing home at Little Creek that it's been tough to gain access right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| And I know the Whittington Creek folks have been allowing them to gain access through that clubhouse there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| That's been a pretty high-risk area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| So if there's anybody from Whittington Creek here tonight, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| And the last slide I had was just – or one of the last slides was just our arterial roadways that we have in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| Ebenezer, Peters, and Westland are all closed right now, and they're all arterial roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| and they average anywhere from 10,000 cars a day to 20,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| So you can see it is putting a significant impact on our roadway network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| and we appreciate everybody's patience as we try to get these roads repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Last and all, I just want to thank my guys that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| They came in and worked all weekend long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| We've had people on the clock for the last 48 hours straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| So I just want to thank my guys for their hard work because they did a great job out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I see Paul, you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Paul White, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| First of all, I just want to thank the mayor and his staff for their leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| and their constant communication with us during this storm and the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| and just wanted to really give them kudos for that and just how they stayed in constant contact with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| So we had – based on weather reports, we knew that Saturday was going to be an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| so we got together Friday and put together a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| So I met with our Director of Parks, Chuck James, Deputy Director Mike Dinella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| to go ahead and have a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| We had crews go out Saturday, and when it became too dangerous, we had them come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| But we got a lot of intel on Saturday, a lot of pictures and an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| So yesterday morning, Chuck and Joe Inman secured a dock at Maloney Road Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| That dock had broken and floated off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| Myself and Mike Dinella visited some of the more heavily flooded areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| and we put together work orders so we would have a proactive plan this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| We spent roughly six hours going through the parks yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| During those visits, we met with members of the public to talk about the damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| and in several cases, we were able to discuss with them the dangers of the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| And we also used social media, again, to remind folks of the dangers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| and we're trying to get ahead of any kind of dangerous situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| In regards to our recreation side, we had basketball tournaments taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| over the weekend at several local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| All of those went on as scheduled with the exception of Cedar Bluff Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| which canceled the 10-U game due to flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| and it won't be made up since the players and coaches received their awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| This morning, we met with all the crews, had them go through every county park and ball field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| and they determined that the majority of our damages are actually tied to cleanup only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Commissioner and Commission, we mostly are dealing with debris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| We had crews go out today, and in some of the places, the Halls Greenway is completely flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| We were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| We mostly are looking at cleanup in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| We cleared greenways from Cedar Bluff to 10-Mile Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| That's about two and a half miles of greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| That included picking up trash, and we cut down four large trees that had obstructed the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| And one note, I'm going to give the guys at our sports park in Carnes a great compliment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| is that they got two fields up and running so we can have middle school baseball tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| and the fields look immaculate, which is hard to believe with the amount of rain we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| So I wanted to give those guys a shout-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| And I don't know if you guys have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| All right, next I've got Colin from the Emergency Management Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Colin, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| You're not going to try his last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Icus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Yeah, I was going to keep it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| My name is Colin Icus, Director of Emergency Management, 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update and a briefing on the ongoing flood situation here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| So this started about a week and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| We started getting reports of some alarming amounts of rain from the National Weather Service forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| Fortunately, I should say not exactly fortunately, those forecasts decreased over the past last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| and we thought we might get by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| But then this late Friday evening, rainfall totals forecast went back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| and we found ourselves in trouble Friday evening into Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| At about 8.35 Saturday morning, we made the decision to activate the Emergency Operations Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| The EOC is the central point of coordination, collaboration, and information sharing for emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| So we had representatives there from all of our local emergency response agencies from across the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| I'd like to thank Mayor Jacobs and also Sheriff Spangler for joining us in the Emergency Operations Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| Over the course of the day Saturday and throughout the event, there were well over 100 water rescues across the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| Most of those were fairly routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| However, there was one case where a fairly complex swift water rescue where, frankly, the safety of those involved was not at all assured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1812)|
| 0:30:22| And so I'm very grateful, and I want to pass along my kudos to all of the emergency response agencies in the county for doing such a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| and providing great service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Unfortunately, Saturday night there was one death when a car drove into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| The driver was rescued. Responders attempted to resuscitate him, and unfortunately, I'm sad to say he did not survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| Our focus Saturday was on the life safety and emergency response aspects of the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| So as well as the rescues going on, we had great collaboration with both of our city, county, engineering, public works folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| who worked hard to close the affected roads in order to try to prevent further tragedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| Overnight, the emergency operation center closed, but we reopened at 7 in the morning on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Frankly, we were very concerned about the National Weather Service's predictions of high winds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| They were predicting 20-mile-per-hour winds with gusts of over 30 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Frankly, we were thinking that we were likely to have a second disaster as all the trees came down that were in saturated soil and caused further harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1881)|
| 0:31:31| Fortunately, although there were a few isolated tree issues, it was not the widespread catastrophic issue we feared that it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| Sunday, as we closed out the emergency phase, we turned our attention to damage assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Sunday afternoon, we had teams, we had emergency responders doing windshield surveys for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| reporting back damages so that we could find the locations that would need further follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| in terms of quantifying and counting all the damage that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| Today, we sent ten teams of emergency responders into the field across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| in order to do damage assessment on every affected property and categorize them according to FEMA criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| working ultimately towards a potential federal disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| Our goal right now is to accurately document all the damage to homes and businesses across the county to see if we may qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1941)|
| 0:32:30| Just a little bit of background information there, there are two types of disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| There's individual assistance, which is federal aid to homeowners or people who are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| There's a little bit of gray area in the criteria, the judgment that FEMA uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| They look at things like the number of homes affected, whether or not these homes were insured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| the impact on vulnerable populations to make a decision about whether or not we will get individual assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| The other category is public assistance, so individual and public assistance are treated quite separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| Public assistance is the reimbursement of local government costs as well as utility costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Knox County, it's based on a per capita number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| Knox County has a threshold of a little over $1.6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| so in order for us to get public assistance and be eligible for reimbursement of some of our costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| we have to prove damages of a little over $1.6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| as well as the state as a whole has to document damages of about $9.5 million in order to qualify for public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| If we make that threshold, then the federal government would reimburse 75% of local government costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| Right now, it's too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Again, we've got responders out in the field now who are just now starting to bring back their data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| so it's really too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| As well, we've started talking to our departments about calculating their costs related to the storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| but it's too soon to even hazard a guess about whether or not we may be eligible and make thresholds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| I will say that in gathering damage data, we've heard many heartbreaking stories of loss for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| and we know that that's just the tip of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| At current count, and these are very, very preliminary numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| we know of at least 613 homes and 174 businesses that have been impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| Again, we think that's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| We think we're likely to find more of those as we continue the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| We're asking anyone whose home or business was affected to please call 311 to report the damage so that we can count that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2078)|
| 0:34:49| We'll send a team out to look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| They will not need to go inside, but to categorize it according to FEMA standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| again, to gather the data to make our case to try to get a disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| Excuse me, Colin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Is 311, that's a city organization, are they gathering county information also and passing it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| They've agreed to work with us and gather, be the single point for all city and county reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I will say that recovery will be a long-term issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| Those that are affected are going to have a long road ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Those that have had flood damage to their homes, we've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| We've heard of damage from homes being nearly entirely underwater to something as little as a puddle in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| But for those who have serious effects, this is going to be a long-term issue and is going to cause a great deal of heartache for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| It already has and will continue to for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| So we ask for continued thoughts and prayers for those affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| I'm happy to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I'm sure we're going to have a few questions specifically for you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| I see a light from Commissioner Jay, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| I spoke with Commissioner Bussler earlier today about our residents accessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| You said there was a government FEMA declaration at an individual level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| How are we going to communicate this to the rank and file, the guy whose home has been damaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| How will they know how to even apply for assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| Tell me, based on your knowledge, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| One of our best tools is our media partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| We're going to ask all of our local media organizations to push that out and make that the headline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| if we are successful in getting a disaster declaration, to try to spread the word and make sure everyone in the community hears about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| We've also, in the course of collecting the locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| we've also gotten contact information for many of the homes of the folks who are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| So we're going to be reaching out to them for the ones that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| We have several hundred contacts right now to make sure they are aware of any aid that might be available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| I know you can't commit, but do you feel relatively confident that we can get the declaration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Sir, I would really hate to guess, because it would just be a guess at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| I can tell you, so again, we've got individual assistance for homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| and again, FEMA is not very clear to us about how they make that judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| Again, that's really just a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| On the public assistance side for government, public sector costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| usually what makes or breaks us are the utility restoration costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| When KUB, LCUB have to repair a bunch of poles and lines and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| that's what brings the cost up for us to meet that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| And frankly, we have not seen the huge utility outages that would necessitate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| So it would be a guess and a really big assumption to say that we might be on track to qualify for that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Could you help us understand the difference between a TEMA state of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| and you've explained a little bit on the FEMA level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| but I noticed that I think they declared that on Friday or Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| What does that actually mean, and how is it relevant to the public at large?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| So the difference for us, frankly, is the number of dollar signs involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| For a state declaration of emergency, that gives the governor certain powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| and lets state government and their departments do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| That does not come with any state funding or any kind of federal assistance for us here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| It's a mechanism for a state to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| If it looks like we're going to meet our thresholds on both sides of the disaster declaration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| if it looks like we're heading in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| then the governor will ask the president for a federal disaster declaration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| and that one comes with assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Again, reimbursement of local government costs as well as potentially federal aid for homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| and local folks affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Commissioner Jay, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Sir, of the roughly 613 private residents that have been affected by this flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and you may not have had the opportunity yet to sit down and analyze this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| but do you know the percentage that were within the FEMA 100-year flood plan and which were out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| We're partnering with KGIS on some of the mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| so we'll try to get them to help us map that out and get an answer for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Colin, let me ask you some of the things that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Well, one of the things that's happened in my district was we had some houses that had the sewer line back up in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| It wasn't water damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| It was from the sewer line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Is that something that they can ask for assistance on too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| If it's related to the storm events, then we would like to know about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| and we're going to use that to build our case to the state and to FEMA to try to get our disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| It's probably a different matter with their insurance about whether that may or may not be covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| but, yes, we would absolutely like to know about that to try to bolster our case for a disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Colin, what I might ask, I think most of our commissioners here are pretty in touch with their constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| and if it would be helpful for all of us to, say, post on our personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| or our commissioner social media accounts, for example, if you've had damage, please report it to 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| just to encourage this reporting data, which could help us be designated on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| Is that something that would be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Yes, sir, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I would appreciate it if you could help spread the word with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Could you state, and for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I'm going to ask exactly what you'd like to have us to post on our personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| and our commissioner social media accounts to help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Just email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Or just, yes, send us an email after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| You can send it to Drusilla or through the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| If you could send that, you know, think about it, send it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| and I'll make sure Drusilla gets it out to everybody so we can help spread that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Commissioner Gill has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| That was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| To coordinate those efforts through 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| And are we requesting, as people reach out, will 311 ask people to have photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| or someone's coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Could you just re-cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| So 311 will ask for the address and just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| they've got a couple questions about the nature of the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Was the home flooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Were there trees down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| And kind of check a few boxes for us like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Once we get that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| we will send a damage assessment crew to look from the street at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| It's not no one will ask to come into the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| It's not necessary for the homeowner to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| but to look from the outside to satisfy FEMA's damage assessment criteria, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| so we know how to categorize that as we present that data and run it up the chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Did I answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you, Colin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| I've got one last speaker to provide an update on our rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| and that's Jerry Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Jerry, if you could kind of give us an update on what AMR Rural Metro has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| I know you guys have been slammed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| I'm Jerry Harnish, 160 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| I'm the Fire Chief for Rural Metro Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I have with me today also Chris Blotch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| who's the Regional Director for AMR on the ambulance side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| So I think, if anything, Colin was being modest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| If it weren't for the Emergency Management Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| it would be very difficult for the other emergency responders in this community to do what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| I can tell you this, we've been responding to this weekend's event for the last nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| Several of us were deployed either to Davidson County or Cheatham County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| as part of the statewide mutual aid program in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| As a result of that response, through the Homeland Security District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| we had an A-list team come in and do training for Knoxville and Knox County in December of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| So we've known this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We didn't know what day, but that's paid dividends for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| I don't know the entirety of the water rescues in the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| I know in the county area there were 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| What I can tell you is that it's kind of like Oscar night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| You go to commercial before you finish all the thank yous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| In almost every instance, the responses were necessarily multi-agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| So when you look at photographs of several of these water rescues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| what you'll notice is Carnes Fire, Knoxville Fire, Rural Metro Fire, Seymour Fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| Knoxville Rescue Squad, AMR, the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| Knoxville Police are all represented in different numbers literally at each incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| I think the pace of the emergency work certainly started to slow down overnight on Saturday and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| Personally, I felt like we were more into trying to do recovery work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| So, you know, today we're in a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| As you saw from Mr. Snowden, we still have areas of the community that are inundated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| and now the assessment work has really just begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| So I don't want to repeat everything Colin said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| I think he did a wonderful job doing a summation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Do you have any questions about the emergency response side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Any questions, my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| I think that's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Moving on in our public forum, I have all of that for our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| These updates have been part of our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| We don't normally bring in a whole lot of updates on that when we conduct these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| but this is definitely extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Moving back to the traditional part of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| I have on my list Miriam Nelson contacted the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| and expressed an interest in speaking at public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| So if you'd like to approach, please, Miriam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| if you could state your name and address for the record, and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| My name is Miriam Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| I live at 2833 White Oak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| I've spoken to the commission before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| and I want to speak again about the conditions at the Knox County Jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| in specific the face-to-face visitation rights that have been denied for, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| over two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| I certainly wish for the public to know more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| I have found out some things today that I would like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| I was looking online for studies that may have been done within jail visitation rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| and I just happened to find one from a company, a site called Artechnica.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| and it's certainly not specific to prisoners' rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| But I'd like to read from that, if that's acceptable to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| It has a great deal of things to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| but what absolutely floored me is it was specific to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| and published, let's see, May 14th in 2018 by a gentleman from Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2824)|
| 0:47:14| So it says, as you know, jails are replacing visits with video calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| Inmates and families hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| We tried one of the awful video services many jails offer instead of visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| This is specific to a certain person when Rebecca Carr visited her nephew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| Pardon me for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| It may be inappropriate for me to say a name at a meeting, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| Recently at the Knox County Jail in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| she did not get the opportunity to see him face to face or even through glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| Instead, she was ushered into a cramped, crowded room for a video visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| She talked to him on the telephone handset while watching a grainy video feed of his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| She states, I have experienced prison visitation a lot in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| She told ours, the name of this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Her father spent some time in prison when she was a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| This was the most dehumanizing and impersonal that I've ever experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| I have visited through glass before, and that broke my heart when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| This was even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| I'd like to remind the commission, this was specific to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| It could have been chosen anywhere in the United States by this particular author.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| Other things that this says, in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| more and more jails have introduced these services, the video calling services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Theoretically, these products would make it easier for inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| to maintain their relationships with families and friends outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| But many jails have moved in the opposite direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| using the advent of this, quote, video visitation services as an excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| to restrict or eliminate traditional in-person visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| I'm skipping through some of this since I am timed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Jails also profit more directly from limiting in-person visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| While on-site video visits are usually free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| the companies providing the system generally offer paid-off site video calling service too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| I believe all of you are familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Jails get a hefty percentage of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| This particular gentleman, I wanted to try the remote calling technology for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| so I arranged to call someone at the Knox County Jail's remote video calling service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| The call cost 19 cents per minute and was noticeably worse than a FaceTime or Skype call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| It was grainy and jerky, periodically freezing up altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| though it was not as bad as the hellish demonstration video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| The software required my face to stay centered in the video frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| If my face left the frame, the video went dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Again, I'd like to remind the Commission this was specific to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I was shocked to find it published in May and a bit embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| So I would like very much to make sure all of you are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| I'd like the public to know that a lawsuit has been filed relative to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| which restricts a lot of your comments, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| I would like to ask every one of you to read that lawsuit specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Next, I have one other guest who wanted to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| It's Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| He indicated that he wanted to speak to Item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| If it's pleasing for Mr. Murphy, I will save your comments until we get to that item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We are now at the point of our agenda where we have honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| So, Madam Clerk, would you bring up our first one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| This is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| It's honoring developer Rick Dover and architect Daniel Levy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| for the historic Knoxville High Project being named America's Best Senior Living Renovation Project for 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Before we go through this, is Rick here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| There you are, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Rick, could both of you guys come up and please go ahead and approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| And what we'll do tonight, this was sponsored by Commissioner Biggs and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| so I'm going to go ahead and let Madam Clerk go ahead and read it into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| and then we'll go ahead and present this recognition for both of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| It's really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Let's go ahead and vote first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Commissioner Biggs, could you make a motion for approval, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| There's a motion to approve by Commissioner Biggs and a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3159)|

| 0:57:44| Okay. Yes. Okay. We now have done honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| The next thing on our agenda will be we will pass the minutes and then we will set the agenda for what we'll be working on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3469)|
| 0:57:57| So the chair will entertain a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| Okay. The motion's been made by Commissioner Smith and a second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| All in favor, please say aye. Aye. All opposed. Please say nay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| For the public, this is the part of the meeting where we formalize and set our actual agenda of things that we'll be voting on, discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| and coming to a conclusion on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| One small change to the agenda that I'd like to ask my fellow commissioners to indulge me in is we have one very brief presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3504)|
| 0:58:33| not something for discussion, but a very short presentation from the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| Martha had asked us, or Dr. Buchanan, excuse me, had asked if we could move that up towards the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| If that's acceptable for the commission, I'd like to indulge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Seeing all nods, Madam Clerk, that is item number 52 that we will move towards the front for that quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| Most of our other discussion items do require more actual discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| Now to review, we have some adds, withdraws, and to review our non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| Commissioner Bussler, we spoke today about adding a discussion item around the FEMA and the TEMA declarations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| I want to find out, was the discussion earlier, did that help clarify your concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Mr. Chair, what I was seeing is if we didn't have TEMA or FEMA or something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| is there another avenue that people could look at and take it, and where would they get to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| And I think they've answered most of those questions by 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Then we will not, if I'm clarifying, we will not be adding that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| All right. Items number 56 and 34 are withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| Item number 8, and I want some clarification from this is a school item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| and Purchasing had mentioned this to me before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| I want to confirm if item 8 is going to be put on a 30-day push to next month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| if I could get someone from either Schools or Purchasing to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Matt Myers, I think that was something we discussed right before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| If you could clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3617)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Matt Myers, Knotts County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Yes, sir, we're looking at the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| It was something that was not caught last week, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| I believe Mr. Roswick, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| All right. So I believe that one was on our consent agenda originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| So we will now need for the record to show that it will be pulled from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| and will be postponed for 30 days to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| All right. The other, Mr. Anders, I'll go through the list and then I'll have your ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| But the other non-consent items are item 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| This one was originally on consent, but there have been some minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| This was the traffic study for North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Then items 1, 2, 3, 17, 38, 39, 44, 48, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, and 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3677)|
| 1:01:39| If you'd like, I can say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| All right. I'll go one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| One, item 49 is being pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| The other non-consent items were 1, 2, 3, 17, 38, 39, 44, 48, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3709)|
| 1:02:12| All right. Other changes? Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Yes, sir. In regards to the CTAS presentation, I think if we can move that behind the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| The people that are most interested have had a fairly rough 72 hours, and the presenter needs to drive back to Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| So if we can move that up, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| All right. Seeing general nods at the commission, Madam Clerk, if you could make a note of that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you. Did you say the item 34 from the health department was withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| All right. Are there any additional changes for our agenda from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| Okay. The chair will entertain a motion to set our – yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3774)|

| 1:04:39| those being mental health, opioid abuse, tobacco use, and active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| So we appreciate the folks that have done a great job of cleaning up the community in the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Our current effort spans 2016 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| This is our annual report, but our final report will be coming out in June of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| There are local organizations that are helping with the improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Those are the Mental Health Task Force, the Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force under the Metro Drug Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| Smokefree Knoxville, and Active Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| Over the past years, our partners have done many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| A few of them have been breaking new ground in data collection and analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| improved outreach to people struggling with addiction, educating policy makers, medical professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| parents and children on some of the most pressing health issues in our community, amongst other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| Some of the improvements we've seen trending are decreases in adult suicide rate, amount of opioids prescribed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3945)|
| 1:05:54| smoking rates among youth and pregnant women have declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| Please note that this does not include data on vaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| That's not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| We still have a lot of work to do in some areas, such as opioid overdose deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| suicides among youth, and pedestrian and bicycle crashes with cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| We passed out the 2018 annual report that has more specific details for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| And if you have questions, you can please check the healthyknox.org website or contact us at knoxchc at gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3985)|
| 1:06:38| We don't have any specific ask from you at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| except to say please keep health at the forefront when you are making policy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| We'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| And we look forward to the opportunities to work together that may arise from our community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Some of my fellow commissioners may have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Seeing none, thank you so much for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| I know you all put a lot of time and effort into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Item number 53, presentation of the emergency services study by CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commission, and those that are here in interest of this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| The history of this is we, a couple of years ago, appointed a committee on this very commission about three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| to kind of look into the needs we have, the current status of our fire and emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| and then the needs we may have in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| And that committee kind of died out due to lack of interest, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| But we've asked CTAS to come in and do a study that really has no influence from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4065)|
| 1:07:56| And so there's no political look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| There's no cost look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| They just give us call balls and strikes for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| So Kevin has worked diligently over the wildfires and some other statewide issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| But as this study has been done, I appreciate his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| I appreciate each agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| I appreciate KGIS for stepping forward with the mapping, the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| Everybody contributed to the report, and I appreciate their cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| So, Kevin, if you would present the report, and then we'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| Kevin, what I might ask, for the benefit of the folks watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| and for the folks in our audience who may not be familiar with exactly what or who CTAS is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| would you mind giving just a one-minute description of the Institute of Public Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| at the University of Tennessee and what CTAS' role in that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| I'll try that in one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Well, you can take a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| I think it's important for the community to know exactly who you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| and where the grassroots of the University of Tennessee's Public Service Institute is helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| So CTAS, or the County Technical Assistance Service, is part of the Institute for Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| It's one of five or six agencies that are designed to help local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| law enforcement, and the industry throughout the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| We work with all 95 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| We have a number of field consultants that work, have a smaller territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| We have specialists like myself and our law enforcement and jails consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| solid waste, and some other areas that work statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| So we're spread out a little bit further and a bit of a challenge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| But our goal is to help you make better decisions to help improve county government throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| We work with state officials as well on various projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And as Commissioner Andrews said, we try to look at this very impartially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| We don't have a stake in the outcome of this and just try to look at the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| and to give you the information that you need to help make those decisions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4198)|
| 1:10:06| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Go ahead and proceed, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Let me say one thing also real fast before I get into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| I do want to give a kudos to the director of the EMA, Mr. Ickes, and for the Knox County EMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| because this is one of the, with working with the 95 counties across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| we try to use some places that are doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| And this emergency management office is very lean, but they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| They engage all the emergency responders in the community every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| And that's one of the things that I, as I work with other places, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| hey, you need to go look and see what Knox County is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| because there's a lot of emergency management offices that could get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| So that has nothing to do with this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| but I just want to say that in light of all the events that went on this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| All right, with that being said, I want to give just a quick overview, and if you're okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| I want to sit back down so that I can see my screen and move this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Make sure you pull the microphone down so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| So as Commissioner Andrews said, the resolution was passed asking for our help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| to come in and look at your fire and rescue situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| The wording of that basically was evaluation of the fire and rescue services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| currently provided in Knox County and the county's potential future needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| and report back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| That was further defined as looking at current station locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| coverage in the response areas, status of equipment and apparatus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| staffing levels, funding, and also the interdepartmental working relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| This was not intended to be a management review of any of the agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| so we didn't go down to the weeds as to how they're doing specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| This is looking at big picture stuff, where you're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| and based upon where you need to go with your population increases and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| and we'll talk about that in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| We did include Farragut as far as in the study because of the relationship with rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| and their stations work obviously inside and outside of the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| so some of the numbers you see there does include Farragut in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4324)|
| 1:12:15| I think each of you have received a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| It's kind of thick, so this is a high-level overview of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| If you have any questions, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| but it's probably best just to go back and to dive into it deeper further on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| If we need to come back and clarify anything in a workshop or whatever, we'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| The first part of the study talks about the history of Knox County Emergency Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| and it's got a very interesting history in the fact of how the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| just as in many places throughout the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| stood up to start providing fire and rescue services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| From pretty much the inception, the model for paying for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| was basically through subscription services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| There was highs and lows in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| and then as you see here, in 1956, the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad was started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| In 1964, the West Knox Fire Department was started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| and that was a subscription service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| In 1971, the Seymour Fire Department was started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| In between 1971 and 1974, there was a lot of studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| I think the East Tennessee Development District did some work here and throughout the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| looking at fire protection and improving the levels of fire safety throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| Several community departments were started up around that time as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| and in 1977, rural metro was contacted by West Knox to enter into a management agreement with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4421)|
| 1:13:50| and to help them on their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| Carnes Fire Department was started in 78, and then around the early 80s, 82, 83,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| there was a series of pretty big incident fires in West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| I'm sorry, I cover the whole state, so I get in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| That was just after the World's Fair time when there was a construction boom here in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| and that precipitated a few other things that went into motion at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| Right after that, the Knox County Fire Bureau was started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| and that was a very progressive move on the part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| And I'll say this, that really, even throughout the state right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| that is an exception rather than the rule as far as having that level of fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| and codes safeties in the unincorporated parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| So that was a very good move on the part of the county to start it and to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| In 1984, the rural metro assumed full responsibility for the West Knox Fire Department District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| and then their services began to increase throughout the county after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| In 2001, Carnes hired its first firefighters, so that was a daytime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Monday through Friday type of thing, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| just because the needs for staffing volunteer fire departments then as well as now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| and all volunteer agencies are a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| So that was the transitional date for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| One thing to kind of point out before we go any further is just some of the statutes related to fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| In 2006, I believe it was, or maybe it was 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| the Fire Department Recognition Act was passed by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| Basically what it did at that time is that it required all fire departments in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| to register with the fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| It made sure that no new fire departments would just spring up on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| without the commission and the mayor's approval and blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| and it also established that the chief of the fire department would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| the assistant commissioner of commerce and insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| and that's important because that's tied to certain emergency powers that the fire departments have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| things like entering private property when there's an emergency, various things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4566)|
| 1:16:15| The TCA 621703 is a series of those or a list of the emergency powers that are in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| that are tied to the Recognition Act and 68102108,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| and the first one, of course, is to control and direct the activities at the scene of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| Excuse me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Could you just identify if these slides are in our document that's presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| or these are not included, or just let us know when they're going to be up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| Most everything is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| The Fire Department Recognition Act, I just added that one in, so that's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Was the previous slide in our directory of the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| It is, but it's in the history part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| It's not in the slide itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| I just condensed about six pages into one slide there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| So that's in the history, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| I meant to say that before we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| So the population is something that, of course, I know that everyone here is concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| in the fact of how do we manage and to make sure that we provide the services for the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| and visitors of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| As you see here, this is a timeline of Census Bureau data from 1980 to 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| 2017 was the Census American Community Estimate for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| And then the 2030 and 2040 numbers there that you see on the population line at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| those are estimates from the UT's Boyd Center as to the population that Knox County will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| in those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| And you look at various studies, and they all have different numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| but we decided that the UT one was the most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| The other two numbers there, the two lines, are the trend lines for population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| So the gray is outside the city of Knoxville, and the orange is inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| And around the early 90s, those numbers evened out about half and half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| And then since that time period, the population has increased in unincorporated areas quite significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| And the trend line that you do see here is that's an Excel model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| So as we go toward the future, those lines may be closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| There's a lot of thoughts that the millennial generation will move more urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| so your city population may be higher in the county either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| But regardless, the county is going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| And so those are things that we have to look at to help with our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| So here's a map on a density map using GIS technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| As Commissioner Andrews said, we greatly do appreciate the help that we got from KGIS with all the data for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4738)|
| 1:19:07| So this is on page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| And this basically just shows where the populations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| So the red colors are the less dense areas and the darker colors, the blues and the greens, are the more dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4757)|
| 1:19:27| This is nothing that you all don't already know, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| The west and the short north are more densely populated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| This is a percentage of building footprints, and there are a number of maps in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| just to kind of set the things up as to where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| On page 14 is a parcel by tax class map, and it shows agriculture, residential, commercial, industrial, and other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4787)|
| 1:19:57| And then those are tied to some other figures within the study a little bit further down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| And there's that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| So on the next slide here shows the density of commercial and industrial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| And those, once again, are the Farragut, short west areas, Carnes, Powell, Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4815)|
| 1:20:25| And then there's a couple pockets related to where there's industrial-type facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| It doesn't mean that's where all of those are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| That's just where they're the most densely located in the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| So one of the things that we did look at is the coverage areas of the existing stations that are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| And this is a GIS modeling showing the mile-and-a-half, two-and-a-half miles, and five-mile driving zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| And the reason that the five miles is significant is that for ISO purposes, which is what's tied to insurance rates in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4852)|
| 1:21:02| the five driving miles is the limit that they'll recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| And so many structures that are located beyond five miles, they, in most cases, get a Class 10 rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| All counties have areas that are beyond five miles because it's very difficult to cover everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| especially the way that our counties are drawn in Tennessee in very unusual shapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| So this just shows you where the driving distances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| And then there's the percentages there showing the coverage areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| So there's approximately 89 percent of the structures in Knox County outside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| are within five driving miles of a current fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| Taking that number and using that information, we took and did another GIS model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4910)|
| 1:21:58| showing the density of buildings that are beyond that five driving miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| So this just kind of shows you the hot spots of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| This doesn't show, obviously, every single one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Some of those are right on the tip of the city, and then some of those are way out in the county, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4927)|
| 1:22:16| So those are things that we like to use as we're looking long-term planning toward, do we need to add additional facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| There's the balance of cost versus the coverages that you obviously have to take into account as you look at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4943)|
| 1:22:33| The next map here starts on page 22, and basically this is modeling driving times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4953)|
| 1:22:43| So this is just taking the KGS data as well as the data from ESRI, the GIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4963)|
| 1:22:52| and just figuring how far can a fire truck go in a certain time periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| So this one is a five-minute driving zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| We know in Knox County, five minutes can be five or it can be 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| based upon the time of the day and the day of the week and with traffic and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| This is in a sterile, perfect environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| This is your coverages within five minutes of a fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| The next one is a couple of different layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| It's five, seven, and ten minutes, and there's the chart that goes with that showing the coverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| So even though we showed earlier that in the five-mile range it was 89 percent coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| within ten minutes of driving it's about 97 percent coverage for the fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5013)|
| 1:23:46| This map here shows the incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| That's about roughly 16,000 calls that are plotted on the map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| I know it's really hard to see up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Hopefully you can see it better in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Then we did some modeling of those to show where the concentration is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| As you see, most of the concentrations are in those areas around the cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| which we expect that because there's typically denser population growths that are near the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| One positive on this is that a number of these hot spots that you see are very close to where fire stations are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| So that does show that the fire departments have done a good job of knowing where their calls are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| and placement of the fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| This is a map that's wrote down by fire districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| So for the purpose of this study, we combined a couple of the districts just to make more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| Both the Seymour stations are combined into one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| and the Carnes, instead of having the four different station zones, we did them into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| So one of the paid stations in each of their zones, and then their other stations are part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| So this is a percentage by district of calls that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| And you see, once again, this shows what most of these folks here already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| West and Farragut and Cedar Bluff areas are very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| Halls is very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Powell as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| And then it starts decreasing the further you go into the more rural areas, which would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| So very quickly here, this is an overview of the services that are provided by the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| And this does not get down into the weeds of all of them for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| but it does give a quick kind of a baseline for where all that's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| The rural metro has two battalion chiefs on duty 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| They run out of 17 stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| Fourteen of those are advanced life support stations most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| They have a state-accredited hazardous materials type 2 team, which is a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| there's not many of those in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I think this was the first one in the state, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| They have a total of 156 full‑time personnel and 65 additional part‑time reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| And all of these numbers, of course, as far as personnel goes, those vary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| especially when you're looking at reserves and volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| because the departments from month to month and year to year, those things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| But at the time, this was a caption of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| Karnes, it does say KFD in here, so that's not the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| That's Karnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| Just for clarification purposes, has a daytime assistant chief on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| They have two other stations that run advanced life support, medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| Their two other stations are on call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| which means that if someone's in the area, they'll come and get the truck from those stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| But regardless, the paid trucks will go throughout their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| They run vehicle extrication as well, have operations level hazardous materials response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| 19 full‑time personnel, and about 25 reserve or volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| And then Seymour has, of course, as you know, Seymour runs in three counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| which is a big challenge for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| So within the Knox County portion, they have a daytime chief that's on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| They provide basic life support on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| They do have extrication at one of those stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| And they have about 72 volunteers amongst all six of their stations in Sevier, Blount, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5263)|
| 1:27:54| So this is just, once again, kind of an overview of the services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Row Metro does have a few additional kind of nontraditional services that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| They have two of their stations have an ambulance in there that are staffed by firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| They can be pulled into the EMS system when it gets down to a critical level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| but they're fire personnel that are on the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| As I said, they do provide ALS, BLS medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| They conduct a significant amount of public education programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| just as all the fire departments do here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| They do have a fire marshal that works inside the town of Farragut for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| and I think another inspector, as well as a couple of employees that work for the Knox County Fire Bureau as public educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| So it's a very good example of the partnerships that are between the fire department and the other local government agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5324)|
| 1:28:55| Carnes, as we mentioned earlier, has the fire and medical response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| Their dispatching is through Knox County 911, so it's a little bit of a different setup there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| They do pay for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| They have rope rescue and vehicle extrication capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| and they conduct the public education programs, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Seymour, we hit most of those points already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| They do, at this time, they have a federal grant that's helping them to pay a stipend for staffing by their volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5361)|
| 1:29:29| but that's set to run out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| I can't remember what the date is, but it's on a temporary basis to help provide some coverage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| And then the rescue squad does, of course, the vehicle and heavy extrication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| They do provide on-call medical responses, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| They have a tremendous amount of technical rescue teams that have been very well known throughout the region for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| Swift Water, Cave, Collapse, Trench, Vertical Rope, Dive, Combined Space, and Heavy Machinery and Farm Extrication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5397)|
| 1:30:08| Those teams are, like I said, very specialized entities and have a number of different folks that work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5408)|
| 1:30:18| The deputy chief is paid part-time, and it works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| They have approximately 60 volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Once again, those numbers go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| All volunteer agencies throughout the state have a challenge of recruiting and maintaining volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| That's a big challenge because it's very costly to train firefighters and especially rescue personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5437)|
| 1:30:46| And then when you lose them, you lose a lot of experience but also a lot of money that you have to reinvest back into the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| They do have an interesting arrangement with Rural Metro where they have nine of their personnel work in the fire stations on the rescue trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5454)|
| 1:31:04| Rural Metro pays their personnel to operate the rescue trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| and then the rescue squad obviously supplies the apparatus as well as their uniforms and gear and et cetera and the training with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5469)|
| 1:31:19| So that's a little bit of a different setup than what we see in most places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| So getting down to the funding part, here is a spreadsheet or a table from a spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5486)|
| 1:31:34| That is on page 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5494)|
| 1:31:46| So this shows from the last seven fiscal years the contributions that the Knotts County Commission has paid to the rescue squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5506)|
| 1:31:55| Seymour Fire Department, Karnes, and Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Rural Metro has not received any funding from the county directly due to the, I'm assuming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| the fact that they're a for-profit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| Karnes did not receive anything for the first three of those years, and then that has increased in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| And the total amount that the commission has paid out for emergency services has been a little over $3.2 million in that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| And then this shows just charts to show you the increases that has occurred from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5543)|
| 1:32:37| So with that number right there, obviously that doesn't pay for fire and rescue protection throughout the county because this is a big county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5557)|
| 1:32:46| There's a number of stations and a whole lot of personnel and apparatus and stuff has to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| So the funding models have evolved throughout the years here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5572)|
| 1:33:00| Rural Metro has been a subscription-based service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| so they go out and they try to get businesses and homeowners to pay subscriptions based upon square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| That's a voluntary process, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| And if they don't subscribe, they come regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| They don't look to see who's a subscriber or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| but then there is bills sent after the incident to help them recover their cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| Karnes used to be a volunteer donation base just like Seymour is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| but they've had to change over to this subscription model as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| So they do that to raise their funding in their community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| The challenge with the subscription model, and we'll show you a little bit more of it here in a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| is the fact that regardless if there's ever a call in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| regardless if there's ever a house fire or a heart attack or heavy rescue equipment or flooding or whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5634)|
| 1:34:02| all the infrastructure has to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| So you have to have stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| You have to have equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| You have to have training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| You have to have people that are qualified to respond at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| And as this county becomes more urbanized in lots of the areas, those demands increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| And I'll show you here how that lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| So this right here is on, actually goes back, I think, to page 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5667)|
| 1:34:37| It shows by each of the districts, the station districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| a breakdown of commercial, industrial, residential and agriculture and the other number of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| as well as the percent subscribed within those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| And just like I mentioned with the volunteers, those numbers vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| So do the subscriptions based upon who is paid during that particular month or year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| So these are a snapshot based upon when we receive the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| Now, I did include Seymour in this, but they're not a subscription-based department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| They're donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| So we try to take and to plot where their donations had come from for that time period as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| just to show you the people that are directly contributing the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| So all in all, this slide here shows the countywide subscription rate of the buildings in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5727)|
| 1:35:40| and parcels, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| So you have about 37 percent of the commercial properties, about a quarter of the industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| Forty-one percent residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| Agriculture is actually the highest amongst those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| And then the other classification is at 55 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| So roughly about half the people in the county pay for the services for everybody to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5762)|
| 1:36:10| So to get down to that, this is a very quick, high-level overview of all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| So I know that you'll have additional questions later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| But looking at some of the infrastructure here, the recommendations are one of the biggest needs is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5780)|
| 1:36:28| there's a need for training facilities here in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| and that applies both to the rescue squad, fire departments, but also to the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| So this is an opportunity that I recommend that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| and the city try to work together to develop a new, state-of-the-art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| centralized training facility that all the agencies in the county can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| This is something that I know that the city has been looking at for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| has had a hard time finding land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| So this may be an opportunity that the county could be able to help in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5823)|
| 1:37:11| Fire stations are needed to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Right now, rural metro only owns three of their stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| They lease the rest of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| There are stations that are leased that are old or inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| They need to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Some of them probably need to be moved a little bit to a better location when that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| Seymour needs a station in their Station 2 area that's there off of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| that would be able to be more suitable for staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Karn Station 1 that's there right there off of Oak Ridge Highway, that was their original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5862)|
| 1:37:53| It is old, and it is not really built for the staffing that they have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| as well as the size of the apparatus that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| So that needs to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Then the station in the Solway area needs to be either replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| or upgraded to meet the growing needs of staffing in that community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| The rescue headquarters also is 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| They definitely have outgrown that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| and we do recommend a new facility to be constructed in a more centralized location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| I would recommend that the county look at a couple of places in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| If you take that on, Rutherford County Special Operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| and Sunridge County Emergency Management both have facilities, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| that would work really well for that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| So apparatus, if you go back into the report, there's a detail of each of the apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Basically, the rolling stock in the county, for the most part, is pretty old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| without going back into the actual years and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| But apparatus is something that is a challenge because those trucks are really expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| and to have as many stations as we have in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| you're looking at replacing probably two to three fire trucks a year every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| And that's something that a lot of places have struggled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| because it's easy to kind of kick that can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| But at some point, the age of the apparatus, the reliability of the trucks and stuff will start to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| And, of course, the prices go up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| So the longer we wait, the more that they do cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| We do recommend additional staff as well as far as they have other trucks as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| that need to be replaced on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| So staffing, there's about 50 people on duty every single day outside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| for a population of about 250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| You equate those numbers and you compare that to the National Fire Protection Association statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| for a population of 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| That's about one rescue and fire personnel per every 5,500 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| The NFPA, which is not a recommendation, this is just a study of light communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6013)|
| 1:40:22| has about 7.59 personnel per 5,500 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| So the staffing as a whole is significantly lower throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| and that can create problems when we don't have the availability of the reserve personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| or off-duty folks or volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| And you have to look at what's on duty for that reliability factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| and then if you have the additional volunteers and reserves and part-time folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| then that obviously helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| But at times, those just aren't available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| I also would recommend that staffing be placed in Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| so that they have 24-hour coverage in the south end of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| as well as the Carn Station and the Solway community will need to start transitioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| from a completely volunteer to some staffing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| So the department organizations are, we have two not-for-profit fire departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| one not-for-profit rescue squad, one for-profit corporate fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6086)|
| 1:41:33| That creates some challenges at times because these are all, they have different chiefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| they have different boards, they have different personalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| just as it becomes a challenge for coordination of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| So one thing that I would recommend that the counties start looking toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| is a systems approach in regards to fire and rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| and that would be a transitional model from the current systems that you have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| into a governmental function of providing fire and rescue services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| And that can be done in several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| You can create kind of an umbrella organization and do contracts with existing agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6133)|
| 1:42:22| Those contracts can specify things like staffing levels and services provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| and certain performance criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Contracts are a challenge, as you know, to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| and make sure that everybody meets the letter of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| Another option and something that more places are transitioning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| is to where you take one or two of the existing fire departments that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| and then they just come under and become the functional part of the county response mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| and then you contract with the existing departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| I live in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| My county, Rutherford County, actually is in that process now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| to where about half of the county is provided by Rutherford County Fire Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| and the other half is provided by contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| and then over time that continues to those agencies come in underneath the county's umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6189)|
| 1:43:17| And then lastly would be the full absorption of all the fire and rescue services in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6197)|
| 1:43:28| So looking at the rescue side and special operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| and, of course, this is very timely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| considering everything that the county's been through this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| KVRS has done a tremendous job over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| but they, like all volunteer agencies, do struggle with sustaining the personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| and so they have a tremendous amount of equipment and inventory out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| We talked about the funding already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| They've received about $2.4 million from the county since 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| So one of the things to look at this and to take this on as a systems approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| would be to continue to have the fire departments increase their vehicle extrication capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| So the model that they have now, in addition to some of the engine companies running as rescue pumpers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6254)|
| 1:44:22| with people trained as vehicle extrication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| that gets that vehicle extrication out there in the community immediately at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6265)|
| 1:44:33| The functional consolidation of rescue services so that city, county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| and the fire departments all work together in a systems approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| to where there could be interlocal agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| The moving of the agency under the Knox County Emergency Management Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| with an additional, basically, a director or a rescue chief would be my recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| to head up that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| And this way you've got the city of Knoxville, Knox County Emergency Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| and the fire departments, and whether that's the independent departments we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| or Knox County Fire Rescue, all working together, sharing personnel, sharing programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| and having a lot of redundancy in the system to be able to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6317)|
| 1:45:27| Funding is one of the biggest challenges that I see to all of this, as most governmental services are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6327)|
| 1:45:34| As I pointed out here, less than about half of the people in Knox County pay for the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| while everybody benefits from good ISO ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| and obviously a lot of folks that respond very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| So one of the things that the most fair way would be to look at fire tax districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| which would be added onto the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| It goes into a dedicated revenue stream for fire and rescue services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| so it couldn't be used by other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| and the rate would be set each year based upon the needs to pay for fire and rescue services in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6365)|
| 1:46:13| It's the simplest way to collect that revenue, and at that point, everyone pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| Those that are paying subscriptions now would be paying less in fire tax districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| and everyone contributes, and you can also be able to provide the services countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| When you talk about fire tax districts and adding the taxation onto the property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| you said you could use it for other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| Are you talking other emergency services such as the sheriff's department and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| No. I'm sorry. I may have misspoke there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| It is a dedicated revenue stream for fire and rescue services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| so no other services such as the sheriff or the library or anyone else would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| It goes into a restricted account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| So in summary, the projected growth over the next 20 years is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| You're looking at over 550,000 residents in the county as a whole, probably closer to the 600,000 mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6427)|
| 1:47:14| and that's going to put additional strains on the infrastructure and the services that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6434)|
| 1:47:23| In 1980, 56% of the people had a municipal fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| but now it's closer to 42% that are provided services by a municipal department in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6450)|
| 1:47:40| We do recommend that the county become much more involved than what they have been in the past in helping with that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| A good place would be to start helping to place the training center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| and to putting fire stations where they need to be for the updates and upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| We talked about the challenges with subscriptions and user fees and donation-based funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| and the fire tax district would definitely be the way that I would recommend to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| There's a lot of stuff in here, and as with any change, there's always going to be folks that are for it and against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| and the thing to remember is that this isn't talking about getting rid of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| If you're a volunteer or a paid person or whatever else, you're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| So where you report, where the accountability is, that may change over time in the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| but the people that work in this county that provide these services, they're needed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| So I guess with that, that's a very, very, very brief overview of something that took quite some time to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| So if you have any clarifications, I'd be happy to help you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| Thank you. I see Commissioner Gill has a light on, and then I see Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| Thank you. We appreciate the amount of detailed work associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| When you statistically said that less than half the county pays for fire services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| is it included in the breakdown of that by area in terms of their payment? Is it included in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| Yeah. What we did is we took, and to get the percentages, we took each of the fire districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| and then did that on a rate of 100 so that it doesn't look like Corrington, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| their numbers are going to be lower, but their percentages on the rates. That's how that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Kevin, did you have one of your associates from County Technical Assistance Service with you here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| Why don't you have him stand up and be recognized since he did have to come from Chattanooga to be here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| Well, this is Gary Hayes. He's our director of field services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| so he's checking to make sure that I'm working and doing my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| And so he pops in every now and then on me, so I appreciate him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| And he helps wrangle all of us across the state, so he's got quite a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| Well, we appreciate you bringing the big dog here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Yeah. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| Commissioner Bussler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a couple of quick questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| You were talking about the trucks and how often they are taken out of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| Or is it with age or mileage that causes a truck to have to be taken out of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| That can vary. There's there's standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| The National Fire Protection Association does set standards as far as recommended age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| It doesn't really go into mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| The apparatus in Knox County do have a lot higher mileage, but there's a lot of calls in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| and they have a lot of territory to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| So they do a pretty incredible job with maintaining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| But when you take a fire truck and you're running 20,000 calls across the county year in and year out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| it definitely does make a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| Most places look at replacing their apparatus engines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| It used to be people would look at 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| But now with the volumes, especially with EMS responses and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| a lot of jurisdictions that I see are looking at probably 15 years or less on the replacement of their apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| The second question here is the vehicles that are taken out of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| I see some really rural areas that kind of pick those trucks up because they don't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| Is there a problem redoing those trucks because of the lack of parts to repair them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6689)|
| 1:51:38| You know, when they get passed down to the rural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| you're taking a truck that's running a couple thousand calls a year to maybe a hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| So it does, you know, it's a lot better than what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| As far as the repair goes, I would assume most of the parts are still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| There's some things become obsolete, and obviously at that point they would have to completely not be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| Yeah. Okay. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| And then the last thing about the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| the way the difference of having the fire service and not having for homeowners insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6725)|
| 1:52:13| Mine is a, what I save on my homeowners insurance and what I pay for the rural metro service I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6733)|
| 1:52:23| to me is about $150 savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| Chief Harnish, that doesn't mean you raise my rates, but it does save me money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| So if the people really look into it, your insurance, if you're within that, I guess what, is it a zone three, four, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| I know they go by zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| That helps you the most in the insurance cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| Yeah. And there's a section here about ISO, just kind of a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Basically, the three departments have different ratings, and rural metro and Seymour have a split rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6771)|
| 1:52:59| which means that if you're within 1,000 feet of a hydrant and five miles of a station, you get a better rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| If you're beyond 1,000 feet, then it's a different rating, and Carnes has a straight rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| So their ISO rating is the same, just as long as they're within five miles of a station, whether they have a hydrant or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Oh, and I like that part in the book here that shows where the hydrants are located at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| That's the brown one on the brown, I guess, the page that has all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| Yeah, those are 1,000-foot circles around those hydrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| So there is an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| We just didn't have the data from part of the utility districts because of them being independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| But hopefully that will help a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| And, Gary, this is the first time in five years I've seen Kevin here, and I'm just teasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| Please don't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| This is an exceptional amount of information to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| Where will this study be available for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| So I will give a PDF copy to the commission, and then that way you all can release it however you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6845)|
| 1:54:15| You may want to put it on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| We don't post our reports on our website, so that would be up to you all to determine what you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| This is a study that this commission asked to have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| In my experience, government is exceptional about asking for a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| and then doing virtually nothing with the study they've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| What is our follow-up, and what is the plan to at least continue the dialogue beyond tonight, or is there one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| I think that's up to this body to determine exactly how we want to use this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| It is something that we have requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| I think that the public welfare requires us to give this some additional due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| and to make sure the public has access to this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| I would encourage my fellow commissioners to process it, absorb it, understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| and then continue the dialogue in some time that keeps it top of mind versus sitting on a shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Thank you, Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| I guess my question is on the fire tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| Rural Metro, I believe, is a for-profit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| Seymour and Carnes are basically surviving as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| How would that fire tax district work with the for-profit against non-profits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6935)|
| 1:55:43| The way that I would envision it working would be that the county would negotiate based upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| with each of the agencies, if you left them as they are now, what it's going to take to provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| And then that's assessed, and then it's just a contractual arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| Here's the services they provide, and this is what you're going to pay them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| So it wouldn't vary, and there would be some stability in that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| Any follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Again, Kevin, thank you for the work that you've put into this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| It's been an issue that I've been concerned with for three or four years at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| So in answer to Larson's question, Commissioner J.'s question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| the mayor and I have already met with Kevin on the preliminary look at the report before it was completely finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| We have met and had the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| After the budget's approved and we get into the summer, we're going to continue that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| And hopefully Kevin can come back on an as-needed basis to discuss options and implementations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7000)|
| 1:56:50| And so the best time to get Kevin here, though, is during basketball season when there's a home game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| So we'll try to get him here in the fall and get this process really rolling because this is critical to our future as we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7015)|
| 1:57:06| I mean, South Knoxville at times has zero coverage for fire service, and we need to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| And so, you know, with Karnes, it has come light years in the last five years, new equipment, new fire halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7033)|
| 1:57:21| but they can't sustain their momentum with the current funding and the 50 percent subscription rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| So we've got to do something about this as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| It's going to take some political courage, but we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| And so I thank you guys for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| And, Kevin, again, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| This concludes this part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| I want to manage expectations for all of our guests and my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| At 7 p.m., that is when we have public notice and we'll conduct our zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7068)|
| 1:57:56| My plan is we will take a look at the next item on the agenda to begin moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| But based on past meetings like this, we will probably proceed with the go immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| We will put this meeting in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| We will commence with the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| After the zoning meeting, we'll take a brief, probably ten-minute break and take a brief break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7093)|
| 1:58:23| and then get back to the regular part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| So with that said, Madam Clerk, what's the next item on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| It's item number two, consideration of the closure of a portion of South National Drive between Federal Road and North National Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders and a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| If that motion is properly before us, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| I recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the line item transfers number one through page nine as listed in our agenda package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7144)|

| 2:05:34| Dr. Buchanan, Martha, while you're here, where is Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| Could you please approach the ‑‑ she had just expressed a similar interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| Dr. Buchanan, what was that item number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| It is the discussion item about AMR and BLS, Commissioner Bussler's item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| All right, Commissioner Bussler had expressed interest in that particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| and while Dr. Buchanan is here, Commissioner Bussler, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| No, it will be a short two or three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| Okay, I'll go ahead and call on Commissioner Bussler just so we can take care of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| Okay, I saw in the paper where the ambulances we're using are BLSs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| and if you could, please, could you describe to me the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| between a basic life support ambulance and an advanced life support ALS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| I have to open a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| So taken directly from the contract, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| the definition of a BLS ambulance is basic life support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7593)|
| 2:06:41| The treatment of life‑threatening medical emergencies by an emergency medical technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| or other qualified and licensed medical and nursing personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| qualified through the use of such techniques as patient assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, splinting, obstetrical assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| bandaging, administration of oxygen, application of pneumonic antishock trousers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| and other techniques described in the basic advanced emergency medical technician curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| or otherwise approved by the county pursuant to the laws of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| So those are set by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Those definitions are set by the state and contained in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| And I apologize, I don't have the definition of ALS in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| but Chris Blotch was here from AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| I'm not going to hold you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| But the other thing, you have two basic life support ambulance services on our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7647)|
| 2:07:33| But going on a little bit farther, how many basic life support ambulances and ALSs are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7653)|
| 2:07:41| I need Mr. Blotch, who was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Who must have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| So I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Okay, we'll just move this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| Okay, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Mr. Blotch would know the number of ambulances, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=7669)|

| 2:19:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| And thank you to the committee for coming together to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| I know we had, I guess, some sickness and we were able to get that done this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| So thank you to the Insolvency Committee for getting that done today so we can vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| Item 804 is approving contracts with Lassen Impressions Lawn Care and KMF3 Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| to provide mowing and general grounds and maintenance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| The motion for approval is from Commissioner Gill and there's a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| Discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| I see Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Last week, whenever we spoke about this, I brought it to the attention, the amount of cuts that were going to be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| and things of that nature, the cut cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| And then we talked about inmate services, maybe taking over some of the duties and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8397)|
| 2:20:04| I've done a little bit of homework, I guess you could say, over the past week and looked a little bit further into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| and come to find out that inmate services has given over 100,000 man hours last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| Not only that, there were some nonprofits that they did some work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| and they also have some work that they've done throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| There was some liability talk about cutting grass and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| I've come to find out they are cutting grass in different locations already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| They already have the equipment, the trailers, the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| But with the great help of Matt Myers, we actually came to a pretty good little agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| and we're scaling back on some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| So if Mr. Myers could come to the podium for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| because I don't think there's any more representation from the Sheriff's Office for me to ask them any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| So I'll ask him if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| Go ahead, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| So earlier last week, whenever we spoke, we talked about the cutting cycle was every five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| That means in a 30-day month that the grass would be cut six times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| We talked about the dollar rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| We talked about how much of a basically what we expected out of the services for the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| the senior centers, as well as the health departments and the convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| If you don't care to just briefly give a little overview statement of everything that we have kind of accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| over the past week for the other members of the commission, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| We went back and looked at the contracts, and they did say every five business days, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8490)|
| 2:21:39| you could say might be excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| We do want them to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| We want our facilities to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| So we did go to the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| They agreed to go to a seven-day cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| And I also want to stress that, you know, based on weather, whether it's, you know, wet or dry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8509)|
| 2:21:55| doesn't mean we're going to cut each and every time that seven-day or 14-day comes up for the convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| You know, I know the library maintenance person, Cody Miller, does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| They don't need cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| He's not going to ask them to cut just because that's what we said we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| So we have scaled back on that, and I think we've made good progress on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| Thank you, and I appreciate all your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| And I appreciate everybody that, you know, looked into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| I know that it took a few man hours for everybody to really come together and put their heads together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| And thanks for making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| I know that we're going to save some significant money on these contracts by scaling back by just a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8555)|
| 2:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8559)|
| 2:22:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| We appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| And, as always, we look forward to dealing with minority vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| Were they receptive to the suggestion from five to seven days to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| And I know the nature of government looking at, obviously, the weather impacts the level of yard cutting that will impact how they are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8573)|
| 2:23:06| And what were their thoughts associated with it as we came back to deal with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| We have two contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| One of them is a minority DBE, and they were both very receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| They both want to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| They want to know that the contract is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| We're not waiting 30 days to see if it's going to happen or not, if we're going to bring it inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| So now they have, you know, they can go get their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| They can go hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| They can be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| You know, if we get a few more sunny days, I'm cutting my grass, and I know they'll be ready, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| So they were receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| It's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| So is the contract we're looking at today the only change from the contract we looked at last week is the amount of days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8623)|
| 2:23:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Is that the only changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| So is there any changes to this current contract as it relates to inmate industries supplementing any of the work that they would normally be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8634)|
| 2:24:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| There's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| They're not really a part of these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| These are with my two contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| So this is just a change in days of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| I just wanted to clarify that because I was just a little confused as to combining the conversation about inmate industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| and this contract, if they were doing work that this contract would have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| But this is just a straight day adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8665)|
| 2:24:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| I recognize Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| I think where you might be confused is at first I wanted inmate industries to look further into doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| and then there was some talks about liability, and then I recognized that they already cut other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| because I was looking into what would keep them from mowing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| and actually doing it in-house to save us that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| But instead I realized that specific businesses that are involved would do an amazing job at doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| if we just scaled back on some of the number of days and it would save us money in the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| and having that third-party business that everybody on commission spoke of doing it instead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| For that clarification, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| Just to follow up on Commissioner Biggs, I use the inmate labor at a couple, two, three spots that mow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| If we start adding on to them, you're going to have to come up with new lawn mowers, new trailers, new trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| everything, because their equipment is running down big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| So I just wanted to ñ and they do a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| And when mowing season comes, they light the dark all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| That's warranting any additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8749)|
| 2:25:50| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| Item number 44, Resolution 902, is approving the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated Subsection 8-21-1001J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8751)|

| 2:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| Could I get a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| We have a motion to approve from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| Rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| Well, I will say this is one that will require a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| So get that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| But first, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Do we know, was this not previously charged by the Register of Deeds Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8797)|
| 2:26:46| Even though it was in Tennessee Code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| Is there anybody from the Register of Deeds Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| Not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| I see Commissioner Baylor's light up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| Commissioner Baylor, this is your new bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Well, the issue is that e-filings have not previously been done by the Register's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| And so there is a $2 per document fee that the Register charges for all documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| But the General Assembly has passed legislation to allow for an additional $2 to be charged for any e-file documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8826)|
| 2:27:16| And this is an opportunity to generate revenue that could offset any costs for firewalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| and things like that that IT might incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| So we just, under the new administration of the Register of Deeds Office, started electronic filing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8847)|
| 2:27:33| Well, Knox County had just never done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| It's relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| And we just didn't have the software to do it in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| But we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8863)|
| 2:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8866)|
| 2:27:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| Could you just help me understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| So the electronic submission fee, so you pay the $2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| And that money is allocated or dedicated in a separate account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| or this is just additional revenue being generated solely for the purpose of the electronic documentation of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8883)|
| 2:28:12| It's solely for the electronic documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| There's a recording fee that's paid for all documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| But this is just an additional $2 for electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| And it will not be earmarked for the Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| It will go to the general fund for the county to use for any IT charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8906)|
| 2:28:27| That's where I was going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| It just requires a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| We'll go ahead and I'll allow the clerk's office to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| We'll be starting in District 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8923)|

| 2:29:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| Resolution 906 is approving an appropriation in an amount to be determined from the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8970)|
| 2:29:39| fund balance for Knox County Planning to begin development of updating the county growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| and general plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| We discussed this one extensively at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| I know there was a general consensus to change the verbiage on this from whether, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| frankly we don't have an exact amount to appropriate, but there was a lot of discussion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| postponed to tonight to define exactly what type of resolution that we'd like to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| I know there's some folks who have expressed an interest in speaking at public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| I also recognize that we have two commissioner lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| I'll wait until they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9019)|
| 2:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9020)|
| 2:30:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9021)|
| 2:30:22| I see Commissioner Smith's light is lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9022)|
| 2:30:25| Mr. Davis has approached the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Do you wish to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| Are you going to go behind the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Well, I also want to say is I did have one other person sign up for public forum before you did, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| So if you'd like, I'd like to give them out of politeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| I'd like to go ahead and grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| Go ahead, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| I'm Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| And unfortunately, I was unable to be here at last month's meeting, but I did go back and watch it on video two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9052)|
| 2:30:59| It starts at 130 and goes on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| And the meeting started off with Mayor Jacobs articulating what I thought was a very subsequent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9062)|
| 2:31:08| good, laid out reason why the growth policy plan needs to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| And after I watched the rest of the meeting, I was more confused than I was before it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| And as I watched it a third time, I realized that there's a lot of confusion between the general plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9082)|
| 2:31:30| And I can't imagine why, because we have a general plan, a growth policy plan, an urban growth plan, a rural growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| a planned growth area, sector plans, one-year plans, hillside and protection plans, parental responsibility zone plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9095)|
| 2:31:42| technology corridor overlay plans, planned commercial, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| I can't imagine why or how anybody would be confused by all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| But the general plan and the growth policy plan are completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9110)|
| 2:31:57| One has nothing to do with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| The growth policy plan that was enacted in 2000 was done for a multitude of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| but primarily was to address forced annexation, eliminate annexation or incorporation out of fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9124)|
| 2:32:12| establish incentives to annex or incorporate areas where appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| and more closely watch the timing of development and the provision of public services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| As you all know, the state legislature in 2014 did away with forced annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9139)|
| 2:32:24| Therefore, the necessity for the growth policy plan was negated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9144)|
| 2:32:31| Also, you have to go back to 2000 when county commission voted on the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| County commission voted not to put a plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9156)|
| 2:32:42| Tommy Schumpert, the county executive at the time, put forth a plan that had 12 square miles to be included in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9162)|
| 2:32:50| The city of Farragut submitted one mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| The city of Knoxville submitted 36 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| They came back and renegotiated and I think came up with 23 square miles or 26 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| It was part of the urban growth boundary, of which you have the growth policy area and the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9182)|
| 2:33:10| of which it came by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| Everything that was not part of the urban growth boundary or the planned growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| automatically became part of the rural area, of which that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| which is all of the remaining part of Knox County excluding the 23 or 26 acres they agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| was to be set up for territory not within one of the other two categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9210)|
| 2:33:35| which is to be preserved for agricultural, recreation, forest, wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| and businesses other than high-density commercial or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| So by default, the vast majority of the undeveloped land in Knox County became unusable for low-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9223)|
| 2:33:51| or medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| And that plan has not been reviewed since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| As you all know, Knox County has changed quite a bit since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| This plan was set up to see what growth was going to be going forward for the next 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| and it has not been amended and or changed, but the necessity for it is no longer relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9247)|
| 2:34:12| I mean, we cannot have forest annexations anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| and so therefore the original impetus for the growth policy plan is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9256)|
| 2:34:22| The general plan covers Knox County as well as the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9262)|
| 2:34:28| There is no detrimental at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| There's no detrimental to Knox County to do away with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| We have the general plans to cover it, we have the sector plans to cover it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| and then every development we do is also a planned commercial or planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9280)|
| 2:34:47| We are planned to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| And to think that someone's not confused with 12 different plans out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| I understand why there was so much confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| But you all really, I'm going to respectfully request that you all go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| and watch again what Mayor Jacobs presented and listen to what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9301)|
| 2:35:06| He articulated a very good argument why this body should request that the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| go back and review whether or not the growth policy plan is one, enforceable, two, necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9313)|
| 2:35:19| and three, accomplishes what it needs to because it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| And it creates so much confusion with the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| and conflict between you all and MPC, which doesn't help anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| And again, I appreciate you all's time and service in what you all do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| and I don't do this very often, but I'm going to use the other side's tactic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9334)|
| 2:35:39| but all those folks here that are in favor of amending or abolishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| or doing away with the growth policy plan, would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9342)|
| 2:35:48| These are folks that generate revenue, build houses, create opportunity in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| and this affects our livelihood. Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| I had one other person express interest to speak on this, and that was Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9360)|
| 2:36:09| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| I'm here representing Hardin Valley Planning Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| French Broad Preservation Association, Northeast Knox Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| North Shore Corridor Association, and Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9381)|
| 2:36:25| There's a number of representatives here. I'd like everybody that's here to please take a quick stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| So these are a lot of the community folks. Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| Thank you all that are involved and are the leaders of these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| One thing we did as we were having the discussion earlier about all the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| and the need to do some assessments, we will be happy on the community pages that we run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| when we post those notices up to tell folks to call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| That's something that we can do, and we're happy to help amplify that message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| to help out the county and the city in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| All of us would like to thank you, all of you, for supporting the need for good planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| and recognizing that we do need to update our plans to provide directions for all parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| for our utilities, our schools, transportation organizations, development, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9429)|
| 2:37:16| We listened and watched the workshop, and we certainly all support the idea of amending the resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9436)|
| 2:37:23| currently up and just asking planning to start working with purchasing to figure out scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9443)|
| 2:37:30| and approach of how they'd actually go engage a party to do the updates for the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| and the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| Probably to help this, in short, maybe tonight's discussion some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| probably helpful if planning is allowed to do a little bit of research after they kick off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| and then do an educational workshop for all commissioners and the public to get us all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9468)|
| 2:37:57| because there's vocabulary that's difficult, understanding what the state law says must be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9477)|
| 2:38:04| for both the growth policy plan and the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| and then allowing the commission to give some feedback to planning on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| this is sort of how we'd like to see this process, scope and approach work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| And there was a lot of confusion last month at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| It's a difficult topic, and I think we'll all benefit if the planning group staff can actually facilitate that workshop for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9500)|
| 2:38:30| I do think, and it is, that was quickly glossed over, the growth policy plan and the general plan are intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9510)|
| 2:38:37| There's a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Maybe it's no longer legally binding from the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| but there's a lot of information that talks about density, and it does specify if there's rural areas there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| and that does flow down into the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| So I think it's important that planning have the opportunity to figure out the right approach for updating both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9531)|
| 2:38:58| But the growth policy plan, it's the really big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| It says urban, planned growth, rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| That's the big picture thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| The general plan takes that and builds it in another level deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| But the growth policy plan, it ties together the cities, schools, transportation, the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| all those who aren't necessarily involved in the things that are in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9558)|
| 2:39:24| So finally, we'd encourage you to speak with the planning staff as individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| as you have things you want them to consider in terms of how the planning process is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9569)|
| 2:39:34| Things like, you know, Commissioner Bussler, you had some great ideas about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| that you want it to be done in small community type plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| That's really effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| That's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9583)|
| 2:39:44| So I think that's something the planning staff needs to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| In conclusion, thanks for your time on this and for starting to work on updating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| My last point says to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| That was funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| What we'll do discussion-wise, I recognize I think Commissioner Anders' light was the first on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| and then Commissioner Bussler both wanted to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| I'll go ahead and recognize Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| I think it's important that we all, I think we're all in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| We want to, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| I think it's important that we all, we all are on the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| We need plans, long-term plans, and our plan needs to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| But I think with the things going on in the legislature right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| there's a bill currently in legislature talking about the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| the state-mandated growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| So I'm going to make a motion to put this off for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9640)|
| 2:40:52| Number one, planning NOCs is coming out of recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| or in the introduction to the city council to recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| and that's probably not going to be very short-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| There is a lot of work going on, and if the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| if we plan on a scope of work and pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| and the legislature says, well, you don't need this, you need that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| then we've paid for something we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| And so I'm going to make a motion that we postpone this until the end of the legislative session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| and establish our, and then also Mayor Jacobs is also coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| and trying to get together with, sent the letter out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| to get the growth policy plan review back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| So we're actually putting the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| and so I want to make sure that we set this off until the July meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| to set a scope of work, figure out what legislation is done, and revisit it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9696)|
| 2:41:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| Okay, there's a motion from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| We'll continue discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| So Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| He's still got his line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9713)|
| 2:41:54| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9714)|
| 2:41:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9716)|
| 2:41:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| Let me ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| The urban growth boundary plans that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| does that not come in sunset pretty soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9725)|
| 2:42:12| There's a possibility that it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| It depends what, it's kind of what Commissioner Anders stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| There is a bill to extend it another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| So it may or it may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| It depends on what state legislature does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| But it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| Okay, what you have right now is you have two things that's before the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9748)|
| 2:42:33| One has to do with the date of 2000, and the other one is 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9753)|
| 2:42:38| And both of those affects our growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| What we're planning with right now, as you look back at 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| when we finally finalized this growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| it looks like nothing that we did in that growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| It was dictated by what the people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| And a lot of people are wanting different things now than what we are structuring now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9778)|
| 2:43:06| And we really don't have what we need for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| is the communities like to develop in communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| They don't like to deal with cities anymore or counties or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| They're moving out of the way, and they have their little pods that they like to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9799)|
| 2:43:24| So the public, this community that we're living in, will be in this area here, and we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9804)|
| 2:43:31| And now just right across the road or someplace else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| there could be another community development that has their idea of what they want to live in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| Instead of us dictating what they must do or where they must go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9820)|
| 2:43:45| because the community and the citizens will tell everybody, even the developers, what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| Because the developers are not going to build something that they won't buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| So my question is, let's stop somewhere along the line and tell our legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9837)|
| 2:44:04| let it sunset to where we can start working on what the public wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9844)|
| 2:44:09| and not what we perceive that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| So that's my point, but we've got two legislators that want to extend it for another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| I think we should put more emphasis with what we're voted in here to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| is have them to speak to us and let them tell us what they need and what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| So whatever you want to do, that's fine, but you've got two bills before you have to state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| It could make it another 20 years before you can really decide how you all want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| That's up to you to tell your state legislators what you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9878)|
| 2:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9883)|
