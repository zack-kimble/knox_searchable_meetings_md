| 0:01:53| Okay, we have a quorum. Is there a motion to approve the minutes of May 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Any discussion? We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| Are there any items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| Yes. We have an item at, let's see, sorry about that, 12H, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=135)|
| 0:02:27| 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| 12F, one of the letters. No, yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Please slow down your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| So this agenda item should have gone to public property naming committee before it came to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=156)|
| 0:02:44| So my initial plan was to recommend a postponement until July 13th to allow us to have time to have that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=164)|
| 0:02:54| That will give you enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Hopefully that's the plan. I've talked to Will about going ahead and trying to get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| The other thing is we could also discuss it because there are folks here about the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=183)|
| 0:03:13| I'm open to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| Well, I think it would be, unless there's objection from council, we can vote to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| but let's do address it because the family members are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| And if you all don't object, we'll go ahead and just address the ordinance change briefly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| I would like to recognize Pastor Davis's wife who's in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| and also First Lady Pastor Evans' wife and also one of the members from the Eternal Life Harvest Church family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you, ladies, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| We are very excited about this particular item being on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| that will be going before the Street Naming Convention Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| for all of the good work that Pastor Davis did in our community and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Just for anybody tuning in here, this is an ordinance to change the street name of Brandau Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| between Knoxville College and Monroe Center Street to James Davis Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| in honor of Pastor James Davis, who unfortunately has passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| but will be remembered in many ways, including by this street change name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| So we apologize that you were here and were not able to act on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| It's kind of a glitch in our system, which we need to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| We'll work with MPC and council to figure this out so this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| But in the meantime, you've made a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| So will we still discuss it or have any discussion when we get to that point in the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| No, we will just postpone it now so then the family is free to stay or to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| But the item will now be postponed with this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| So we have a motion, and it will come back on this agenda July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| Yeah, my motion is to postpone for six weeks until the July 13th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=310)|

| 0:05:58| For the Mayor's Report, first I want to remind council members that the statewide conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| for the Tennessee Municipal League will be held at the Nostel Convention Center this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| weekend from Saturday, June 9th to Tuesday morning, June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| TML, as you all know, is our state association of towns and cities which works to promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| city issues and interests across Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| They're especially important for us in working with the governor and the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| We work very closely with them and their government representatives, their lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| The annual conference rotates to different cities and this year it's Knoxville's turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| to host them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| So more than 300 municipal officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| There'll be mayors, city council members, and staff from across the state who will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| And so we're excited to have them in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Hopefully we'll spend a lot of their money while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| So of course y'all are all encouraged to attend and if you haven't already registered you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=415)|

| 0:11:52| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I just have a few comments to make on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| This is not a fixed and final of each and every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Each project will be coming in front of the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| But I do want to go ahead and make a comment just to introduce the idea about the $36 million for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| I have a lot of fiscal concerns about that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| I know that the police headquarters, they need a new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and I know the fire department, we've been renting space or leasing space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| What I would like to see is if we can do some more research, if there's a way, if there's a building that already exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| maybe East Town Mall, something, you know, the most green building is one that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| So I'm just introducing that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=765)|

| 0:14:29| Here he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| He's right on cue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| He knew you'd want to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| We talked yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| So, Jim, convince me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| We have a surplus in our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| We're looming of multiple projects of close to $70 million that we're working on and approving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| including this $17 million for the streetlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Why not pay this out of our general fund since we have a surplus there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| What's the logic and how did you make that recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| One of the things that we always evaluate in any of these is what kind of debt we will be taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| versus spend down of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| There are many reasons why we are recommending that this be debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| The first is that what you have is you have two funds that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| One, currently we pay for street lighting expenses out of the state street aid fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| That is a fund that is restricted as to the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| And our intention is to use that, use the savings that we capture in that fund to help pay down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=948)|
| 0:15:59| If we were to basically put general fund balance into that to pay for the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=959)|
| 0:16:08| we would be somewhat handicapped in using those restricted funds to help pay off for those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=968)|
| 0:16:18| The other thing is that what you have here is a case where you have payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=978)|
| 0:16:29| that will be made for the bonds over an eight to ten year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| You will have savings that are captured over that same period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| That's basically the prime consideration for doing this through debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| That's fairly standard practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| You like to mirror your cash flow on the debt to the cash flow on any revenues that you might receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| In this case, it's not revenues, but savings in the form of energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| So that's the primary reason for doing this as debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| The other reason, and again, this will probably be more important if we do another bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| is that we have to weigh, again, the proportion of debt to the use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| There is a preference by the bond rating agencies to incur debt rather than draw down your fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| They view fund balance as being much more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Again, you can use that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| And so there's a preference in their ratings to issuing debt rather than utilizing fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1055)|
| 0:17:45| Again, but we'll be working on any future bond issues to try and determine what the best composition is to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1065)|
| 0:17:55| But this one is pretty cut and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| This is a textbook case of where you want to borrow the money, pay it back as you capture the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| Mainly because of those restricted funds in that fund balance in the state, as you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| So we're picking up assets with this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| I mean, we're getting assets from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| We're getting assets, two assets in the form of basically we purchased some assets from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| That includes poles, arms, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| We will also be capturing assets in the form of replacement, anything that's a replacement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| So we will have assets, you know, on the city's books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| Again, we typically will never borrow for anything where we don't have any assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| That's just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| So we've got an inventory list for all that, and you've worked all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| And so there's agreements, like if a truck hits a pole that's got our light fixture on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| It would be our responsibility, and we've got agreements with KUB, and all that stuff is in place with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| So we have those things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| We're working basically to finalize some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| And council's previously approved that purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| So we're in the process of buying 29,500 or so street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| So that's a nice group of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| And some telephone poles and mass poles and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| But we will obviously, if we can find out who hits a pole, and we hope that no one hits a pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| but if that happens, then we will go through our risk management folks to try and subrogate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| and capture that from the driver's insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| And you've got a call in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| So if you're paying it back faster than you're able to pay it back faster than ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| then you can pay it off in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| You have that option, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| We have the option to pay off in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| It could run the full term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| We'll just have to assess that at the end of the eight-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Do you want to come back and advise us on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1208)|

| 0:20:17| Okay, so this has to be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1217)|

| 0:21:15| I touched base with Janet Wright about this earlier today, and she indicated there might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| be somebody here this evening from Iris who, right there, might talk just a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| I was just wondering if we could get just a little bit of background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| I get a lot of questions about fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| I'm Dave Bredes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I'm the CTO for Iris Networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Iris was started 20-odd years ago by the independent telcos in Tennessee to connect each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| They were being strangled by bigger, out-of-state telecoms to connect to each other and connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| to the outside world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| They formed Iris at that time, and we've been serving the rural communities ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Primarily, up until now, the customers that we serve are other telcos and other large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| LECs and the cellular companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| The last year and a half, we're entering the enterprise market, which is medium to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| small to large businesses, providing Internet, voice, and hopefully, down the road, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| data security services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Primarily, again, we have a statewide network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| I wish I had a map to show you, but we really do cover the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| We connect Atlanta, Chicago, and Ashburn as well to the outside world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| Is that enough detail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| No, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Thank you for that background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Primarily, your audience is the business community, not residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| The purpose is to increase the speed of data flow and access to data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| The speed and reliability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1368)|

| 0:22:54| We're more local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I think we have a more local touch than some of the other providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| We will be hiring locally, and I'm actually moving here in a week, so we really do try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| and do the local thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1386)|

| 0:25:40| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code, Chapter 18, Section 18-4 to prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| amplified sound on public rights of way and public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| So this particular agenda item I see is at the request of KPD, and I don't want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| for my colleagues here, but I get a lot of comments from folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| This particularly only pertains to public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| I get a lot of comments from people about noise and how to measure that and when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| call in noise complaints, not being able to enforce that, noise from businesses as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| move towards mixed use, people who are living close to places that have bands or generators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| from food trucks, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Can you comment on what role KPD plays in that, Chief Roush, and why we have such difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| enforcing that and how we could improve upon that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| So a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| So the challenge of enforcing the noise ordinance that you're talking about is it's about decibel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| And so the officers will come out with a device and will measure, they have to take several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| measurements at different points around the complaint area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| And at a specific distance, which is required by ordinance, and then at a specific level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| what you find is the levels, while they are legal and within the proper decibel levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| still can cause disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| And so people get upset that we can't do anything about it, but it's within the levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| And so our folks do do the, they'll come out and do the check when they're called, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| they'll report back to an individual that has called to let them know here's what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| found, here's what the law says, and so they educate as much with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| And any more, actually, there's an app for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And that you can actually pull up on your phone and measure as well to determine if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| they're within the legal standard that is in our current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| So this particular ordinance tonight that we're voting on will make the same rules that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| we already have for private property that you guys go out and measure for on public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| This is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Different decibel levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah, this is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| This is only about amplified sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Specific types of sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Specific types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Not all sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| But in your experience, most of the time, are all officers able to go out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Do they all have the device to measure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Generally, what we do as a supervisor, we'll take that on when we have a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| I just wanted to ask the law director, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| As you said, there's a noise ordinance, which is all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Covers the city, which addresses decibel levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| This is about amplified sound that currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| This is really an exception to that type of rule, and it applies only to public rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| of way to public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| And so there is not a need when there is a violation of the ordinance that is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| here, there will not be a need to come out and measure the decibels or do anything like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| that, because the amplification of the sound on the public rights of way and on the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| property, in and of itself, will be the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Councilwoman St. Corinth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| I have a lot of concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I know that I went and toured downtown and heard a lot of examples on why this is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| instigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| And it's all very benign and innocuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| I know that there have been incidents that are very annoying and a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| But to me, this is public property, and the public has a right to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| It feels like an infringement on First Amendment rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| And I think we have to deal with some annoyance in order to make sure that we have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| So what I would say is that under the First Amendment and under the power of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| we have a right to address time, place, and manner, which we do all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| So we certainly are protectors of the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| And quite frankly, we've been recognized by U.S. Congress for our efforts in allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| people to have free speech, particularly with the monument exercise that took place back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| earlier or late last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| And so I would tell you that this doesn't infringe upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| So what we're looking at doing is this is a manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| It has nothing to do with what they're saying or how they say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| This is just the manner in which they amplify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| The amplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I just get concerned about unintended consequences of having that as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| And I can tell you now, typically in our enforcement, as you're aware in our enforcement of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| our first step always is advise and warn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| And that would continue to be the case in this is we would advise a person that it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| that they can't use the device that they have and that there is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| If they want to use an amplification, they can get a permit to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| And then that makes it so they're not completely being prohibited from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| It's just they have to go through a process to be able to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| So currently this ordinance prohibits amplified sound just on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| And so we're now, I guess I want to know what the reasoning was just to make it citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| So you've gone from a really small, tight area, Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Why not just enlarge it to the confounds of downtown where you had the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| and we decided to take it all across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| That seems to be quite a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Again, all across the city and public property and public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| And so what's happened, Councilwoman, is that it's become confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| for enforcement of the ordinance for the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| specifically downtown because of the way it does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| But as we had conversation about the expansion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| and Rick may be able to expand on that, but as we have conversation about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| these things pop up in other places as well throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And so to have a consistent ordinance for officers to be able to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| that they can consistently utilize this ordinance to address this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| is the reason that it was expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| And, Rick, if you have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Hello, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I'm Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I'm the downtown coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| It came up when we tried to talk about where the boundaries may be for such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| And with, say, Bearden expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| and all the mixed-use developments we're all proponents of these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| it's hard to say, well, let's just do it in this area or the other area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| I mean, Riga Square, for instance, Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I mean, I've seen folks up there busking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| We know that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Fountain City is another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| So, you know, where do you stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| So we thought it would just be a smart idea just to go ahead right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| and ban amplification citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| That way the officers know exactly what the situation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| and everyone else does as well, under the same format that we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| You can get a permit if you need be to have amplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| But we know busking is going to occur in those other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| It's a pretty cool thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| We kind of like it, but to be amplified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| and to create some disturbance like some of these folks are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| is a problem for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| So you do have instances across the city to go back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| I mean, I guess you're seeing that, Chief and Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| I mean, you're seeing you have other complaints throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| where it's been a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I'm sure police officers get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I don't get them particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I get them as far as Happy Holler, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| I mean, I've got them that far, but I know Chief probably gets them other spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| There are other locations throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| I mean, there certainly are free speech implications to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and so I think it's very important that we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And, Mr. Emmett, maybe you can answer a couple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| that I think will be very helpful for those who are here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| and maybe those who are watching as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| But this is actually not a total ban on speech in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| It is a ban on amplification only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| but amplification is still available so long as you get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| This is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| And the permit, as my understanding costs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| if you were going to do something on a very small scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| would be very negligible or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| It's free, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| It's free, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| So there is neutrality in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| in the sense that there's no regulation on the type of speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| that is or is not being allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| It is strictly on the manner of the speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| and it's strictly regarding whether or not you can have amplification or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| and there is an alternate way of having amplification through the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| It's basically location and timing as much as anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| There are certain areas that just aren't compatible with being amplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| You're out at someone's door, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| or outside someone's business or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| and then you don't want to be at 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| So it basically covers those kinds of things is what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| And as we're, let's say, saying that this is to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| if there were any issues with the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| is there some flexibility that we could look at going forward where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| if we did need to have additional permitting that was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| we could consider that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| We're always looking to improve, so yes, no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Chief Roush, is there a decimal level that the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| I know you said there's an app and there's also a device that they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| So what is that scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I'm trying to kind of get that in my head because I know that there are some churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| that will have picnics in public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| They may use a small amplifier just so that people can hear them in a larger space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| and they play music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| So I'm trying to kind of get a feel for what that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So the decimal level won't apply on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| This is just amplified sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| So what they would need to do if they're going to have an event in a public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| is apply for a permit, and that's where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| and again, the permit doesn't have a cost to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| So they would apply for a permit and that would run through our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| and be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I mean, I don't know why we would disapprove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| There, of course, would be time constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| but if they're in a public park, the constraints are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Public parks close at sundown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| And so I guess my second concern is this is going to be something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| It's going to be a huge change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| So I'm not sure what the communication process is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| if we've even thought that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| And let's say that a church does have something in the park this Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| and they don't know about it or next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| and maybe someone calls because they don't like the fact that they're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| and they have, like, an amplified speaker there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| and the police are called, would they just be issued a warning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| because they were not aware of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| So I just want to make sure that there's some allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah, absolutely, and that would be at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| That wouldn't just be as the ordinance is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| We always, you know, as long as it's not the same person over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| warning is always the way we handle these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Okay, and is there a communication plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| As I understand, we always have a communication plan on all new ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| and so I'm sure that the information will be put out through the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| as we do on all new ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| So can you apply for that permit online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| I don't know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| I'm sure we will make it available as we do with all permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| I'll have to check and see the process itself, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| Councilman, I'm not sure right now to tell you that, but I will certainly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| it seems to me it should be a pretty simple process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| and so I'll check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| I think it would be pretty hard to come down, make a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| you know, for the situation that Councilwoman McKenzie was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| I think that, and from my knowledge right now, the way that, you know, special event permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| I know that they send those in as an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| and so I'm pretty sure that this would be something that we could do easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| Okay, but you'll look into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| I will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I guess another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Would this apply to vehicles as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Say after work, you're going home from work, roll down your windows and turn up the radio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| There's already a law for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| There's already a law that exists for that, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| You can't have sound emitting from your vehicle more than 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Might have to get that app for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| Unless it's baby lullabies for the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| Uptown hustle or something really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Okay, so we have a motion and a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| We need, there is an amendment that is needed, and the law director will explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| Yeah, in Section 1, it says Chapter 18, Section 18-4 is amended by adding this new subsection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| It really needs to be a little more specific because there are two sections with long lists of things that go as far as number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| And so we really need it to say Chapter 18, Section 18-4, parentheses, C, close parentheses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| so that the folks who are doing the code will be able to tell exactly where this is supposed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| So if someone is willing to do it, if we could have a motion to amend to change Section 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| where it says Chapter 18, Section 18-4, to Chapter 18, Section 18-4, parentheses, C, close parentheses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Okay, so we have a motion and a second on the amendment as just stated by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| We'll vote on that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| So the amendment passes, and now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| And so we have our motion and second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Okay, so the motion passes 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2458)|
| 0:41:09| Section 12D is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code, Chapter 5, Article 4, Chapter 19, Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| to allow temporary goat grazing as a means to control invasive plants on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| You've been waiting on that, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| I just came up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| That's pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| I'm also reading here about electric fence usage related to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| All right, Erin Gill, our Director of Sustainability will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| Hi, Erin Gill, Director of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| In particular, what we're trying to do with the electric fence ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| currently electric fences are prohibited within the city with the exception of outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| This doesn't fall into that category, but electric fences are really useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| We have used them when we have done our goat projects on city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| So what we are adding here is a provision to allow electric fences specifically for permitted goat grazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| So you can see in the ordinance it's limited to essentially whatever 12-volt DC charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| that you would get from a solar panel attached to that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| So it's a very standalone system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| It is temporary in nature, and it must be removed when the permit expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| 12E is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| Zoning Regulations, Article 4, Section 3.2 and 3.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| regarding certain uses in the SC3 district, all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Oh, sorry, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| I just wanted to pause on this one for a minute and go over a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| Director Green, since you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| the specific areas that we're looking at are the Knoxville Center Mall and the Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| That's correct, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Those are the only two areas in the city of Knoxville that are zoned, excuse me, SC3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| Oh, I'm sorry, Gerald Green, NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| So those are the only two areas that we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| And Mr. Seymour, I know you're here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| One thing that struck me when reviewing this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| certainly there's some discussion about auto sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| and that's not something you typically think about when you think about Westtown Mall or Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Do you want to go over a little detail of what the plans are here with auto sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| Westtown Mall has plans for a Tesla dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| I don't think it's been signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| but there's been strong interest in a Tesla dealership on the west side where the Sears Auto Center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2657)|
| 0:44:31| We talked to Mr. Green about this, and I think he's sort of tightly drawn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| Typically, Tesla in the past has only had showrooms because of the way they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| They have a new model of car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| and somebody who buys a car more often than every 12 or 13 years may know what kind it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| but it is apparently an automobile that is, quote, affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| I don't know the name of it, but they would like to have some on their lot for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| MPC has tailored this ordinance to restrict the available number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| There will be no flags, balloons, loudspeakers, radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| or anything that you might associate with certain automobile dealerships in this town and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| It will be a very restricted use, I think, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Let me follow up, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| The plans for this would have to be approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| and there are, as Mr. Seymour said, pretty tight limits on the use of vehicle sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| including the limit of the amount of space that could be dedicated to the image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Also, if it's abutting a street, there's a requirement, which is unusual for vehicle sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| for some buffering and landscaping along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| There are pretty tight limits, and this is not the type of use that you typically equate with a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| It would be very specific and unique to vehicle sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| But all of these proposed amendments go under use on review, go to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| SC3 is a planned district, so any changes would be reviewed by MPC, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| There's a health club-type option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| I don't know if you want to go through the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Okay, I'll go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Hotel, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| More use for office space, entertainment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| One of the challenges that we've certainly seen in Knoxville and nationwide is keeping retail malls viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| and trying to work with the ownership of Westtown Mall to make sure it remains a viable entity in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2812)|
| 0:47:01| Okay, thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| And I would, if I could, I'd like to propose one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| After talking to staff, we've realized that this is with regard to multi-dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| and I emailed Mr. Swanson yesterday, although he didn't check his emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2832)|
| 0:47:21| Or I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Someone else got it whose first name is Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| He's wondering what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| But it's under multi-dwelling facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| It's on page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Might be in his junk mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Specifically with density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Currently it states there shall be no maximum density established for dwelling units in the SC3 zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| The density shall be determined by MPC as part of the project approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| We've proposed to eliminate that last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| The density shall be determined by MPC as part of the project proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Just let the market determine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| These projects are reviewed by MPC, so we were to ensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and that's been reviewed by plans review staff and MPC staff, and we're all in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| And I've let the applicant, Simon Property Group, know if that can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| that would be acceptable to staff and to the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| But still I'm not always well versed on the procedure for amendments to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2895)|
| 0:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| So you're recommending to strike that last sentence that you already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| The density shall be determined by MPC as part of the project approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| So we would need a motion and a second on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| I'll make a motion that we strike the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| that the density shall be determined by MPC as part of the project approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So we had some other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| So are there questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Are your questions about that particular amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| No, not about the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I'll come back to you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Do you have a question about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| We won't vote on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| We'll have more discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Because they actually sent this to us on, I mean, that commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| Does it have to go back to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| No, that would not need to go back to commission because it would be something that the commission had before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| and could have done themselves and elected not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| So arguably they considered whether to do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Well, not that amendment, but they considered the issue in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Just to clarify with Mr. Green, so this was initiated by the Simon Property Group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| The application for the ordinance amendment came from the Simon Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| And all of these changes will apply for all properties within the city limits of Knoxville that have this current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| which there are only two parcels at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| A portion of Knoxville Center Mall and all of Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| So they would be able to reap the benefits of these changes as well as they look for ways to make that property viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| I just want to ask a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| It also states here storage of vehicles for sale shall not exceed 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| So we're saying that if we approve this, they could have up to 100 vehicles on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| And that would take the existing parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| I counted at one time quickly the number of parking spaces at Westtown Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| and this is a relatively small fraction of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And looking at both Westtown and Knoxville Center Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| having 100 vehicles, additional vehicles at either place would actually add some interest to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| especially at Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| And so I understand the example of Tesla being an upscale type automobile vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| but are we also saying that a used car person, tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| We cannot distinguish in all likelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| We discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| If you trade your vehicle in for a new Tesla and they have it on the lot, it's a used vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| So it would be challenging to restrict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| But, again, I would suggest you look at the vehicles at Knoxville Center Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| and answer the question, which I ask myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| could I tell the difference if these were for sale or were part of the customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| or employees at Knoxville Center Mall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| It would be challenging to tell the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| especially with the standards that were proposed for the vehicle sales with regard to no flags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| no amplification, no lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| It basically would be a portion to look at, to all intents and purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| a part of the parking area for the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| So they would have a set parking area where they would have their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| So let's take away the Tesla example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| So if I am a business person and I wanted to rent space in Knoxville Center Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| to have a used car dealership, I would be permitted to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| If you met these standards and it were approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| So I would have to come before MPC as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Okay, it looks like discussion is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| so we'll start with the amendment that Mr. Green had proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| and we have a motion and second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Are you ready to vote on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| So the amendment is passed, and now we go to the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3188)|

| 0:53:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Mr. Petty, did you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3239)|

| 0:54:26| So hopefully you all will feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3266)|

| 0:55:01| We don't have anyone from the building department here this evening, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Well, I'll follow up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Oh, David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Do you want to ask Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Do you want to take a shot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| All right, so it's about trash pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| I can get that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Oh, I know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| So I'll give you a softball first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| So I had hoped to talk to somebody there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| and hadn't been able to get in touch with them about this particular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| We'll have a question for Mr. Green as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| But Mr. Hsu, who's in charge of this project here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| has been working to get it on track and approved to get a tenant in there since December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| So an ongoing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| And I think some of my questions for Mr. Green will address why it's been so challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| But we're going to approve it tonight, or if we approve it tonight on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| it will go to second reading June 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| And there are a couple of things that have to happen contingent after it is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| if and when it is approved for C2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| The deadline for a filing for a BZA variance, which I believe he's also going to need, is June 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3377)|
| 0:56:26| So if we approve it on second reading, then he will miss that deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| and have to be bumped back a full month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| So what we need to do is Mr. Hsu is here after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| We need to sit down with Peter, look at those dates, get with Krista,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| who's the attorney that deals with all of our building inspections, and see if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Mr. Green, could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| So one of the things on this particular agenda item is a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| And can you talk a little bit about the conditions that are attached to the approval for C2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| The condition is that the project, any project there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| go through a review to ensure compliance with the sector plans and the small area plans for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| We have a challenge in that any zoning designation that's applied to that area other than C2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| makes the buildings nonconforming because of their lack of setbacks, lack of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| Development through variances is not the way to develop property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| It's created a challenge for Mr. Hsu in that he's been working on this project, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| at least since last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| The closest zoning designation we have to make those buildings compliant is C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| but it allows a building like the First Tennessee Tower, which would not be appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| So we're asking for a use-only review just to ensure that no building that's out of character with the area is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| That's the condition that would be placed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| And I just got a text from Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| He's aware of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| He'll reach out to Daniel Hsu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| He texted me and said his variants are based on the C3 zoning, and he was at BZA last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| So he's well aware of the situation, and we'll talk with Daniel and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| And, Councilwoman, another option, if you choose to make the motion, is to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| Mr. Green, going back to my questions to you, so when and if we get to and how things progress in RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3515)|
| 0:58:45| will we address some of those issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| We'll address a number of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| The buildings down there, based on the standards and what we anticipate to be the zoning designation under the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| the buildings would become compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| Some of Mr. Hsu's challenges are with curb cuts and engineering standards, and RECODE will not address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| But in terms of buildings, the uses, their placement on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| those will be addressed based on the current draft and our direction with the RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Those are all of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| If no one has any, this agenda item was passed on consent at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| And if there's no issue with it, I'll leave it up to my colleagues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| If we pass it on emergency on first reading, then it would address the issue of the deadline for BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| So what do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Oh, that's a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| You're making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| It would be pass it on emergency tonight and not have it go to second reading on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| So we would pass it in one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| What does he want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Well, Daniel, would you, Mr. Hsu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Mr. Hsu, would you like for this to be passed on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| I'm Dan Hsu, 5412 Dogwood Road, Hospital 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Sure, if you guys could get it done tonight, that would help move us along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| We've been working through the process, trying to get through BZA in the current mixed zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| which actually is C3 and I2 on the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| So the parcel does not meet current C3 zoning because of setbacks on the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| They're right up against the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| In fact, it still doesn't meet it because C2 requires a five-foot setback, but they're right on the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| So we're going to have to go back to BZA for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| Also, the parking lot doesn't meet setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| So it's kind of existing conditions we've got over there that we've got to go back for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| I'll second the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to amend this to pass on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Okay, now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| So that passes on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| 12J is an ordinance to rezone property located on the north side of North Mall Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| west side of East Town Road, from SC3 District to PC2 District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| subject to one condition, Arthur Seymour, Jr., for EBCO applicant, Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| Motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| I just want to address a question to Mr. Green as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| This is another example where it has passed MPC but it has conditions attached to it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| we'll let you explain why it has conditions attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| The condition is for use on review by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| That's for site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| As we look at this, this will be a distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Traffic patterns could be unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Given the recent rezoning of a portion of the Knoxville Center Mall site to multifamily residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3726)|
| 1:02:15| we want to ensure that as the site plan for this use is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| that it does not impede or create challenges for any future multifamily residential development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| The main issue is the traffic pattern and the relationship between this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| and potential use of the adjoining property for multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| We want to have an opportunity to review site plans to ensure that there are no conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| Again, this speaks to some of the challenges with our existing zoning that's 50 or 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| Did not anticipate this mix of uses and potential conflicts between those different uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3766)|
| 1:02:53| and we want to anticipate those and mitigate or avoid them before they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| So do we feel like some of the issues addressed in that condition will be addressed in RECODE as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| RECODE is going to come down from the mountain and solve everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| It's going to be a miracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| I can't wait until that rolls in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| I would just like to say I'm excited to see EBCO stay in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| They're currently in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| If anybody wants to buy a building, they're selling their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| And then staying in the 4th District and putting into use a building out at the Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| So I appreciate you guys expanding and doubling your operations and staying in the District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Okay, Council, we're at the end of the agenda and nobody has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| So we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180605?start=3834)|
