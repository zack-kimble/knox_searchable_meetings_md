| 0:01:45| For discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| The Sheriff's Department takes prisoners out and does a lot of free work in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| Larry is very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| They mow yards for a lot of nonprofits and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| The mower they're using was one that was stolen, and the insurance company said after they paid the homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=124)|
| 0:02:14| they said just to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| But it's getting to the point where they can't maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=139)|

| 0:02:34| I've only gotten this handed in front of me, but it's Commissioner Brown's request for adding this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=154)|
| 0:02:43| This doesn't seem proper to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| I think this is business already decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=166)|

| 0:02:59| I just don't see how this is a proper resolution before us at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=179)|

| 0:03:23| Parson races is what we talked about, not term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| Our discussion, I believe, was partisanship and partisanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| I guess we had discussion on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| It was mentioned and added at the time, but it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=211)|

| 0:21:32| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Item number 38 is the resolution approving a grant contract in the amount of $16,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| no local match required, with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency for off-site emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| planning and response, Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| Resolution that was added, Resolution 903, is a resolution respectfully requesting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| Knox County Legislative Delegation to take all necessary and appropriate steps to secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| legislation to enable the enactment by referendum of term limits for Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1341)|
| 0:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| We have a motion for no recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| And Mr. Brown is being consumed with the conversation at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Do you want to go ahead, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Mr. Brown, you want to speak to your added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| This is the ad resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I had got a call from ADT about an alarm going off in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I apologize for having to take that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| No mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| This resolution, what it would do would be to petition the state legislature to let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| have a referendum on making school board members' term limited just like every other official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Basically, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I think it's fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| And I don't want to put the law director on the spot here, but this seems to be, if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1401)|
| 0:23:30| hashed out by us, this body a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I think we've had this decided by the state judicial process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| So I guess with that said, is this a valid, warranted expenditure process thing for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1420)|
| 0:23:50| to go through when the question has already been asked and answered is my ultimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| But I guess for you, Mr. Law Director, could you speak on the history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| If not now, we can do this in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| I mean, there's no hurry on it, especially with the motion being without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| But could you speak to the history on how we got to where school board members aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| term limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| The actual decision of school board members not being term limited was done in the Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| v. Knox County case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| And they were ruled as from a different article of creation by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| The legislature has assigned the responsibility to the Knox County Commission to create a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| department within Knox County government called the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| But that school board is under Section 49 of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| It has its duties assigned to them by the state legislature through the State Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| So where on the one hand they're created as a department and are funded to a large degree by appropriated dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| from Knox County, and they are a part of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| The courts moved them out because of their duty to the state legislature and to the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| administration that they would not be under the charter in terms of term limits, just as they did the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| and as they did the state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| That's the history as to how it got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| But because it is a judiciary mandate, if you will, rather than a legislative mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| the state legislature has the power to overrule a judiciary mandate as long as it is not a mandate defining an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1538)|
| 0:25:47| unconstitutional thing, meaning that this request is not improper in the sense that you can request the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1547)|
| 0:25:57| And if it is their will and want to do so, they can term limit someone that is underneath their statutes for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1557)|
| 0:26:07| If it is unconstitutional, then they can make an amendment to the Constitution and go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| So it ultimately, you know, the state legislature has the power to address this, even though it has been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| and determined as a judiciary limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Does that help you, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| You know, we could have addressed this when we had the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| I guess it was about a year ago we were meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And, you know, I guess because it was a judiciary opinion in the Jordan versus Knox County, we didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1600)|
| 0:26:50| But our understanding at that time is that it was just about a constitutional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| I mean, I guess we could petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| I mean, if the law director feels we can do it, you know, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| But we could have brought that to referendum and put that in our charter because the Tennessee Constitution says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1623)|
| 0:27:12| that local governments can set up their own form of government independent of the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| I mean, that's what the whole Shelby County versus the Shelby County decision that started the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| the Jordan versus Knox County decision, you know, dealt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| But I think we could put the same thing in here on the judicial officers, I guess, couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| Who can you not put on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Let me clarify the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| The charter can address those that are county offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| To address this term limit as it relates to the school board until defined differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| the state legislature is the only body that can term limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| We couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| We can't even referendum at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| They can give you the authority to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Then we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| And I think if I'm reading this correct, this is what's being asked of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| If it is an unconstitutional issue or a constitutional issue, then it is also only at the power of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| To amend the constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| To amend the constitution and bring it from them to the voters just like we would do to amend a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| So this issue is not something that the county commission can vote on any more than we could the partisan race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| I mean, we can vote to recommend they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| But this is not something that we have the power to implement, you know, unilaterally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Mike, I just got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| How many terms are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Same as commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Is it a two-term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Are you doing a two-term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Do you have people in Nashville ready to sponsor this for you next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Have you talked to some state reps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Oh, that's why I wanted to get on it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| I don't know which one of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| My assistant didn't punch my button, but anyway, that's why I wanted to get on this early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| so we'd have time to work on them before they start their next session in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Yeah, because you have to be early with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Do we have any other discussion at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| It's before us without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Study hard for when we come back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| Ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Item number 39 is an ordinance amending Article III of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Appendix A of the Knox County Code, to prohibit billboards and other advertising structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| As amended, this is Ordinance 0-13-4-101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I want to make a statement about this, and then I'll have a motion to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| And I want to receive the law director's concurrence that the statement that I'm going to make is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| is if we withdraw this ordinance, this can be brought up again at any time without penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| It's just off the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| If we vote on this ordinance and it's voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| then we have to wait a year before it can be brought up and discussed and worked on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| Is it 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| The prevailing side can bring it back within 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| With a two-thirds vote, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Is that a table or a defeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Defeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1863)|
| 0:31:13| In a way, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| I'm going to make a motion to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| If anyone disagrees, we can vote the motion down and then vote on it directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| But I'd like to make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| We have a motion to withdraw in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| I don't know whether it's appropriate to ask for a discussion of the reasoning there, but I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| I don't think we have the votes to pass this that we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| And, you know, part of it deals with if we bring it up or start to bring this up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| I know the argument is going to be made this has already been brought before the commission once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| It's been defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| And, you know, why should we bring up something again that's been defeated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| And I think it sets any discussion off on a negative foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| And, you know, I think we saw from some of the votes that we had when we were even dealing with the digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| is that we did not have, you know, the support, you know, that we needed for it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| And I would rather bring it up fresh than coming in with a black eye and one strike against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| in that the legislative body had already spoken once that they were not in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| I'd rather just start fresh with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| And like I said, if anybody disagrees and thinks we should vote on it today, then we can vote down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Motions to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I would be curious, and maybe Roy Braden can give us some information in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| after the vote in this month, what is the status of billboard permit processes taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| as soon as we withdraw this for the next few months, just to keep an eye on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| But I'll talk to Roy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| On page 11, item number 40 is an ordinance amending Article 2 and Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| Appendix A of the Knox County Code to regulate or prohibit electronic message center signs in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130, adopted September, amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| This is Ordinance 102 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| I would like to make a motion or see if we, I don't know if I need to make a motion for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| but I would like to drop the prohibit electronic message signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| and just leave in there to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| I think it was an either or ordinance anyway, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| The regulations are already set up, aren't they, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| I mean, the recommendations from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| I thought that the reason is, and maybe someone could explain to me where it says to regulate or prohibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| They've got some regulations drawn in there, or they've got a prohibition in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| and it was an either or ordinance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Yes, we provided you two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| One was to outright prohibit them, in which case then you have to create some standards for the ones that already exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| and then to regulate them as another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| So you get to pick one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I would like to pick the regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| And I'm going to do that for the same reason, is that I don't think we're going to have the support to prohibit them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| and it does not close the door in the future to bringing them back up if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| I would like to say that, not that this is necessarily better or worse than what we've recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| The city of Knoxville does ban all billboards, period, and they also ban new electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2110)|
| 0:35:19| I don't think that we'll have the support right now to prohibit completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| or to ban completely the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| I think regulating them is really what the industry seemed to me to be asking for when we were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| We really never got into too much of a discussion about the electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| because these are on-premise signs, and it may be premature at this point to have a complete ban on it for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2139)|
| 0:35:50| But I think for us to regulate the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| and particularly to bring our ordinances in line with what the city of Knoxville has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| reduces or eliminates a lot of the confusion about where signs sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| particularly in areas that are on the fringes right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| And I'd like to make a motion to approve this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| The amended motion is to prohibit electronic messages just to regulate, and we have a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2183)|

| 0:40:15| The discussion item that was added regarding the Sheriff's equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Go ahead with that, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| As I mentioned earlier, they do take the prisoners out and do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| charitable work in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| It has to be for a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| It can't come out and mow your yard, but it has to be for a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| They do also some public right-of-way stuff and all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| And as I mentioned earlier, the mower, the big mower that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| was given to them by the insurance company after a burglary claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| and it's cost them more to keep the thing running than it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| A new mower is about $6,600, one of these big jobbies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| So my question is, how many of you all got $500 left in your discretionary funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| you'd like to chip in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I'd raise the biggest part of it if everybody did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| If you would like to do that, let Jolie know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| and she can have the form that you'll need to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Can we put it all on one, Jolie, or does it have to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| It's mowing season, you know, and we don't meet again for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| So they broke down on them again this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| so we need to do something quickly for them if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| And I'm going to talk to the mayor, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Chris, can you find us a little money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| He's looking under his desk right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Oh, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Sorry, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Tell us where the check was found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| How much are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| $6,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I mean, see what you can gather up, and then we will look for the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| We can find $6,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Don't say that too loudly, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Jolie is going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Jolie, will you send us a reminder about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| and we'll see what we can accumulate from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| and then see what else we need we'll come to you for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Well, as I said a while ago, Chris, it's mowing season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| so time is of the essence on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| So I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you, guys, all of you who do participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Mike, I have a question for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Mike, I happened to stop last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| You're right, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| They come out to halls every other week, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| And I stopped last week, and I was talking to the guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| and he's pointing out the mowers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| And I said, I think this is neat, the way you do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| You get confiscated materials, and then you turn around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and a lot of the guys in prison, that's what they do for a living and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| So they do a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| You come through our area, it looks like a darn golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| They do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| And he pointed out that they just bought a brand-new mower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Check and see, are we reimbursing for that they've already got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| or has the sheriff already got one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Because he was really bragging about the new mower that they just got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Well, I'll double-check with Chris on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| And if not, I'll be happy to get some from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| He called me this morning, so they definitely needed to get a mower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Check and see if they still need it, because he was really bragging about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| And it looked brand-new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| I think they've already got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Okay, Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| They do have a couple of crews going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| So what you're asking is that we all chip in our discretionary funds to repair the sheriff's mower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| Not the whole fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| I mean, everybody gives $500 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| But you're asking us to chip in some of our discretionary funds to fix the sheriff's mower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| To get a new mower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| It's for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Well, essentially it's for the sheriff's department, but they're doing work in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| But they're not mowing the grass of every nonprofit in Knox County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Just certain ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| There are certain ones that are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Well, how do you get on that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Well, you just call up and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Eighty-five percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| You want to get me a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| And does Parks and Rec not have a mower that they can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| They stay busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I know they stay busy, but I'm having a real problem with donating discretionary funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| to buy the sheriff's department a new mower, even if they're mowing nonprofit properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Sheriff, will you clear this up for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| We do not need any of your discretionary monies for mowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Is that what you want me to say, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| I said we do not need any of your discretionary money for mowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Actually, we did have a couple of grants and some stuff from some people who have secured us some lawn mowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| And we're doing all right right now, but if in the future something happens, I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| We got lucky on a couple of things, and we got some good stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| So we're doing all right right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Well, Chris had called me and said you were in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| We were, but we had a couple of the neighborhood had secured about $14,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| so we got two brand-new lawn mowers and some other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| So we're doing good right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Jeff said that he would give you his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| As long as we mow his grass, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Okay, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Mr. Smith's got something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| I just want to say that the work that you guys do to supervise stuff, when they leave, it looks like a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| They really do a good job and take pride in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| So I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| If you'll pass it on to supervisors, they do a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| It's a nice reflection on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Last year, just to give you some kind of idea, with inmate manpower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| we did over 100,000 man hours last year for non-profits with inmate work crews, over 100,000 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2760)|
| 0:46:09| Last Thursday, they took the crew out and cleaned up Chapman Highway for South Fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| And they had ten guys out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| and they cleaned it all the way from Kerns Bakery all the way out to Young High Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| I took them some hot dogs for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| They liked those Bilo hot dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| And don't forget, those guys, you know, they get this helps JJ out on Maloneyville Road, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| because every day they get out, they get work out, they get two for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| So it helps cut down their time out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| It helps everybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Yeah, it's a good program, JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Thank you, and thanks for all your supervision in all those areas related to working prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2805)|
| 0:46:54| and putting them back into service for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Okay, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130415?start=2819)|
