| 0:02:55| I do ask that everyone please limit your time to speak to one question at a time in order to give everyone a chance to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=175)|

| 0:03:09| Also, as the presenters are brought up, please allow them to deliver their information in its entirety before starting the questions as they are likely to answer what it is that you're asking and we can gather all the questions for each section of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=189)|
| 0:03:27| And then finally, we do have a public forum element of the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Most of the, actually all of the lists were ones that signed up in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| If additional people sign up, we'll just do our best depending on the time and the length of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| So we do have that element towards the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| All that being said, we will begin our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| And I would like to call on Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=230)|

| 0:04:21| So my job is to just get us kicked off with a few words about the big picture of where we are in our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| and our progress with the proposed multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| And then I'm going to turn things over to my friend Chris Caldwell to go over tonight's agenda and to introduce our lineup of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=271)|
| 0:04:41| We could just move to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| And I'm not going to go over this in detail, but just kind of big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Does this mirror what's in the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Yes, that should mirror what's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| So you have these slides in front of you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| It could be argued that the vision for the proposed stadium was first cast way back in 1996| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| when the city and the county worked to identify a site to keep the Smokies in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| But I'm not going to go that far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Our current efforts started in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| So that's where we start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| When Mayor O'Hara cast a vision to bring the Tennessee Smokies back to the heart of our region, to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| When we met with you virtually in February, the multi-use stadium project was at a conceptual level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| There were visionary visuals of the site, rough projections of cost and economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| and a theoretical model for financing, all to provide you with some information that we had at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| and to make sure that the project was feasible, that there was enough support to move forward to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| And there's been a lot of work that's happened since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| There have been many community meetings and a lot of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| A sports authority board was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Conceptual designs have been refined into schematic designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| For those of you who are not design professionals, I have learned a lot through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| but the schematic designs provide a level of refinement that I think has brought us to a new level of estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| both for cost and economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| There's also a better understanding of the site and the conditions and the private development possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| A site plan that includes the proposed multi-use stadium and private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| has been submitted to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning as part of the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| Each one of the activities that I outlined has a huge amount of effort and intentionality behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| so it does feel a little bit dismissive to sort of skate over it in 30 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| but we do have just a little bit of time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| So I do want to point out a few key milestones on the timeline that you have in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| and that's up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Over the coming weeks and months, the schematics will evolve into design documents and construction documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| We're aiming to have a development agreement and lease agreement to the sports authority in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| The preliminary plan for the site will be on Planning Commission's agenda in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| as part of the plan development process and will go to City Council for approval in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| We're also aiming to have the interlocal agreement on Council and Commission's agenda in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| and as a reminder, that interlocal agreement will allow the sports authority to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| with executing agreements with the developer and moving forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| The final plan for the site will go to Planning Commission in November and to City Council this winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| Construction would be projected to begin this winter with a completion date sometime late in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| So again, my intention really with this prelude here is to simply let you know why we're asking for your time tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| that there's been a lot of work done and we want to share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=486)|

| 0:10:03| So I'm excited to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| As you can tell from Chris's list of all the people that are talking to you about all the tangible things, I'm a last-minute add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| So they said, since you're here, we'd like to make a few opening comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| So all the tangible, practical things you need to hear, you won't hear from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| So I'm going to give you just a couple of quick comments on why I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| So as a big baseball fan, I've been to 45 Major League ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| And here's what I love about Major League Baseball parks and ballparks of all sizes and shapes across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| First, they reflect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| If you go to a baseball park, if you go to Seattle, they have sushi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| If you go to Pittsburgh, they have knishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| They reflect the community better than anything else in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| And ours, we're going to have Jackie's hot chicken, and we're going to have Jenny's, my wife's, scotch eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=643)|

| 0:10:51| It's going to reflect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| It also brings different people together in the community that don't otherwise get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| One of the things that I found looking at baseball stadiums all across the country is it brings people together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| young and old, black and white, rich and poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| And on occasion, and this doesn't happen all the time, but on occasion you can go to a baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| and actually sitting side by side see Republicans and Democrats sitting side by side enjoying a baseball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| But the problem is that we have so many things that tear us apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| We need more things that bring us together, and baseball stadiums can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| and we're going to make sure this stadium does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| It also, if done well, reflects the history of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| We're working with Beck Cultural Center to make sure that this reflects the community where this stadium is being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| and making sure that it can not only reflect the history but be a foundation for the future of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| But this isn't a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| It's the people's park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| It's going to be so much more than a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| You already know that we've got an agreement to have Major League Soccer at this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| We're going to have family reunions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| We're going to have farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| We're going to have all sorts of community events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| This will be a place where our entire community all across the county will come together to be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And so it's going to do more than just serve baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| It's going to be a community gathering place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| But maybe last comment, even more importantly than all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| it's just going to transform the dynamics of our city forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| Many people that I've talked to over the last several years have talked to me about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| when James White Parkway was built, it built a wall between downtown and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| And we think this project can be a project that will knock down that wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| and build a bridge from downtown to East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| and connect these vibrant parts of our community together once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| This has been a missing link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| The area that we're building in has been desolated and deserted for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| And you can't connect downtown with East Knoxville if you don't do something in this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| We're going to be able to take a spot that's been neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| and turn it into a focal point connecting our city and our East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform our city forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So I was taught when I actually ran for office one time to never forget to ask for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| Actually, all of you guys have had at least one successful campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| so I can't really be giving you advice since I'm 0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| But I will say I would like to ask for your vote for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Maybe in your term, I know maybe in my lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I don't think we'll ever be a part, a witness to an opportunity that can be so transformative for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| So I'd appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| And I'll turn it over to the subject matter experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Thank you, Mr. Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=815)|

| 0:13:55| Okay, that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| When we finished our concepts and began our development of the project in schematic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| we went through a lot of components of the project, especially the multi-use stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| and looked at what other communities were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| We looked at what was going on in Fort Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| We looked at what was going on in Madison, Alabama, in Nashville, in Chattanooga, and other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| and what they did well, trying to learn lessons from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| At our office, we call them precedent pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| But we not only did that for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| We did that for the surrounding plazas and the various components that are going to go into the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| And all of those things led us to a project that is located just east of James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=877)|
| 0:14:57| You see the red area right in the middle of this drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| James White Parkway runs north and south, or up and down the page, right in the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| separating downtown, the old city from this site and the rest of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| You can see some of our landmarks in the neighborhood around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| And you begin to notice there are also some rings around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| And those are distances and walking distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| A quarter mile is about a five-minute walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| And there's an associated number of parking spaces within that five-minute walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| The outer ring, the larger one, is a ten-minute walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| It's a half mile, and there are more than 7,500 parking spaces in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| And there's roughly 6,000 of those that are publicly accessible on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=944)|

| 0:16:04| One of the things that we looked at carefully, where would we park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Do we need to build a lot next to the stadium, next to the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| And almost unanimously, the specialist that we talked to recommended not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| We want people walking through the community to walk by the restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| to walk by the retail shops, to spend their money, not park, come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| walk back out to their car, and go back home to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| So we want to concentrate that and work on that as one of our development concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=990)|
| 0:16:40| If you zoom in to the site, I'm going to orient everyone a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1000)|

| 0:17:10| We're moving Patton Drive, probably going to call it something like Stadium Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| to bend the people around the site and allow them to easily flow from west to east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1035)|
| 0:17:23| We have identified areas where we're tying in to the Greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| I should have mentioned the Greenway system on the previous slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1049)|

| 0:20:58| Ultimately, it will have a large accommodation for a large retail component up to 30,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1258)|

| 0:24:38| and to share the results of our study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Just to introduce myself, my name is Brian Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I work with a company called CSL International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| We were tasked to complete a tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and economic impact assessment related to the development of the multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Just a little bit of background on CSL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| We are a sports and entertainment consulting firm with about 30 years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| We've worked across professional, collegiate, amateur sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| as well as the convention, leisure, and entertainment industries as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| And I just wanted to say at the out front that we take each project that we work on seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| and try to render objective results in accordance with each individual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| We do not alter our numbers to make them look better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| or to try to reach certain thresholds or conclusions to appease our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| We estimate specific assumptions to each project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| and really just let the results fall where they lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| And we took the same kind of objective approach to this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| and I would like to go through the findings of them in the next couple slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| So first of all, this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So to inform our assumptions for the tax revenue and economic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| we benchmarked the Tennessee Smokies across all the other AA baseball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| In particular, one aspect we'd like to highlight is the comparable lease terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| that other AA ballparks opened up since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Lease agreements are a common tool for public entities to essentially lock in a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| into a certain area and keep them in the market for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| So as you can see from this particular page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| the average lease length across AA ballparks opened since 2010 is about 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| with options to extend for about another 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| So the agreements really lock in those teams for a good amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| Base rent for these particular leases averaged about $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| when you add in some other variable rent, which includes maybe a per-ticket fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| That number increases to about $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| And in general, teams and public entities often have a revenue share component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| of the lease agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| where maybe the public sector will receive some naming rights revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| or parking revenue as part of the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| But generally on the expense side, the maintenance falls to the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| The maintenance and general repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| but then the capital repairs often remains on part of the public entity or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| We can go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| So one part of our analysis that we were tasked to look at is to estimate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| potential sales taxes that are related directly to the development of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| What we did for that was we actually estimated the taxable sales that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| generated within the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| That includes things like ticket sales, concessions, merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| In order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| we constructed a financial model for the stadium that included the Smokies as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| as the USL soccer team as the two main tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| as well as a number of third-party events such as concerts and other sporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| And we use this to come up with the amount of actual taxable sales that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| be generated within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| So you can see in the chart on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| the taxable sales in year one was about $12.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And then we applied those sales tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| the sales taxable revenues with the appropriate sales tax rates for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| County and the state of Tennessee and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| That was a 2.25% sales tax rate in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| It was 5.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Normally the sales tax rate is 7% in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| but in order to collect and remit that money for funding of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| you can only actually collect 5.5% of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And the remaining 1.5% is retained by the state for educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| So we estimated in year one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| $12.5 million in taxable sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| which comes out to about $971,000 in total state and County sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| revenue in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| When we look at that over a 30 year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| which is what we consider to be the general life of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| that comes out to a cumulative sales tax revenue of $46.2 million over 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| years. When we look at that on a net present value basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| which is to say looking at the money in terms of today's dollars and not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| future dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| that comes out to about $28.3 million net present value sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| And we can move to the next slide. This is the last slide I'll present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| We also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| as part of our study did an economic impact analysis to figure out how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| what the actual impact of the stadium would have to the local economies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| So to do that, we estimated the construction spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| the amount of spending that would happen within the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| the amount of spending that would happen in the community as a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| people coming to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| So people spending money on gas to travel to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| people spending money at a restaurant because they're wanting to go to dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| before the game. And then we also looked at the mixed use development spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| So all those retail and office residential developments up around the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| all of that is what we call direct spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| So that's spending that is directly attributable to the fact that the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| What we then do to begin to estimate economic impacts is we try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| we convert this direct spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| what we would call gross direct spending into net new direct spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| That new direct spending is the actual money that is attributable directly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| the stadium and would not have occurred if the stadium had not been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| So in order to do that, we make adjustments in our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| in our model from the direct spending for displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Displacement is essentially adjusting for money that already would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| So maybe somebody spends $50 to go to dinner out to the ballpark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| but they would have spent that money going out to eat anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| So we do not count them in our model. Those are not net new direct spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| They are gross direct spending, but they're not net new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| We also account for leakage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| which essentially money that leaves the measured economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| So maybe you hire a landscaping firm for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| for the areas around the ballpark and the landscaping firm is actually based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| out of Chattanooga and not in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So the money that gets spent to that landscaping firm does not stay within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| measured economy. So it is not that new to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| to the city or the county or the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| So we use those two adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| the displacement and leakage to come up with net new direct spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| That net new direct spending then has additional effects as that money gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| re-spent within the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| So maybe somebody spends $50 at a restaurant and then that restaurant then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| spends that $50 on supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| And then that the supplier then now has more money to hire more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| And eventually the money gets spent and spent and spent until it eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| leaves the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| And we use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| that net new direct spending is that we use multipliers from a service called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| RIMS2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| which is used by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| to estimate the amount of indirect and induced spending that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| which is essentially all of the re-spending of that initial net new direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| spending. And so we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| so essentially we have our net new direct spending and then all that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| gets re-spent and re-spent within the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And we add all of that together and that becomes our total output.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And total output is generally the number that you hear when people say there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| is an X amount of economic impact to the entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| We also measure total output in terms of the amount of jobs that are created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| and the amount of personal earnings that those jobs also create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| So you can see in the chart to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| this actually highlights our estimated economic impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| So you can see to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| we have estimated that there will be net new direct spending of about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| $281.9 million over the course of the construction of the stadium and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=1985)|

| 0:33:20| That direct spending of $280 million will generate a total output of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2000)|

| 0:33:41| And this varies a little bit depending on where you're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| Again, our analysis is net new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| So the city, county, and state are all looked at independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| and their impacts are not additive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| For instance, if somebody lives in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| but does not live in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| and they wanted to spend money on some sort of entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| whether it be going to a baseball game or just going to the movies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| if they spend that money in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| then that money is net new to the city because they left the unaffiliated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2053)|

| 0:34:20| And so that is net new money to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| but it is not net new to the county because that money would have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| been spent in some other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| whether it be going to the movies or going bowling or something to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2067)|

| 0:34:31| So generally for the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| economic impacts decrease in the larger of the area that you look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| So it's not additive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| So the $477.7 million to the city is not additive with the $487.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| to the county or the $372.4 million to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| But that is generally the numbers that we are looking at when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| I just wanted to reiterate that we do not set these numbers by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| We are not trying to reach a certain benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| These are just the numbers that came through our model after we inputted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2105)|

| 0:35:09| And this is essentially where we ended up with economic impact of close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| half a billion dollars in the city and county individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2115)|

| 0:36:35| The first estimate was developed in 2019 as part of a high-level master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2195)|

| 0:36:44| Design then moved forward to a 50% schematic design level that provides a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| greater level of design detail, including descriptions of key systems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| included and plans that allow more accurate quantities to be calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2216)|

| 0:37:11| During the 2019 conceptual design effort, members of the development group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| the design team, and city and county representatives traveled to many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| comparable stadiums around the country and region to identify key desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| components that should be incorporated into the conceptual design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| Once the conceptual design was complete, the team evaluated cost information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| from several of the most comparable recently developed stadiums and used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| this information and other historical cost data to arrive at this conceptual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| budget estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| This is a common method at this early stage of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2270)|

| 0:38:18| The first line is the cost of the land at $10 million that is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| contributed by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| The construction costs are the hard costs from the contractor and subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| to build the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| The $54,533,900 includes a contractor contingency of $6,860,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2318)|

| 0:38:55| The soft cost line includes costs that are outside of the hard costs such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| design, project management, and other due diligence costs that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| for the project to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| That cost is $7,121,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| A developer contingency was included in this cost estimate in anticipation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| there could be some added scope to the project as design developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| This amount, as shown, is $3,325,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| The total public-funded project cost is $65 million, plus the $10 million of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2373)|

| 0:39:57| As I mentioned earlier, the design team advanced from conceptual design to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2397)|

| 0:40:04| As this design effort was in progress, an RFP process to select a construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| manager was conducted, and a construction manager was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2411)|
| 0:40:19| And one of their first tasks was to provide a detailed cost estimate of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| schematic design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Once we had the estimate, we went through an evaluation of the costs and design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| or value management, as this is commonly called, in an effort to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| potential cost savings that could be realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| This spreadsheet reflects that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| We have a similar structured spreadsheet here with the same, in the first line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| the same $10 million land cost that is contributed by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| The new hard cost estimate that included the value management effort is $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| There were items identified in the value management effort that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| wanted to stay in the project because they feel they are important to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| success of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| So the developer is contributing $6 million to cover those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| So that total of the public-funded cost of $65 million, $600,000, and $6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2480)|

| 0:41:47| We have removed the developer contingency cost here because we don't anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| adding any scope to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2512)|

| 0:42:46| between the 2019 cost estimate and the 2021 cost estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| First line is steel cost increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| I'll speak more about overall inflation in a minute, but the inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| we showed this in an individual line, to steel is dramatic over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| in some cases over 100% from what we saw previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| This line reflects some increase in steel tonnage as the design developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| but also significant inflation to the cost of steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| The next line, after reviewing the design, it was decided to add some retail space along Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2604)|
| 0:43:34| in an effort to maximize retail opportunities, which also equate to additional tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| activate Jackson Avenue with activity similar to what you see in other parts of the Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| and to break up what was a large, fairly blank facade along Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| This added approximately 22,000 square feet of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| which resulted in an additional cost of $2,400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| Existing soil conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| We recently, we had to wait until the demolition was complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| and recently conducted a subsurface investigation, otherwise known as a geotechnical report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2651)|
| 0:44:20| and this investigation revealed poor soil conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| that are less than what we typically find in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| These soil conditions will add about $500,000 in cost impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| to foundation systems and other seismic requirements in other parts of the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2674)|
| 0:44:47| There were some square foot facility operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| that was not included in the conceptual design and related estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| This cost is $1,275,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| I mentioned the impact of COVID on construction cost inflation previously related to steel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| These inflation costs also affect construction costs across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| We are showing a conservative inflation cost of 8.25% a year over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| which is the 16.5% for an additional cost of $10,725,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2723)|
| 0:45:34| There was an inflation cost in the earlier estimate of what we typically would see of 3% per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2734)|
| 0:45:43| totaling 6% for $3,900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| We have deducted that amount from this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| The total cost increase shown here is $15,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| If you jump down to the bottom of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| you can see the difference between the 2019 and 2021 cost estimates is $15,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2766)|
| 0:46:17| That concludes my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2777)|
| 0:46:35| Hey there, I'm Mark Mametoff, Bass Prairie & Sims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| You've been stuck with me a lot lately, but it's great to see all of you all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| So I'm here to tell you all about financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I wanted to recognize my friend Joe Ayers, who's in the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Joe, as you all may know, does financial advisory work for both the county and the city over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Also, PFM, who does work with the city, also helped us with some of the stuff that I'm going to talk to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| So when you get to the question session, Joe would be available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| So next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| So you just heard from Orlando the cost is likely going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| Keep in mind, we're still at 50% schematic design, so things could still change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| But everyone wants to know what's going on, you know, how's the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| So it could change yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| But that's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| What does that mean in terms of the bottom line to the city and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| I think that's what you all, I'm sure, really care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| So when I've been in front of you all before, we told you $65 million of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| And they know that service is about $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Well, magically, even with $74.5 million cost, the annual debt actually has gone down significantly to $3.2 million if we went to market today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2854)|
| 0:47:46| And it's not because we are magicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| It's for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| One reason is we got $13.5 million from the state, or we shall have it soon in an account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| Because we got $13.5 million from the state, we don't have to borrow that $13.5 million that we saved significantly on interest costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Also, we were using very conservative interest rates when we've been in 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| We didn't want to oversell this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| And what we are showing you now are current interest rates as we're getting closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| These are, as of right now, if we went to market, how much the debt service would be to issue this debt, the $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2895)|
| 0:48:25| By the way, this is Stephanie's slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| She's a financial guru, and it should really say annual debt service, but she cut off a word there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| So that's a big factor in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| So markets have hung in there very well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Both Joe's firm and PFM ran these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| They both came out within $50,000 of each other and ran them in multiple scenarios using different structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| and they all were within $3.1 and $3.2 million of annual debt service to do the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| So that's about $800,000 less than what I told you guys when we were at the very early stages of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| So let's talk in a little bit more detail about that, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| So where are we right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| If we do decide, and when I say we, that's on you all, obviously, to move forward with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| $74.5 million is the cost right now, as you just heard from Orlando.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| We have $13.5 million coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| That gets the amount of money we need down to $61 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| We don't want you all to have to come out of your budget during the construction period to pay interest expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| So if we capitalize interest into the bond issue for two years to get us beyond when they're playing baseball games and soccer games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| that plus paying the greedy lawyers like me gets you up to, that's the capitalized interest in the bond issuance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| I should also say greedy underwriters in the whole list of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| So that would get you back up to about $65 million of what we need to finance things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| So where are we going to get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Well, you heard from Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| He showed you all the sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Remember, I was coming in front of you all about this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Well, we didn't get the district around the stadium, but we did get the legislation cleared up that we get the sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| not just on baseball games, but soccer games, weddings, everything, events that happen at that stadium, we get the sales tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3019)|
| 0:50:27| the 5.5 percent that otherwise would go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| So as Brian estimated, and I want you all to understand, that was a low estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| My friend Doug Kirchhofer, who's here from the team, he was very disappointed with that estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| That was much lower ticket numbers than he would tell you he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| The soccer guy said those are much lower numbers than what we're projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| For example, he used $2,750 for his soccer attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Most soccer teams of the nature that's coming in here are running about $4,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| So that's a good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| He used very conservative numbers on the sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| As he showed you, he's projecting, very first year we opened, $971,000 of sales tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| growing to over $2 million in the 30th year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| So that money would be totally available to pay debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| The present value of that, which essentially is how much you're able to borrow against that or pay with that, was almost $28.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| I rounded down to $28.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Very important for you all to remember, two-thirds of that is paid by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| So almost $20 million of that, 19 or so, is paid through state sales tax dollars that we otherwise wouldn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| So that's really important to realize that the state has been a tremendous partner in this project with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| plus the $13.5 million that they have also given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And so we should be very thankful that they've been so cooperative with us to support this project in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| So that gets it down substantially to about $37 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| The team, as you all know, we're still negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| But I think after us telling them this a zillion times, that the minimum that we're looking for is $1 million of fixed rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| And we'll talk about rent here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| But let's assume that they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| That will pay another $19 million plus of this, or about $19.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I rounded to $19.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| That would be a taxable series of bonds because it's being paid from a private source and not a tax source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| And so that money would be, that's how we would pay yet another $19.4 million of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| The reason this chart is different from the ones that I showed you all before that showed the annual amount of money coming in each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| is with the sales tax starting low and going high, that chart would have been misleading to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| because it would have not been accurate over the life of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| So if you take that taxable debt off from the amount, that gets us down to $17.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3162)|
| 0:52:51| So you all heard tonight that they're ready to move forward with buildings A, B, and C as shown on that site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| That's over $100 million of private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| The vast majority of it, I shouldn't say vast, the majority of it is certainly going to be commercially assessed at 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| There's going to be some condos that will be assessed at 25%, but there's a lot of retail and parking and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| that will be assessed at the 40% level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| I was hoping that we'd get $650,000 out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| Based on that, if they do the $100 million, which we'll talk about in a minute, which they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| that would roughly, being very conservative in my judgment, be about $750,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| which would support another $14.5 million of this debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| So of the debt that you all might have to support total, that would get it down to about $3.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3220)|
| 0:53:49| Because the sales tax numbers start at 971 and go up, in the first year the stadium was opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| you all, the total between the city and county might have to come out of pocket at half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| I put 480 here, which is a little bit more accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| By the 10th year, if the sales tax grew the way Brian outlined for it, it would be paying for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| If they build that other building, they talked about building G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| the incremental property tax revenues off that also would get us to a break-even at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| So they're not quite ready to pull the trigger on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| As you heard, it needs to be the staging area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| but I think Randy and his team would tell you that they are very excited about that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| and are going to move forward with it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| So that gives you an update on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| This is, again, a summary, more similar to what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| but it lists those sources that I just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| And if you want to compare that with what we did a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| this describes a much more accurate view based on current numbers of how we're paying for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| And this is the $65 million after the state grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Again, it's important to note this is based on a $3.2 million current interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| Interest rates could go up or down any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| So that's why it's so hard to always keep you all informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Like, you may call me next week and I'm going to tell you interest rates doubled or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| and I'm going to blame Joe Ayers, but he will then blame me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| All right, I'm going to switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| They asked me to speak a little bit about where are we on contracts in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| how come you guys aren't seeing drafts on your agenda yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| We've got a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Not because we're not working hard, it's because we've been focusing on the finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| and trying to get conceptually where we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| They have an excellent lawyer, Dennis Ragsdale, who is representing the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| My friend Kelber Schmidt, by the way, is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Kelber is representing the Sports Authority and will be helping with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| So the development agreement for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| We're getting a lot of questions from some of you all about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Okay, I don't want cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| I've seen you all comment on the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| So that's our goal, and it was our goal from when we met with each of you all individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| So our goal is to have a turnkey development agreement with adequate security with the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| or an affiliate of the team that says you shall build the stadium for blank dollars, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| And cost overruns are your issue, and that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| I mean, we don't have anything ready yet, but that's certainly the tenor of our conversations right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| And so more than we can go through tonight, but obviously we're still at the schematic design phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| and so there are still a lot of ifs as to cost things, and we're going to have to get those finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| And certainly at some point I know that the team is very ready to go when we're ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| but obviously the contingency is quite large now because of the uncertainties as to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| and that will obviously continue to be examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| So that document, as I told all of you all in that time, would come back to you all when we ask you all for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| I know Carson, you asked me about that several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| This is a key document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| It will come to you when you're asked to vote on the financing of this, each of these bodies, as well as the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| And so this will come to you all, and you'll be able to see a good draft or essentially a final draft of this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3436)|
| 0:57:26| and comment on and to understand sort of how this document will hopefully protect us from cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3446)|
| 0:57:35| We've still got a lot to negotiate, as I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| What do you do with the contingency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| What if it comes under it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Again, those are the things that we sit around the table and are talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| Then there's the lease itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| We also have a very rough draft of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| But again, we are seeking fixed rent, a million dollars a year minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| Again, you all have told me, you say, Mark, why don't we go after all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| You saw that chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Go after the naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Go after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| But you see the fixed rent that other people are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| The average is $279,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| We're more than willing to negotiate a variable rent deal with us and share in the upside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| But when you share in the upside, you're certainly going to ask us to share in the downside too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| So if you all feel strongly that you don't like this fixed rent idea, that you'd rather us seek a variable share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| variable revenues, the biggest ticket item is naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| Regents Field in Birmingham is the most expensive AA team, half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| It's in this report that you all read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| I think it was 30 AA baseball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Only 17 have even sold successfully their naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| So we could go in hoping we'd get a share in name rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| If they're not able to sell them, we'll have a big goose egg, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| And that is probably the most lucrative thing that these folks share when you look at the charts that Brian will include in that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3527)|
| 0:58:56| That report is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| I mean, I don't read that many reports, but I had a great time reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| It's a lot of good information about AA baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| I hope you all will take the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| And a lot of those sort of things are discussed in there, and, again, we'll be glad to talk about that further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| if any of you all have questions about that because that is a key negotiating point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| As Brian mentioned, it is essential that you all don't get stuck with operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| and, again, that's something that they've agreed to do from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| So you will not have the ongoing operating expenses in the stadium as often happens with public facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3564)|
| 0:59:35| And, obviously, one thing we want to make sure is that they widely promote the use of the stadium for all events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| I mean, they have every incentive to do so, but, obviously, we want to facilitate the use by soccer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| by concerts, and other community events and public uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| And the last, I always talk about sort of the three-legged stool of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| This is one we haven't even started drafting yet, but, as you all heard, there's $100 million minimum of private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| And I'm sure, again, that the team representatives will tell you we are still absolutely planning on exceeding the $140-something million figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3604)|
| 1:00:12| If they build Building G, that certainly will get them significantly over that, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| But we need to know that those incremental tax revenues will be coming in as part of the financing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| I'm sure you all will want to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| So the $100 million of private development can't be a hope and a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| It's got to be committed to in writing, a legal obligation of them to build it, and not only to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| but to open it when we are ready to open the stadium so it gets on the tax rolls by January 1st of 2024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| so that we can start collecting property taxes for the 2024 tax year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| And, again, this would probably be allocated to help pay for the stadium through some sort of tip or pilot structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3644)|
| 1:00:52| Again, it would be a long discussion tonight, but those are essential revenue sources I outlined before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| and this agreement will be the agreement that would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| So that also agreement, which I haven't really started negotiating yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| would be sort of the third major document that we would bring to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| along with the agreement to support the bond issue from non-property tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| if and when this project is ready for prime time and to be presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| So thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| I think I'm turning it back over to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Great. Yes. Thanks so much, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| And as Ms. Phyllis Nichols is coming up to the podium, I just wanted to say a few words of introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| and maybe a little bit of context setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Every step of the process as we've been moving forward with the proposed multi-use stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| has really been influenced by a vision to ensure that the project benefits people in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| particularly those who have been left behind by urban renewal and disinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| And the intention has been translated into partnerships, real partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| one with the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I'm going to introduce Phyllis in just a second, but also between GEM Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| Mr. Boyd, and the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| to recognize and learn from the history of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| And with the Knoxville Area Urban League, and Phyllis is going to talk about the work that they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| But I just wanted to note a couple of other investments that I think are really noteworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| You know, I've known Randy Boyd for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| so it's really hard to talk about the years of investment he's made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| not just of his financial means but also his time working as a big brother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| and all of the other ways that he volunteers in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| Randy and GEM Community Development have already invested over a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| to renovate Claude Walker Park in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| over $3 million to support center city programs for youth education, mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| and community development, and nearly $600,000 in grants to youth athletic associations in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| One thing that we've heard again and again as we've listened to members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| is that there are so many people that are asking for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| Opportunities for youth, adults, and retirees to earn some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| and that this project must provide opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| particularly for disadvantaged business enterprise firms, DBE firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| to build their capacity and to participate in the project in a way that helps our community thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3823)|
| 1:03:52| So I'm going to turn it over to Phyllis Nichols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| who will talk specifically about partnerships and work that's in place to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| And I think that Ms. Nichols does not need an introduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| but she is the president and CEO of the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Thank you, Chris, for inviting us to be part of the presentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| I get to back clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| I'm last on the roster, it looks like, and I'm glad to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| because I kind of want to do a mind shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| You've been looking at schematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| You've been looking at numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I want to talk about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I want to talk about the community investment in this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| because we're talking about a facility, but a building is just a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| We're going to talk about the inhabitants of the building and the use of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| and also the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Several of you, I think all of you, received a letter from me early, early this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| because I was really passionate about the economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| that this project was bringing to the constituents that we serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| constituents that were looking for opportunities for their businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| constituents that were looking for jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| but also constituents who were looking for a revitalization in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3913)|
| 1:05:21| We were excited only if the opportunity to have an intentional investment existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| and so we knocked on the door for an opportunity and were invited in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| And so I will tell you that the intentional opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| for disadvantaged business enterprises exists for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| and I will tell you some of the things that we have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| to make sure that the opportunity exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| One of the things that we have been working on for the multi-use stadium construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| is to make sure that opportunities exist for construction companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| Heretofore, one of the things that we have learned from small disadvantaged businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| is that they learn about the project too late to enter a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| or that bids are too large for them to qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| And so the work of the Urban League and with the other partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| is to make sure that people have ample opportunity to prepare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| that the information is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| and if there are need for opportunities to team or to partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| that those opportunities are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Not only will we make sure, because we know that the project, you saw a timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| we have that opportunity in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| We want to build the capacity for people within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| to operate their small businesses as part of the multi-use stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| We want to make sure that we develop workforce initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| so that people within the community have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| We are partnering with both Pellissippi and TCAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| to identify the construction jobs that are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| the customer service and retail jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| and we are preparing the workforce that the jobs are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| But here's a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| It's not just a one-use, one-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Our community is braced for construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| Knoxville has some other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| but we have to prepare our workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| and we've got to provide people a bridge to the training opportunities that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4062)|

| 1:15:44| In the analysis of revenue and expenditures, I did not see where there's a set aside for capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| I see that in most of the leases that we have before us from other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| has the operations on the team, but where does the money for capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| and long-term maintenance come from in this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| Let me take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4572)|
| 1:16:20| Right now some of the discussions we're having on the contingency is that some of that would serve as a seed money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| for a capital reserve fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| The first several years of the stadium will need very little money for a capital reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| so typically that type of money, the obligation to start maintaining a capital reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| would generally be shared by the city and county in this case is the most likely answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| but also because of the many revenue sources we have, if we have additional revenue sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| they certainly would be a high priority for a capital reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| I don't really have a great answer for this because it's part of the negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| but we are hoping that we can certainly seed it from some of the contingency that would not be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4619)|
| 1:17:09| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| Am I pushing the button?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Okay, that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Make sure I'm not smashing the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| I guess I'm going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Am I limited to one question here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Well, I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Let's start with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Start with one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Just keep your light on if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| All right, I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I feel like I want to hit a different topic, but I feel like Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| I wanted to tack on a little more to what he said, but I'll go with the next question on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| It seems like the projections of how things are going to get paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| and how the debt service is paid down seems to have a lot of contingency on the tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4670)|
| 1:17:59| from the surrounding buildings that are anticipated for a total of $100 million in their values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| That's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Out of the ground, $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Are there any conversations about pilots or TIFs for those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| So the number that I used, Councilwoman Ryder, is half of the projected tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| for that $100 million, assuming a 50-50 split in terms of a TIF or a pilot with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| Nobody's agreed to that, but of numbers that I was using, the $750 would be actually 50% of the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| not the total tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| So your math has some anticipation of potential TIFs or pilots, so you're not doing math assuming none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| and then later on, oh, look, now we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| The math, which is consistent with the math we did several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| which projected a $650,000 number, it was half as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| I was using an $80 million number approximately at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| They upped this to a $100 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| But they also converted some of what was going to be apartments to condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| which results in a 25% assessment, as I mentioned, instead of a 40% assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| So we didn't get the full benefit of a $20 million increase in capital costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| But, yes, that number assumes a 50-50 split on the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| And certainly by the time we would come back to you all again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| we'll have better plans and specs for the pilot development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| We'll have gotten the assessor's office involved to be able to help us value that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| This is, I don't even want to say back of the envelope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| because it's based on the projected construction costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| which are a pretty good barometer of what the initial tax valuation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| But they're not, certainly we'll have better numbers for you by the time that thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| and they'll have better numbers on their construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| that will be able to give you a better idea of what the value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| I will relinquish my microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Keep your light on if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Mr. Smith from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4805)|

| 1:20:09| I had a question for Deputy Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Affordable housing is something that's extremely important in our city at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Can you talk a little bit about the environment around this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| as it relates to how many affordable housing units do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| compared to other parts of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| One of the things we're all cautious of is making sure we don't displace anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| We've learned that lesson, and so I want to make sure we're mindful of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| And you're asking me to remember numbers, which is never a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| I know I remember sending you some information about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| and some work that KCDC did for the city to look at the number of long-term affordable units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| in the half-mile and mile radius around the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| And I don't remember the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| It was in the thousands as far as the number of units that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| and projected to be online because of the Austin Homes redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| which is one thing I want to speak to briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| But in addition to the long-term affordability that exists already in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4873)|
| 1:21:21| because of the housing stock that's there, we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4881)|
| 1:21:30| We just did a groundbreaking, and thank you for many of you who were there yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| for Caswell Manor, which will be in addition of, I think it was 48 permanent supportive housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4895)|
| 1:21:44| We're adding connectivity to Austin Homes, and there will be additional units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| affordable units and workforce units available at Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| So one of the things I think that we're really excited about with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| is that it will actually provide some really great ways and new resources for an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4918)|
| 1:22:06| that has a lot of affordable housing but doesn't necessarily have a lot of amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| that are connecting those housing units into a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Thank you very much. Mr. Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| I was looking at this financing plan using payment sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| My question is this. I've got to go back to people that I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| and sell them on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| The bottom line is how much is the taxpayer on the hook for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| if some of these things don't come about in this plan of pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4965)|
| 1:22:55| Commissioner Busler, the $13.5 million is obviously going to be money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4975)|
| 1:23:04| The remainder of the sales tax revenues, if we had a pandemic every other year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| the sales tax revenues are definitely going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| The property tax revenues coming off the buildings are unlikely to be affected significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| Once those buildings are built, the variable nature of that income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| will only really be affected by reappraisal and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| So those are pretty solid set of payments, the $1 million of rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| unless the team defaults and goes away, that's a rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| Ultimately, the answer is that the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| assuming that we go along the lines that have been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| and nobody's agreed to anything yet, they would 50-50 have a split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| to make up any shortfalls of debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| I was trying to show you all what that likely shortfall would be at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| which would be fairly minimal, but you're absolutely right that your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| need to know that ultimately the city and the county, from non-property tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| would be committing to make up any shortfalls in the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| that may occur in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Well, I was thinking about amount because we have to come up with some money up front, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Well, if these projections coming from CSL, coming from property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| are within the ballpark, the very first year it would be a little bit under half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5054)|
| 1:24:25| that the city and the county would have to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| After year 10, assuming the sales tax projections are correct, that would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| If building G is built, going back again to Councilwoman Ryder's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| even if you just split those and did a 50-50 on the incremental tax revenues off of that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| that should also eliminate any deficit at that period in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| But based on the projections on the sales tax revenues by year 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| essentially the project would be self-supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| But again, it's important for all of us to recognize that we can't control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| extraordinary events such as a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| I mean, obviously, if you have no one at games, you're not selling many hot dogs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| The question really is when I go buy something, if I don't have the money to pay for it up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| I have to put a down payment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| What I want to know is year one, what does the city and the county have to come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| We have the $13.5 million grant from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| It's not like a home mortgage where you have to put a certain amount of equity down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| So it's a zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Yeah, other than the $13.5 million, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| There's nothing, and we're going to capitalize interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| at least that's the current game plan for the first two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| so there would be nothing that would be coming out of the budgets of the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| a request even to come out of their budgets until the 2024 fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| the second half of that fiscal year when the stadium would be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| Mr. Ramitoff, following up on that question, just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| at the end of the day the vote that we'll be asking for from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| and the county is to guarantee a certain amount of dollars that is part of the bond issuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| and then to spend a certain amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| Could you just clarify the guarantee side versus the spend side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| I'm not sure, Chairman Larson, Chairman Jay, and you're also Chairman Larson, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| Let me try to answer your question and you can correct me if I'm not answering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| So it's really important just as a nerdy lawyer like me to recognize this is not a guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| a traditional guarantee in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| You cannot be required to raise property taxes to pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| You're committing to use your non-tax revenues, which are largely pilot payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| things like that, that you get from other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| This is not a traditional guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| It would be like me guaranteeing my daughter to buy a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| but I only agreed to pay it out of a certain fund that I set aside to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| So I really want to make sure we don't use the word guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| because it sounds like the full faith and credit of the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| which is not what is happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| But yes, the city and the county would, from those sources, be agreeing to make up any shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| In terms of the sources to be used, that chart sort of outlined the sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| but right now, again, a lot to be negotiated still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| but if you ended up borrowing the $65.something that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| which is after the grant, then they would come from four primary sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| rent, incremental tax revenues, property tax revenues through a TIF or a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| and then the biggest number would be sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| One thing I don't think I mentioned before is I think when I came in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| I told you all, based on Sevierville's numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| that we had hoped to get $450,000 a year leave from sales tax revenues from the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| but due to our changes in our state law that we were able to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| plus the fact that this is an urban area based on comparable ticket sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| in similar markets across the country, as you saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| CSL is estimating that those tax revenues are more than double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| of the conservative number we were using before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| Ms. Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| I get a lot of questions about a community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| so I want to know where we are in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| Will there be one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I just want to hear a clear answer, yes or no, and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| Yes, thanks, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| I don't want to steal the stage from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| So thanks, Commissioner Lundy, for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| I think the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Community benefits agreements are not typically negotiated between government entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| and a private entity, and to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| there is not a community benefits agreement being negotiated between the private developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| and a nonprofit per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| I believe that, as we heard from the Knoxville Area Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| which is a nonprofit organization, that there are agreements that I think may have been executed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| at this point around specific outreach to DBE business enterprises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5361)|
| 1:29:31| and we're obviously continuing to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| and thank goodness for our sports authority board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| They're very interested and intentional about, at every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| talking about how is this project benefiting our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| Are we talking about internships, jobs, investment, connectivity to the surrounding area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| So the answer to your question is no to the community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| and I don't want you to take that as, oh, there's no consideration being given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| to how this project benefits people and benefits communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| I think that has been very intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Let me piggyback off of Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| As a community commitment, does that serve in some capacity as a commitment to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5419)|
| 1:30:31| even though we don't have the work benefits in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| And is that something with the Urban League being a nonprofit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| If there were some strong suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| could that potentially be the place where that conversation is held with the Urban League?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| I'll start with that, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Again, this has been a very important conversation that's been ongoing from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| about the commitment to ensure that this project serves as an opportunity to lift people up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5458)|
| 1:31:10| and to benefit our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| So I would say that one of the reasons that we've been really clear about commitment to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| is that there are aspects of the development and the agreements between the city, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| the sports authority, the developer that will be contractual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| And so there are aspects of commitment that will directly benefit the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| that can be part of those agreements and that we're discussing as part of those agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| There are other commitments that the private developer will enter into with nonprofits such as the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| I think that the other thing that I did not mention is that one of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| in order for a project to go through the planned development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| which is the land use process for this site, is that there have to be public benefits identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5521)|
| 1:32:10| And those are requirements that once it's in the plan and it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| those public benefits have to be realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| So when it comes to land use, we know the connection, for instance, between urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| which was a lot of land use policy, and its impact on communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| So ensuring that those public benefits and the impact on communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| considered in that land use process I think is also very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| So I don't know if I'm answering your question clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| There are commitments that are in various places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| and it is a constant communication and dialogue with all of the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| to ensure that we're putting those into writing and making them contractual when it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| So yes and no in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| It sounds like there are going to be some agreements that will be in different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| not everything housed in one central location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| With that said, I want to go back to the DBE requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| and ask how will that be tracked and reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| I can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Those are things that we'll have to be very, very specific in the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| But certainly there will be very rigorous reporting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| And I should start by saying that there's the private side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| and then there's the public side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| On the public side, we can require very detailed reporting to show DBE efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| And we've reached out to consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| Nakesha has been a tremendous amount of help to help us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| sort of how best practices in this area are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| And so we will have the necessary forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| I don't think we're going to have a full answer to you that we can really show you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| okay, these are the forms, this thing, until we start finalizing the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| But I can tell you that that's something that we're planning on embodying in the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| and making sure it's very rigorous and constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| And the sports authority will be keeping a careful eye on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| And I'm sure they'll get monthly reports on that once the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| assuming this project is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| If I could just add quickly that there were members of the consultant team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| including the Urban League, who were specifically selected due to their expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| and not just expertise but experience in DBE programs and DBE accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| So I think if there are specific questions about how that's playing out in the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| as it stands right now, I think there are some folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| who could also answer some of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| Mr. Vicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| First off, thank you all for providing us with an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| all the time, effort, and energy that you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Going into this, I felt pretty good about some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| I've got a little bit of heartburn, and I'll have several questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| so I'll email you guys those questions separately because it could drag on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| But more than anything, I just kind of want to make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| because one of the things that I was going into this entire project absolutely excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| was the fact that we were going to put in a grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| because I've been told many times the 1st District has a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| I've heard it from Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| I've heard it from leaders in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| And I can't help but notice that the grocery store is in Building G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| and now we're talking about Building G not even being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| And that was one of the things that a lot of the members in the 1st District were happy about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| was a grocery store coming closer to their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| So can we shed some light on that situation maybe in an update later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| or put some sort of plan into place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| The buildings A, B, and C don't have a sufficient footprint for an urban grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5765)|
| 1:36:13| You almost have to have a minimum of 30,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| And G provided us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| It just happens to be on the side of the road where there is a current vacant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| and an underutilized building that can be primaries for staging for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| And I think that's the only holdup for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| I don't think there's a current plan to not have that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| So you're saying G is going to happen and a grocery store will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| There is a 30,000 square foot footprint in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| I don't think you can guarantee that any of those grocery stores are going to take that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| but that is the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| This is a great update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| I'm looking that the average rent or leases on these other stadiums is like $300,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5820)|
| 1:37:11| And I'm hearing that the lease on this stadium will be $1 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5831)|
| 1:37:19| Am I missing something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| I would say you're not missing it, but the $297,000 average is just of the fixed rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| One thing, and we'll be asking Brian's firm's help to try to learn a little bit more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| is the incentive rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| We just don't know what they are at all these stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| We don't know if they sold naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| As you see, some of these split the naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| If they didn't sell naming rights, then, as I joked before, 0% of 0 is 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| So we don't know what variable compensation some of these folks are getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| and certainly we'll ask CSL to provide us more data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| One reason we started with the $1 million number is the Toyota Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| which is the newest field in the AA market in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| It's outside of Huntsville in the city of Madison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| It is listed here, as you note, as $250,000 fixed rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| but their variable sources of income that they expect to get up to $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| And so that's sort of the floor for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| and so that's been our floor as well as the most recent comp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| if you're a real estate person in this type of market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| Who will actually run the operations of this stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| That would be run by the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| I mean, they would be the lessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| and they would run the operations on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| In effect, Boyd Sports would have essentially total control over the use of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| and it would be up to their folks to market and bring in the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5939)|
| 1:39:09| and all these other things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| That would not fall under the responsibility of the city or county to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I guess what we're envisioning is that there would be the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| would obviously remain very engaged in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| and that they would have regular updates on programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| and they would be required to provide those updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| They would just, much like the DBE question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| they would have to show that they've reached out to what have they done to get concerts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| what have they done to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| I mean, they have every incentive to do it because it creates concession revenue for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| but at the same time, we want to know when is Leonard Skinner coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| And so that's the kind of thing that we're counting on the sports authority to make sure that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| Why are you laughing at Leonard Skinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| I love Leonard Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| But anyway, that's what we're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| Could be the Beach Boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Okay, Beach Boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| I think more of them are dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| Mr. Mamentoff, to clarify the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| essentially other stadiums, if I'm correct, do a smaller amount of rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| and then share in variable profits based upon X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| The proposal before us is to have a larger fixed amount of rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| and then not have the variables that may be great but may be not so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| I'm sorry to interrupt again, but I do think the convention center is the best model thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| If they're the city, owns the convention center, operates it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| and not due to anything the city is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| they have a significant operating loss each year that they have to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| But it's hopefully more than paid for from the tourism dollars that are generated by the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| But we're trying, by giving control to the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| the goal is to not have those operating deficits to be a burden on the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| It's sort of typical in this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| I mean, we could ask the team to say, look, we'll just lease it to you for baseball games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| and we'll run it as a municipal facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Number one, I don't think they would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| You can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| But number two, it would expose the city and the county to operating losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| which we're trying to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| Mr. Skinneker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| I wanted to go back on to some of the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| On a project of this size, is typically the soft cost 13.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6086)|
| 1:41:36| I would have to defer to Kelly or someone in Orlando.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| That's a reasonable standard for a project of this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| So that's an industry standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| And then a lot of times also incorporated in soft costs for developers is the cost of financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6111)|
| 1:41:58| But in our situation, the cost of financing is not going to be included in the soft costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| But we're still paying the same amount as what other people would do if they included the financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| the same percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| The soft costs would typically be higher if financing costs were included in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| And then can I ask another quick question on the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| Super quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| And I think in our preliminary discussions with Mr. Caldwell, we were informed, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| that the land cost was being donated by the developer at $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| Was that a correct statement as of, like, back in the spring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| I think ultimately that number comes from what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| it was estimated between 6 and 8 what Mr. Boyd paid for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| Then they got what you're seeing now is an appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| Okay, a current appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| So it actually, your estimates now, it's increased 65% to $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| And the 6 to 8 would just be an estimate on what he may have paid for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Does that include the site prep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| I mean, that's also being included in the donation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| That's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| That's being negotiated as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Mr. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| I want to follow up on Commissioner Hill's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| Mark and Stephanie and Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| did we not discuss in the previous that the city and the county would get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| like, 20 some odd days' use of the facility for free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Yeah, we have typical, it's more like 10, Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| for civic uses and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| This is a multi-purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I know you're tired of us using that phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| but I'm not using it in the soccer thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| It will have many areas, obviously, like pavement areas and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| that can have public things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| But generally the times reserved, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| if you wanted to have a Veterans Day celebration or something there for pure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| civic use, that certainly is contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| That has not changed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| I don't think it will be 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Normally these things are somewhere between 5 and 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| and we have to negotiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| I don't think that will be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| It's just the setup and all that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| So they don't typically, most cities don't end up using their own stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| more than a few times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| but we certainly want to preserve that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| Before I start in second-round questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| I'd just like to ask a question myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| Who will be issuing and holding the debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| The issuer of the debt would be the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| Again, they would issue bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| and the city and the county would enter into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| with the sports authority, which said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| if you do not have adequate revenue sources to pay the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| we will make up the shortfall from non-tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| We're sort of the cosigner of the loan, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Please stop saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| I'm joking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| No, they're not the cosigner because it's not a guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| as I was describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| We are a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Well, you are a limited payment source for the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| and it is sold, we need to be very clear, on city-county credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| As I told you all at some prior meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| these bonds will be likely rated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| and Joe Ayres certainly could kick me or correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| but they're likely to be rated at most one notch below the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| and the county debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| So if the city and county are AA+,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| these would be like AA bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| But they will be on the balance sheet of the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| not on the balance sheet of the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| Yes, there will probably be a note on both the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| and county's balance sheet as to the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| to make up shortfalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| I do not believe, and Chris is probably the best person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| to address this, I do not believe it will show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| as a liability directly on the balance sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| because it's contingent and it's also uncertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| so I doubt it would be booked as a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Probably just a footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Second round of questions, Mr. Smith from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| Looking at the 2021 50% schematic design estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| being a layman, not an architect or an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| could you explain what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Does that mean that 50% of the design is hammered out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| and we have a solid estimate on that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| And what kind of lead way does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| what could be the difference between a 50% schematic design estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| and a 100% schematic design estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6383)|
| 1:46:34| Mr. Hess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| In this instance, what 50% means is that we had gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| and the planning, the floor plan, site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| everything is fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| The elevations and the third dimension is not as developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| However, our engineering team has full descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| that are typical of 100% schematic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| so HVAC systems, electrical, plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| all of those things have been priced as they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| at 100% schematic design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| So it's in a compressed, very compressed schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| We did as much as we possibly could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| so that the numbers were as accurate as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| So is there room in the final to either go up or down on cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| There is a contingency built in that Orlando was clear to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| in both of those that is there to cover any sort of estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| or design challenges that come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| Okay, so capital repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| So I think Commissioner Smith asked a question earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| about maintenance and repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| and your answer was that some of that stuff is going to get ironed out still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| So I assume that means like a seat gets torn or broken, that's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| That's general repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| But then capital repairs, we should have some sense or some estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| you know, like HVAC is going to last X amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| because we do those types of capital repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| and planning for our existing things like the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| So at some point will we have some sense and some numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| to look at over the life of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| So you guys have presented us finances to say, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| if all goes well and according to these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| this will be paid off in, you know, 10 years and so forth, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| But can we have some sense of how over the course of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| we're on the hook for capital repairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| And maybe not tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| but I think we need some answers for the public on that type of anticipation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| We don't have those tonight, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| But, yes, those are things that we will be able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| And how are you coming up with those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Are we able to get information from other stadiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| Industry standards will help with that, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| and also conversations with the team help with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| to see what they've had in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| At the current, at Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| So I guess my question is, what's the agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Maybe it has no bearing, but what's the agreement at the current stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Does the team pay for any of that at the current stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| Surely there are going to be differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| The large number of these agreements as capital repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| are on the community and not on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Like right now, Titan Stadium is reaching the end of its economic life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| and the amount of money that is going to be needed to keep the Titans there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| is going to be very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| And so, yes, a minor league baseball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| the main things that happen with NFL stadiums are they want to modernize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| their things for the type of suites and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| and that change, I mean, there wouldn't be the same level of capital repairs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| But I was looking at Doug, because I'm sure he would tell us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| I mean, based on their experience in Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| that he could probably develop a pretty accurate capital repair program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| over the life of the stadium, because they've been there 20-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6613)|

| 1:50:44| What have other people's capital repairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Like the city has done this, like, with the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| The hockey team wanted things to happen, the auditorium, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| and we had to decide what we could and couldn't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| We didn't get the makeover we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| We added some stuff, but we couldn't do everything, and that's a 1960s facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| I hope I'm correct on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| So, yeah, I think there's a lot more conversation to be had on ongoing expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| just like, you know, we own a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I mean, when it gets an oil leak and we have to fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| what's that look like to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Where's it coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| Thanks, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| and I think that speaks to every piece of infrastructure that either of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| governments are responsible for is that that's a key, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| piece of information that we put together in order to make plans for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| financial future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| So we'll get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| So from an economic development standpoint, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| we have been desperate as we look forward to expand the tax base in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| to meet the growing needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| And, you know, Mr. Mamentov,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| we talked about $100 million-plus investment directly around the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| which doesn't even begin, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| to touch the opportunity of the added development that will take place as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6740)|
| 1:52:29| radius grows with private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| So for me, you know, that would potentially be in the hundreds of millions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6753)|
| 1:52:40| which to me is a pretty remarkable ROI for this project and this investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| and exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| With that said, I'm just curious if there has been any discussion on any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| programs that would aid, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| or ensuring that there is benefit for the current property owners or residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| within that area to help minimize any displacement or, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| to ensure that, you know, as their properties rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| that there is a benefit and advantage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| I'm happy to take that, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| So I think just so that everybody heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| the question was about the kinds of programs that could be put together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| ensure that current property owners are able to stay and are not displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| So a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| I think, first of all, I appreciate hearing that because I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| something that others and members of the sports authority have also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| you know, brought to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| We have programs existing in the city that help with home ownership and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| owner-occupied rehab that help people stay in their homes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| I mean, that's a drop in the bucket, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| compared to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| So I think that, A, it's something we need to be mindful of and we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| if you have ideas, we would be happy to think about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| I think, B, one of the things that we're finding is that there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| property owners who have already said, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| we see this as an opportunity to make a little bit of money on our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| you know, manufacturing facility, our warehouse facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| and we actually wanted to move because we needed some new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| infrastructure in order to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| And so they're seeing this as an opportunity to help expand their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| business by relocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| So there's a mixture of needs in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| We're hearing from some folks who may be looking for, say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| facade grant improvements to move to another location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| and we're certainly, you know, continuing to explore that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| I think this is just going to be an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| We've got a group that's looking at housing needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| and I think that the commercial property needs are starting to come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| as well, and those are questions that we welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| Mr. Smith from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Do we still have Mr. Cohen with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| I've asked him to hang on, but that's what, yeah, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6921)|

| 1:55:25| There he is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| IT team, could we pull up his screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| Well, we don't want to waste your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| I'm glad you stayed with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| The analysis that you provided related to the economic impact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| significant, and I just was curious whether you ran any numbers for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| alternative, so if this project doesn't go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| what does a wholly private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| how does it impact the local economy as compared to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| So the economic impact numbers that we are showing are net new to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| economy, so that is the actual impact of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| given its presence in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| So if that stadium was not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| then you could theoretically lose out on that much amount of economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Well, I guess my question is more around the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| because I think that property will be developed somehow if this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| doesn't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| I believe we'll look very similar, obviously, without public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| What is the financial impact of just private development in this square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6990)|
| 1:56:37| footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Obviously you don't have a specific project to compare this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| but surely there's a benchmark we could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Yeah, we would generally, yeah, I don't want to give you a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| I don't know a specific number because we did not model it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| I will say that generally projects for sports are more net new to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7009)|
| 1:56:57| economy than just general development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| General development can happen anywhere in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| so the percentage of the spending related to the private development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| less than the amount of spending that would be net new relative to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| So I think opportunity cost-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| the private development would probably have net new economic impacts of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| little bit lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| But again, I do not have specific numbers for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| and it would really depend on the actual makeup of the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| For instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| if that private development that gets put in is 85% of it is retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| then maybe there will be way more spending happening in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| area than there would be even for a minor league baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7061)|
| 1:57:47| So it would really depend on the actual makeup of the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| So if it was, for instance, a bunch of office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| the rent of which is not taxable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| then you would lose out on the potential fiscal and economic impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| related to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| So it does depend a lot on the makeup of the particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| but I don't want to give you a specific answer as to which one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| actually better, because I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Thanks for hanging with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| I'll be here until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Stick with it, Mr. Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| We have a question from the other Mr. Smith from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| Yeah, while we have him, I want to go ahead and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| Looking at the economic impact summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| the mixed-use direct impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| while this mixed-use site is within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| you have the impact being greater in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| Could you please explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| Yeah, so these are cumulative impacts of construction and operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| So purely on the operational side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| the city impacts will be larger than the county impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| because the city is smaller than the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| However, all of the construction happens within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| county, and state, and all of the construction is net new to all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| But a larger portion of the construction spending happens in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| than it happens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| So essentially the county starts out with more net new impacts from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| construction than the city does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| because more of the spending of construction happens within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| than it does in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| And then over time, as operations happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| the city begins to catch up to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| In this particular instance, over 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| the city didn't catch up all the way to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| just because the operations were a little bit smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| But if we took this out to, instead of 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| we took it out to 40 or 50 or 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| the operational difference between the city and the county would become a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| little more evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| But because of the head start that the county got by having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| construction costs in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| they ended up with total output a little bit larger than the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| So because the project is developed in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| the construction costs are contributed to the county as gains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| Right, because the city is inside the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| And a certain portion, we'd say, I'm just saying, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| maybe 20% of the materials for the construction are spent within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| but maybe in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| it's closer to 35 or 40% of the materials are spent in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| So there's a larger proportion of the construction spending happening in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| which gives them a head start on the total output,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| the net new total output relative to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| Over time, in terms of the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| the city would be ahead of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| But in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| the head start that the county got from construction was large enough to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| after 30 years, to still be ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| I'm going to go to Mr. Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| and then I'm going to come back around and hit some of our new speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| So Mr. Roberto, because I think you have a question for Mr. Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Yeah, I have a follow-up question for Mr. Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| We've had a lot of really good discussion today about revenue and economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| And obviously at the center of that are your models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| And so I wanted to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| could you talk about the model that you use to set this up and how it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| performed when you test it against, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| things that happen because obviously we're looking at projections here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| not actuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| So could you talk a little bit about the models and how reliable they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| been? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| So the model that we set up is based off of various assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| looking at other double-A ballparks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| as well as other USL soccer teams that we've had experience in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| So the report that you guys have is a buildup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| or at least contains the buildup of a variety of assumptions that inform our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| model, whether we're looking at total attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| or we're looking at naming rights, revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| or things of that nature, concessions per caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| merchandise per caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| all that spending is in line with what we've seen at around the country in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| terms of other, other stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| So the model takes each individual assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| whether it be the attendance or the average ticket price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| or the number of luxury suites that are in there and how much they cost and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| what their sell through is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| And we take each individual piece of the puzzle and bring it into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| financial proforma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Now financial proforma informs our economic impact assumptions and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| economic impacts assumptions are driven off of all of that gross spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| which we then convert into net new spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| And then we use the multipliers to get to the total output.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| So all of the different assumptions that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| we have a specific reason for each individual piece of the model based off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| of comparable benchmarking across the league,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7370)|

| 2:04:51| So the approach is going to be different when public funds are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7491)|

| 2:05:04| which is why I'm going to turn to my friend to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7504)|

| 2:05:10| But I think I did just want to make sure that everyone is aware that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7510)|

| 2:05:35| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7535)|

| 2:06:24| resources that we need to try to maximize opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7584)|

| 2:08:45| just a basic question for now about property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| I don't have this figure right in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7727)|

| 2:08:50| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| the proposed site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| which is currently in private hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| how much property tax revenue is that generating currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| I think roughly city and County each get a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| between 30 and $35,000 a piece off that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| off those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7750)|

| 2:09:14| This is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| a follow up question about why the County gets more construction funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| because I looked around the room and it looked like a lot of us were kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| confused about how that possibly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| So if someone could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| explain that a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| I would like to make a guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| but that's always dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Is it because most construction supplies are bought outside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| how do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| how did we come up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Brian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| are you still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| So we looked at other projects across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| so whether how much of the materials and supplies ends up staying within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| the city and the County limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| So it's not that the County would get more than the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| It's that because the city is within the County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| but we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| we would say maybe 20% of the construction costs end up staying within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| but because the County is just larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| it will end up getting more construction costs in general from firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| that are outside of the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| but still within the County limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| I think that was sort of my question that a lot of people who may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| contractors and doing work on this project are physically located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| outside the city limits in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| in comparable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7836)|
| 2:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| In,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| in other comparable stadiums that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| that is the case where there is a larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| or at least a significant portion of them is within the County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| but not within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| Um, so we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| we do adjust for that and then on the same level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| there is more construction costs and materials that are within the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| that are with not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| not within the County or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| That made sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| but I would like to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| If it pleases the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| I'm going to call on the lights that are currently on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| and then I'm going to move to public forum because we have members of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| If we have more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| we can then determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| do we want to come back or take those questions offline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| I want to make sure before people have to leave for the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| they have an opportunity to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| to speak to their elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| So I'm going to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| I have one question here that was submitted 30 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| who owns the stadium and who will assume the capital improvements if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| there is not a new lease with a new team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| Sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| So the sports authority as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| as a quasi governmental entity will be the owner of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| which is just to clarify that there'll be the owner of the stadium from day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| It's just going to be subject to a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| And so when the lease expires at the end of 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=7911)|
