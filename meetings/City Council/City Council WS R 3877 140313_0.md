| 0:01:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Hello, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| This is a different perspective to be looking at you from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| I haven't been here in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| It's scary, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| I get to keep an eye on all of you, so this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| So thank you, Council, for holding this workshop to review the new draft homelessness plan that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=95)|
| 0:01:43| As you all know, this plan is a product of a long process to coordinate and to strengthen collaborative efforts in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| You all know the history over the past several years with the successes and the controversies of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness that began in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=110)|
| 0:02:00| That effort was eventually suspended and was followed by a very good public process called Compassion Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| in which through 43 public meetings and online comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| more than 500 individuals provided ideas and insights about how to address homelessness in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| In 2012, I formed the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness, consisting of executives of major stakeholder service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=139)|
| 0:02:28| And I want to thank also Councilman Finbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| He served on the roundtable representing the council, and I appreciate his participation in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| The purpose of the roundtable was to reinvigorate the collaboration among the stakeholders, agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| and ministries who provide services and shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| And those collaborations had really started with the 10-year plan several years before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| We also wanted to develop a new homeless plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| This new plan would be a collaborative product of all of these partners that would build upon what we had learned over the past seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| and what we learned from those who participated in Compassion Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| So we relied heavily on the Compassion Knoxville report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| We also wanted to be mindful of new federal priorities and requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| and we wanted to set meaningful goals and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| The roundtable has met four times so far, and there have been eight subcommittee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| So altogether, there have been 12 meetings for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Each goal and strategy in this plan has been vetted during these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| and numerous revisions have circulated among all the various partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| One thing that I wanted to make clear at the very beginning was that my intention was not to have a city government plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| that we handed out to stakeholders to implement or that we alone would implement as city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| My intention was to have a plan that was developed together by all the partners and the city based on our individual experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| and what we were individually willing to do or able to do, and again, what was learned from Compassion Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| So the plan would set a vision with goals and strategies that together we would all work to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| So actually, as we vetted these one by one, line by line, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| now really, don't just say, okay, challenge this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Is this really something that we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Is this something that you think needs to be done in our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| And so we had that kind of a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I said, you need to own this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Don't let your name be signed on here if you don't really own this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| if you don't think this is the right thing for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| So the members of the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness agreed with this collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| and I want to recognize them, again, for the many, many hours that they and their staff contributed to the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| Many of those members are here, so if you are a member of the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| or if you helped staff that for your boss, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Yes, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| I also want to recognize, and the whole list of partners are in the plan, I think, on the last page of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| I also want to recognize city staff who worked staffing all of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| and doing a lot of the writing, and the major part of that was done by our own Mike Dunthorne from the Office on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=323)|
| 0:05:32| He really gave it his all and has been working with all of the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| And also, of course, his boss, Becky Wade, and her boss, Bill Lyons, and all of the city staff who participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| I'd like to recognize them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| So we released a draft of the proposed plan on January 2nd of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| and we held a public meeting on February 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Many of you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Around 70 people attended, and they made 34 comments or suggestions or asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| And we also received 11 e-mail responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| And you have copies of all those comments that we have received on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| To me, this plan makes sense because it is comprehensive with strategies to address all populations who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| not just those who are chronically homeless, but all different populations, and also those who risk being homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| It emphasizes accountability from those who need the help, from those who provide the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| and also from each other as we work together to tackle this difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| It addresses both short-term and long-term challenges for people who are homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| or at the risk of becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| In fact, prevention is one of the more dramatic objectives of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| You all know, we all know, that it's far better and less expensive for families to get a little help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| before they lose their home or apartment than it is to only respond once there is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| So some or perhaps many of these goals and strategies are already being implemented to some degree or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| with either private or public funds or by volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And remember, the city, throughout this process, when the old plan was suspended and we were working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| the city and our city budget, we have general funds that go towards homeless services, primarily case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| and all of these partners have raised millions and millions of dollars every year to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| So this has continued in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| But this whole plan is not something that we will achieve overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Resources are simply not available at this time to fully implement all of the goals and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| It is a comprehensive plan that will be implemented as additional private, public, and volunteer resources become available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| We know now what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| We know where the gaps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| The plan gives us direction and the framework for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| The plan will continue to evolve as needs and conditions change, and the collaborations will continue to evolve as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| And so now before I conclude and hand it over to Mike Dunthorne, who's going to take us through the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| I want to announce that there are two new members of the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| First, I invited, asked Mayor Burchett if he would appoint Dr. Martha Buchanan to serve as the county's representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| as his representative on this Roundtable, and he was happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And so Dr. Buchanan will be joining us, and we're happy to have the county's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| And we've also invited, I have invited a representative of the Homeless Collective to join the Roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| The collective consists of homeless individuals and formerly homeless who want to make a difference in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| They come together to try and advocate on behalf of the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| so we will have a representative from that collective also on the Roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| So I'm real happy about those two new additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| So now that's my introduction, and now unless you have questions for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| then I'd like Mike to go ahead and show you the highlights of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| Questions for the Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| I really appreciate your confidence as we head into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| And thank you, City Council, for your time tonight, and also many of you were at the public meeting in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| and I really appreciate the time and attention that you're giving to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| For those who were at the public meeting, this presentation will look fairly familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| It's the same plan, so we'll go through it and cover this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| As the Mayor said, we had several considerations that went into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| The Compassion Knoxville process brought quite a bit of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| and so that was very important to put into the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| We learned lessons from the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| The federal government has its Opening Doors Homelessness Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| and it actually has very similar main points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| and so we tried to mirror some of that so that we're consistent with federal programming on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| because, frankly, when we look for funding from them, they look for us to be paying attention to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| And likewise, they have the HEARTH Act, which covers a lot of the federal funding resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| and so we tried to be consistent with requirements that they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| The members of the roundtable up to this point are on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| and are in the back of the version of the draft of the plan that we released on February 2nd, or January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=643)|
| 0:10:52| This plan is focused on a set of central principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| and the first and foremost of it is just simply that homelessness is not an acceptable circumstance for anyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| And I think if we can come around and agree with that principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| that gives us the starting point to understand what it is that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| And that leads us to the second point, which is, you know, we had discussions, some robust discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| You know, the old plan was called a plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Can you really end homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| And if you adhere to the first principle, you want to at least aspire to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| It may be a long time before we can say there's zero, and maybe never we can say zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| but we can certainly make vast improvements in what we do on this issue if we're aspiring first to prevent homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| to reduce any experience that someone has, the duration of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| and to end homelessness for each individual and family when they experience it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| In this plan, we want to have accountability across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| We want to be accountable to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| We want to be accountable to the people that provide the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| whether they're taxpayers or private donors to these agencies and ministries and organizations that provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| We want to be accountable from one agency to the next, from the city to the county, and back and forth that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| so that we're working well together and making sure that we support one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| rather than do things that could tend to undermine one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| We also want the folks, we want to be accountable to the folks who need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| and we want them, to the greatest extent they are able, to be accountable back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| We want them to have skin in the game as each circumstance and each individual person works through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=760)|
| 0:12:50| And so all that together, we want to work toward a common set of achievable goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| and that's what hopefully this plan moves us toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| It's focused on these five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| We want leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| I'll go through them quickly and then go through each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| We want to improve the crisis response system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| We want to create and maintain access to a variety of decent, appropriate, affordable, permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| because it still remains the truth that housing is the antithesis of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| We want to increase economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| and we want to improve health and stability for people who are at risk or experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| And so with the first concept, leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement, it starts with political will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| and that's why it's so important to have Mayor Rejero's personal investment in this plan and in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=822)|
| 0:13:51| and people like Councilman Saunders, and like all of City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| that's why we're bringing this to you, because it's important that you come to this on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| so as we work through this plan, we all have this common starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| We want collaboration, as I mentioned before, among all these different folks that we want accountable to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| and we want to work well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| We want civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| We don't want this to be just the city plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| We don't want this just to be agencies doing their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| We want everybody stepping up and playing whatever role is appropriate for each person and each organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| and that includes people who are already at the table from faith-based organizations, businesses, and civic organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| We want to invite people into this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| The crisis response system, we want to continue to improve that crisis response system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| That's sort of the most visible thing that people think about and see when they think about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| and there are things that are underway and more things that we can do to improve that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| Certainly prevention is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| We have things like, I think you're all familiar with the prevention case management program that we helped to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=905)|
| 0:15:14| providing case management in four KCDC high-rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| We had a population there that we know is potentially at risk of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| and we can provide resources that are going to keep them housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| We want to look at things like the IBM Smarter Cities concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=926)|
| 0:15:36| where we're looking at how do you get ahead of the curve with weatherization and energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| to make sure that people don't lose their housing because of high utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| What can we do to get ahead of that curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| In the public comments, there was actually an idea that was brought forward that I think is a great idea that we hadn't quite gotten to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| and that was what about involving active military organizations in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| in helping to prevent homelessness for future veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| There may be some ways that we can use those resources to identify people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| and provide assistance and interventions that will prevent people from becoming homeless after they're discharged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| Those things are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| We want to focus on things like rapid rehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| which is the term in the business of trying to help people who are homeless to as quickly as possible get back into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=984)|
| 0:16:35| and receive the services that they need to stabilize them there and move them forward quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| so they don't spend too much time sort of languishing in homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| and making it more difficult to end that situation and to get stabilized again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| We want effective coordination of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Things like the Crossroads Center at CARM are really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| because it brings people into that center that are not CARM agencies or CARM employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| They coordinate with others, bring them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| and help connect people going through their system to resources that are going to move them out of the rescue mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| and emergency shelter and into long-term programs and into housing stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| And then finally, we want to make sure that we're not doing a one-size-fits-all approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| and so there are targeted programs and opportunities for specific populations like families, veterans, the elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| people with addiction or mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| And so we want to make sure that we keep those things focused to the right needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| and get the people with those needs to those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| We want to create and maintain access to a variety of decent, appropriate, affordable permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| There's a lot in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| We want to maintain and improve the existing housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| and part of that is looking at how do we implement livability standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| We kind of rest right on the edge in extremely affordable housing, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| where the rent can be very low, but the housing standards are very low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| and we get into situations where keeping that rent low can end up creating substandard housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| or endorsing substandard housing, and then that substandard housing eventually gets condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| People lose their housing quickly, and then agencies and city resources get expended trying to relocate those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| So how do we get ahead of the curve on situations like that to make sure that there's a baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| for affordable existing housing stock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| We want to do things like work with the low-income housing tax program at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| and our local interaction with it to find ways to incentivize people using that resource to develop affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1130)|
| 0:18:58| We want to look at any local barriers to affordable housing, things that may be in our own system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| that make it more difficult to create and maintain affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| And then, again, we do have special debt to military veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| and so we want to make sure we're taking opportunities like the federal HUD-VASH program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| which provides case management tied to a voucher for a military veteran to get them into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| and provide, through the Veterans Administration, social services to stabilize them in that housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| So we want to make sure we take advantage of those programs because the VA has a very forward commitment to try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| as we say, end homelessness among veterans in a very short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| So we want to take advantage of those resources to serve those veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| and then when we direct veterans into those programs, that frees up other resources that can be applicable to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1189)|
| 0:19:59| We want to continue to work with the faith community for things like the Circles of Support program at Compassion Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| that provides mentors for people who have been placed into permanent housing and other things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| that can help stabilize people once they move out of homelessness and into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| and give them the reconnection to the community that they need to help them stay where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| Economic security, this sort of has two sides of, well, two-and-a-half sides to a coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| We want to make sure that job training and placement programs are brought into specialized services for the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| and that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| We want to make sure it happens more and more consistently so that those services are brought to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| who are experiencing homelessness and offered to them to help them break out of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| And likewise, we want to make sure the mainstream resources of that nature that are available to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| that people can get to them and understand what they are and figure out how to navigate that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| And then sort of the other side of the coin is the issue that there are some people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| because of a mental illness or a physical disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| are not likely ever going to be able to work that 40-hour-a-week job that can pay for their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| Those folks are going to be eligible for things like SSI and SSDI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| and so we want to take advantage of programs like there's something called SOAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| that increases the likelihood that somebody who is eligible is going to get a positive result from their application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| and it will happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| And taking advantage of that means that that person has income that can pay for their housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| can help pay for their food and other things that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| so that we're not then looking for a grant to provide those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| And so we want to make sure people have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Finally, health and stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| We want to integrate primary and behavioral health care services with homeless assistance programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| We have Cherokee health systems working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| They're right on Fifth Avenue now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| They've got a new facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| We're working with Helen Ross McNabb for behavioral health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| and we're trying to make sure that those resources are integrated with the services that are available to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| so that those connections are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| We want to advance health and housing stability for very specific populations, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| making sure we're not doing one-size-fits-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| We want to take advantage of programs like when Lakeshore closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| They've provided financial resources that help people who are receiving inpatient care that are homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| or are going to leave that inpatient care and be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| There are resources to help make sure that they get connected with housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| so they don't just end up back on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| We want to work with the Affordable Care Act in whatever way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| to make sure people who are eligible for that can receive that type of resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| We want to coordinate with the proposed safety center to the extent that it makes sense with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| and that the results of that help people divert from that system and get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| And so all of those things can help improve health and stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Also, one thing I forgot to mention is coordinating with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| They have a whole set of goals and things that align with what we're trying to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| and so we want to make sure we're on their radar and they on ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| Back in coordination of services, one thing that I neglected to mention that I can't not mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| and that is the importance of the Homeless Management Information System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| which I think all of you have probably heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| UT College of Social Work coordinates that service for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| All of the major providers are participating in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| We're trying to continue to expand it to additional secondary providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| so that we understand what's going on in this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| It can provide referrals from one agency to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| It can provide accountability from all of these different agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| It can provide internal accountability for each agency that uses it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and we're very fortunate in this community to have the system operating the way it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| and the participation at the level that we have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| because it's sort of the core of how we're going to keep this entire program accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| And so with that, I've kind of zipped right through this and we can get to questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| As the mayor said, the draft plan was released on January 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| We had public comments online and at the public meeting in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| We're now at the city council workshop, and hopefully in a few weeks we might be able to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| if you're willing to adopt this plan as the city of Knoxville's response to homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Mayor and Mike, thank you very much for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| I want to emphasize this is not the city plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| This is a plan that was literally, as the mayor said, grown out of all of the providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| all of the folks that were mentioned earlier that formed the mayor's roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| to come with a plan that we think is doable, and much of it is already in place and working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| and we simply want to enhance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Also, this is not a static plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| This will be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| By necessity, it will be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| And as we grow and have whatever experience, we will adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| So I think this is worthy of our consideration and hopefully adoption when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| Mr. Mayor, Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I appreciated the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I'm curious, I haven't heard anything about cost or costs associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Have you analyzed that in any way so that we have some sense of what level of commitment you're suggesting to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| as part of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| I think the first answer to that question is simply that this plan is a framework for us to make those types of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| As the mayor mentioned, there are things in this plan that we're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| There are things that we hope we can do in the very near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| and there are other things that we may not have the resources for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| and we'll have to set aside for the early portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Sort of a goal strategy of what we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| It's a set of goals and a framework for us to work through the processes that we need to do to look at funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| It gives you as City Council a starting point to look at those funding questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| and it's our hope that other philanthropic organizations and resources for financing things in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| will also use it to help them make decisions and prioritize what they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| And I'll answer that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Again, this is not something that the city will fund the entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| That is not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| This is a community plan that represents all the different actions that are being taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| or that we as a community hope that somebody will take in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| And so as we move along, I know as I'm preparing a budget, I look at what federal dollars do we have available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| what local dollars might we allocate to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| and then I would, if I recommend additional funding for this current budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| then I will tell you what part of this plan I would propose to put additional funding into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| But it does not require us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Adoption of this plan does not require us to fund a specific amount for a specific program at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| But it leads us as we analyze what are we able to do from city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| and where would we focus our resources if we were going to put in additional dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| then this would be the framework for how I would make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| and then that recommendation to you all in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| And likewise, the other members of the roundtable, the other members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| a lot of them are funding these activities right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| This gives them some guides as they raise additional funds or as they set a goal to take it to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| They've got the general strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| We know who's doing what and where the gaps are, and so we'll try and fill those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Well, and I appreciate at the core coordinating and not duplicating services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| has been an important achievement all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I mean, that makes a lot of sense using the HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| And, you know, I know we provide help towards the caseworker efforts and the counseling efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| I just didn't know if we had some sense of how deep the pool is before we jumped in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| and I was just curious if you had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Well, I want to say that I think it's great to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I think that's the hardest part is putting it down in black and white and having a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| so we can take shots at it and anybody can take shots at it and look for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| So I think that's the hardest part, and that was a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| You answered and said what I say, that I think it gives us an opportunity when we look for budget items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| or we're asked to support funding a particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| so we can go back and measure it up against this plan as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Is that part of what we looked at in 2014, and does that meet our objectives and our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| and does that meet the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| So I think it's a great place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| A lot of it is going to be the ability to bring the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| and match it up with the private dollars and how to leverage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| And that's going to be the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| And I would say to Mr. Dunthorne, that's going to be the challenge right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| is how to bring these private dollars to the table to look at the housing piece, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| That's going to be a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| And what can we do to make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| So I applaud you for the plan and applaud you for the roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| I think it's important that that group continue to meet two or three times, four times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| to talk about the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| That's how you bring the collaboration, and I think that's an important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| And based on the people I've talked to, I would say that they think that's a very important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1857)|
| 0:31:05| So, anyway, I think it's good, and we'll continue to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Both to the Mayor and Mike and the roundtable, again, yeah, we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| and I echo what my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Mayor, one of the things that I would be interested in seeing is a breakdown of what the city does put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| in terms of dollars in the different programs, because I know there's different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| and this sort of thing, and I'd be interested in that, as well as what the federal dollars are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| and whether there's county dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| In other words, just a breakdown of what is being spent and what we do spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| because I think a lot of times we get criticized that we don't spend anything for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| and I think it would be good if we had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I can share some of that with you right now, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Currently, unfortunately, a lot of the federal dollars are no longer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| In the past, we had significantly more CDBG dollars than we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| During the stimulus funding, we had what was called HPRP, Homeless Prevention and Rapid Rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1922)|
| 0:32:13| I should know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| I was the Director of Community Development at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| We had the Neighborhood Stabilization dollars, which funded our portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| which is less than 20%, I believe, of Menvilla and of Flinnican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| We had HOME dollars, which is for affordable housing, and the Emergency Solutions grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| So we've had a lot of funding in the past, and then city general dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| So on this current budget year, we have, from the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| we have emergency solution grant funds of $130,000, which are granted out to many of our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| For the coming year, they changed the funding guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| and so we no longer will get a direct allocation of ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| What formally came to us will go to the state, and then we have to apply to the state in order to get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| So we, of course, will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| We're not sure exactly how much, if we will get the whole $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| We anticipate less than that from the state, and there will be probably a six-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| So that's unfortunate news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| From the general fund, we currently spend $125,000 a year for case management services at the KCDC high-rises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2001)|
| 0:33:32| and that is a grant that goes to CAC to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| We also have $50,000 in grant funds to fund case management at Flinnican for the chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| and $50,000 for the same at Menvella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| And then we put roughly, I didn't check exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| but it's roughly $100,000 a year into the Office on Homelessness to support staff and operating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| In addition, we receive, we manage $1.3 million in federal dollars for the continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2039)|
| 0:34:09| We coordinate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Mike does that from his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Those are funds that go to partners in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| So those are the dollars that come through the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Have I left anything out currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Significantly less than we've had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| because the federal dollars that were quite plentiful previously are no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Michael, what about engagement in the faith-based community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, what's the outreach there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| Well, the first thing I would say about that is it's important to note that the faith-based community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| has always been on the front lines and has always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| So when we talk about engaging the faith-based community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| I don't want anyone to think that we're saying that they haven't been there in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| I think that's in large part about not only working with the existing ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| and organizations that are currently part of the roundtable and doing that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| but also trying to work with the faith community to help even simple things like people in Sunday school classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| that say, hey, I want to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I want their first thought to be, how do I plug into this coordinated effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| and do something that helps really move the entire community down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| perhaps instead of the more typical response, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| I'll make some sandwiches or do something like that, which is a good thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| but I think there are ways that we can reach out to the faith community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| and help them plug into this system in a more structured way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And so we'll be working with folks like the Compassion Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| who have all these member churches, to reach out and doing anything like that that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| just to communicate with folks and help them plug into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| You know, I think you make a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| And I generally, when I talk about helping, it seems like it's, you know, from the hip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| and it's well intended, but it doesn't seem to be, and maybe I'm missing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| a lot of structure and a lot of, well, just a lot of structure and direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| and sustaining a long-term how they play in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And that varies, and really that's just a microcosm of the broader thing that we're trying to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| because all of us are trying to figure out how can we work better together to improve the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| And one other question I have, and then we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Did you say that you are partnering with the VA to help with the veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| And so can you tell me a little bit more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Well, I'm regularly in communication with the VA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| You know, I've worked with them, and they really have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| they and KCDC have done the work on making sure that programs like HUD-VASH are applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| and come to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| There's another program called the Supportive Services for Veterans Families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| that's being provided not only in Knox County but throughout the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| that helps provide some immediate intervention for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| And so I try to work with them to help them make sure that those resources are brought to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| And so that interaction is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Well, I commend you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| I think you've done a great job, and it seems really organized and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| And, you know, you've done a great job of bringing it forward to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| and letting everybody have a bite of it, as George said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And I think that that's, you know, to be commended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| and that's the way to go about a large, difficult problem as this is in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| Let me go to Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| He hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| And then Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| First of all, I want to say I thank the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| You've had many meetings working on this, and it's a major step, I think, in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| because it's a major problem across our country trying to deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| And I wanted to ask you in terms of the veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| do you have any numbers in terms of the numbers of homeless veterans that we have here in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| I think that we're consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| It's a rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| We're consistent, I think, with the national figures on that where it's about 10 to 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2307)|
| 0:38:38| Well, if we could get you to, if you wouldn't mind to come up and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| This is our numbers guy, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| I'm not making these numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| I'm David Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I'm at the UT College of Social Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| I'm the Director of the Knoxville Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| That said, 11%, last year there were 9,806 individuals who received services for homelessness in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2338)|
| 0:39:12| or in Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| That includes people who are actively homeless, people who are at risk of being homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| and people who are housed and receiving supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| Of that total, 11% were veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| And also I hope as we go forward, and, Mayor, you mentioned that Dr. Buchanan has been added to the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| that the county will come on board with the plan because in order for it to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| it's going to really take the city and the county to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| So I hope that they will come on board with the plan in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| We also want to remember the county puts $5 million a year into indigent care for individuals in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| and which also then would be just many of the homeless would be covered as well under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| So, yes, we want them at the table helping us coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| And, again, I want to make the point, again, that most of the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| most of the work being done to address this issue is done by the partners, not by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| You know, we are a small, tiny portion of it, but as mayor and as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| our job is really to convene these partners to help with the collaboration to promote these efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| and to recognize what's being done and to work together to, you know, to address the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| I, too, applaud the work of everyone who's been involved in bringing this to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| Probably one of the most heartening things is that people are really talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| but more importantly listening to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| And all the stakeholders seem to be buying in or on the verge of buying in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| And as I read through the draft of the plan, there were very many encouraging pieces for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| And I think the public really wants accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| They really want to understand what's going on, where the dollars are going, how it's being helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| And I think that this process this time is a real step forward in looking ahead and answering questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2484)|
| 0:41:34| getting something really specific in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| So I applaud the efforts of everybody who's been involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Councilman DeLvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| One of the questions I had was, in the presentation, you were talking about training and job placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| Could you elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Because I know a lot of our citizens like to see sort of a hand up rather than the hand out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| if we can help people get stabilized on their feet and become a productive member of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| We have people that have mental illnesses or addictions that may or may not be curable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| But there are some percentage of these folks that have fallen on hard times for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| And your all's history talks about, you know, various situations where someone loses a job, has an illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| something occurs and throws them into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| So could you talk a bit about how do we get people restored back to functioning in the society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| and what we're doing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| There are some different programs already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| For instance, Salvation Army has their Operation Bootstrap program that brings folks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| and tries to work with them both on underlying issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| and get them connected with employment resources at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| The Rescue Mission has their Abundant Life Kitchen program that provides culinary training for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| And then other programs are simply as part of getting people set up with their case plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| and getting people to see that path out of homelessness involves helping them connect with resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| like the Career Center and the state-funded job training and placement programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| And so this plan is looking at how do we make sure that we're being as effective as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| connecting people with those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| To be honest, I find a lot of those resources confusing myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| and so I can only imagine somebody who's dealing with a life crisis at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| is going to find that challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| And so we want to make sure that we're being as deliberate as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| to make sure those resources are accessible to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I remember one of our community groups had a meeting at Jobs for Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| which was over in Mechanicsville, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Are they being plugged in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| In other words, we've got a state agency whose whole focus is trying to get people into the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| in a way that helps them, you know, overcome the gaps of how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| put together a little resume or proposal and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Are we tying into those organizations that are funded by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| Yes, we actually had somebody from the state help us as we were working through the working groups on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| And I guess we want to elucidate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Yes, we want to make sure that they are at the table and connecting people to those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| And my other question was, in the past, there was a certain amount of frustration, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| that the service industries doing this were concentrated in what we call the mission district along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2682)|
| 0:44:52| How do you see that changing or evolving over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| In other words, as you go forward under this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| are we going to be in a situation of concentrated homeless folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| or are we going to find other ways to sort of help mitigate that concentration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| Well, at its baseline, this plan is about getting people out of homelessness and back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| So I really don't want to see concentrated homeless people on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| because I want to get them off the streets and I want to get them into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| and I want them to be throughout the community and a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| So certainly my vision for this plan, and I think others share it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| is that we make sure that we're doing what we can to bring people back into the community in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Any other questions by Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Is there anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| No one signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Is there anyone from the audience who would like to address this or have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| Could you give your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Vivian Scheidt, 612 Clyde Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| One thing that I like the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I've dissected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I think it's a good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Two concerns that I have is that, and it's already been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| is that we really get some structure and some direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| and some collaboration with the faith-based organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Not just always the groups that we are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| but let's go out here and get some of the other organizations and have them come aboard also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| The other thing that I had with the bootstrap program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I also would like to see, as we develop this program, that funds be directed to those men that are over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| If you know of work or there's programs that you concentrate getting them jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| so that you're automatically getting these people employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| and moving them out so that other people can move in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Because you've got to get, I think, about 50 is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| But there needs to be a structured plan to work with that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| These men are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| They're ready to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Let's get some monies going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| You want a flow of people moving up and moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| That is one area, I think, that we really need to put some concentration on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| But the faith-based really is something we really need to also concentrate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| But I am for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I have been following it, and I am really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| We're glad that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| For the business, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Before we do that, is there a timetable that we're going forward on this, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| We're taking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| This will be on your agenda for April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| So it will be on the council agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140313?start=2859)|
