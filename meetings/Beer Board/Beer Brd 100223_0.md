| 0:07:11| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| One of their applicants has not been in for processing, so I'm not sure we would even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=432)|

| 0:08:53| Target Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=533)|
| 0:09:03| Hello, I'm Brian Calvert, 324 Quail Point Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| We're waiting on building inspector approval and fire inspector approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| I have a question for Mr. Calvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| I believe this is a first-time permit for this Target store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| And this beer board is always very concerned about sales to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| and I see that you have gone through the task class with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| which is certainly a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Can you tell this board, obviously you're a large operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| and I'm sure you have quite a large number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| What kinds of safeguards do you intend to put into place to make certain that you are not selling to underage people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| At the point of sale at Target, we have a register lockdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Anything that is scanned that requires a driver's license immediately shuts the register down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| and we call for a supervisor as well as looking at the identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| So before it's even passed through and paid for, we have that lockdown is what Target would call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| And so the supervisor is ultimately the one that makes the decision whether or not to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| And is there ongoing training with your supervisors for this kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Target will go through its own training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| They'll have an alcohol training, and then all the supervisors will go through Target training as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| But, again, is that a one-time event, or is there ongoing refreshers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| It's ongoing refreshers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Any new cashier that's assigned enters Target will go through the training as well as any new management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=640)|
| 0:10:51| The super Target that's in Knoxville, all the supervisors go through the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| It's a yearly thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| We would be following that same rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Well, we're glad to have you in Knoxville, but please know we're very serious about no sales to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Yeah, quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I think it's a great question, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| When the clerk scans it, shuts down, does the clerk have even the technical ability to punch anything in and override that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| Or does it have to be a supervisor with some special secret, whatever only they've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| It would be a supervisor passcode that only the supervisor would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| It would be the same thing as if you were to purchase Nicorette through Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| The Nicorette would scan, and it would immediately stop and ask for a supervised override,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| and then they would check the identification and punch in the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| So further questions of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| If not, we do have a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Those like signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| You'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Mark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=714)|
| 0:12:03| Hi, I am Fatima Nanavati, 4615 Peppermill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| This question, I guess, is either for Mr. Husky or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| We know that when we approved the permit for the smoke and beer discount that was formally at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| we had some extended discussion because the property is zoned RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| and it's rather unusual to have a beer permit in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| And help me remember what our discussion was and why this was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| and are we obligated to continue selling beer at this location because now it's a preexisting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| This is not necessarily a preexisting, nonconforming situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| This is a situation where under RP1 there are certain commercial operations that are permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| and it's in Article 4, Section 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| You can see what they'll have to qualify under the zoning code for those commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| but there are commercial uses that are permitted in an RP1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| So if the beer permit is approved tonight, what happens next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| Does this go to MPC to ascertain that this use is allowable under RP1, or has that already happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| I do not know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| My best guess is that it gets approved and it's like everything else in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| You have to properly comply with your zoning, and if you don't comply with your zoning, you're subject to zoning enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| You know, this property is very close to Pond Gap School, and it's adjacent to some neighborhood areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| There's a home across the street that we had a rezoning with a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| It's gradually kind of turning over to office in this area, but it's kind of a unique situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and I just want to make sure that we're covering our bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| So your sense is if this is approved, then codes and zoning are the ones in charge of making sure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| I mean, I guess what I don't have is at what point does the exception for an allowable use in RP1 happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=841)|
| 0:14:11| The fact that we grant a beer permit does not say that you have the zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| You still have to qualify for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| And, you know, we do a zoning check to see whether the zoning area is an area within which this type of operation can be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=857)|
| 0:14:27| But beyond that, we historically don't do a check beyond that, which is not to say that it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| It's to say that that's not a part of our usual process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| So if you wanted to, for example, postpone this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and ask someone from codes enforcement to go out and see whether it qualifies under RP1 for a commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| that's something that you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| That's within the prerogative of the board to decide to do that if they don't want to go forward with issuing a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| Ms. Day, does the zoning come through your office, you know, when you let us know that the file is complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Does that include a review of the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| We just get a statement from MPC as to what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Which is in here, right, but it doesn't really address that sort of gray area of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| Unless there's been some special request or action taken, I don't know why we would have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Mr. Huskey, do you have anything to add about this particular location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| I think there's a liquor store in the same shopping center, I believe, that's been there for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| That's the end of my questions for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| We would still need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=948)|

| 0:16:16| Officer Huskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=976)|

| 0:16:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Mr. Masters, this is the city WeCourse, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| For young people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| There's pretty much two basic organizations at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| There's the First Tee Program, which is based in our upstairs part, and then we are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| WeCourse at Williams Creek, which is a public golf facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| So we are separate from the First Tee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Mr. Bailey, Golf Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Does this make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| I mean, it just hit me a little funny, but I know you know the situation a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Well, we have two other city golf courses which have permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| If you'll recall, Whittles, at one point in time, we decided to pull the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| or discontinue the sale of alcohol because of the atmosphere and the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| It wasn't what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| It wasn't a family environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| We have since reinstated the sale of beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| Currently, if you go to a facility like this, if you check the garbage cans, there's alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| There's beer cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| And in my view, this, in fact, adds control or brings some control and not less control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1053)|
| 0:17:42| There will be supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| There will not be any beer allowed except through the pro shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| As I understand, I've talked to Scott and DeAndre a little bit about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| There's a separation from the programs, which include the First Tee program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| and then the golf sales as well as the beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| So currently, you know, you have no control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I think this will add some oversight, some supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Any beer that's on the golf course would have been sold through the golf shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| and they'll know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| So, you know, I know that doesn't sound like a good combination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| but I think it does bring in still some, you know, some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| This would be your first time having beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| I live across the street practically, and I know that that course primarily was designed to help inner city youth learn golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1112)|
| 0:18:45| And there are a lot of kids who are over there on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| So I'm somewhat concerned about it, whether or not this is really appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Because of the number of children and what it's designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| So I have my concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| We have to operate as a golf course for budgetary reasons first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| We are trying to get ourselves in a situation to where we can make budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| And it is a way to do this and to have control of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| The kids are in a don't really have access to the golf shop, per se, where the beer will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Their programming is out on the golf course, and their programming is in an upstairs part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1169)|
| 0:19:38| And we have one other after school program that's at the adaptive rec center, which is on our property, but it's in a separate building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| So there really is no access to the golf shop and the beer for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| They won't have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Well, as long as it's going to be controlled, I guess it would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| But I am concerned about it because we have a problem now with underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| That whole thing was really designed, as I understood it, for inner city use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| So you've got a two-fold thing going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Let me also add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| I am on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I mean, on the Wii course board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| And I know that what it was originally designed to be economically hadn't really been able to work exactly like we would all like it to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1223)|
| 0:20:34| So there has been a transitioning over the last two or three years to market it to all players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1234)|
| 0:20:43| And if you'll remember, during the golf course contract, we insisted on a number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| including the sharing of our city resources among the three courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| And so we're really ‑‑ this is more of an economic issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| All of the county and the city facilities, this is the only one that doesn't have beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| I hate to be in a position of promoting beer consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| but I really thought long and hard and talked to the board members and DeAndre and Scott as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| about double reinforcing all the things that you normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| And it's a matter of economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And they're dependent on us and the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| And there's outings that come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| There are a lot of groups that come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| And without beer sales there, they either bring it themselves, which they were the loser, or they just sneak it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1294)|
| 0:21:44| And we have put a lot of ‑‑ we are in the midst of putting a lot of preventative measures into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| carting every individual that walks on that golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| having our ranger do a lot of looking around the golf course and making sure things are okay while they're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1313)|
| 0:22:03| Really, that is a big concern for us, too, because we understand that we have kids on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| and it's something that we definitely, definitely do not want to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| So we will be extra, extra careful as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| What do you anticipate in your business model that this is going to generate for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| Well, some of the other ‑‑ my name is DeAndre Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| I'm the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| 780 Constitution Drive, Jefferson City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| As far as tournament goes, some of the other local golf courses here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| they do about $150,000 a year in golf tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| At the WE course, we do about $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| And part of that reason is not beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| It's just the fact that when you have an event, a tournament, a fundraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| and we tell folks, well, you know, we don't serve beer, you can't have beer out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| well, they're going to go on to the next golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| So, you know, a part of us applying for the beer application is us having an ability to compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1382)|
| 0:23:12| with some of the other golf courses in town for golf tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Some of the things that we've done, kind of preventive measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| to separate the beer from the kids in our program is we remodeled our pro shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1400)|
| 0:23:29| We met with Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| We have a great relationship with the folks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| And we remodeled our pro shop so the beer is not with the other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| soft drinks and beverages and snacks where people can get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| It's going to be behind the counter, employees only, under lock and key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| And we have a storage room now that's locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| The only person that has access to that is a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| And that stuff is done in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| So, you know, there's a number of things that we've done preventive wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| As far as the kids go, I think Scott said earlier, the kids that come in our after school program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| they're in adaptive center, which is in close proximity to the golf course, to the pro shop area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| We do run the after school program, but it's in a separate building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Then we have kids that are in the golf clinics at five other schools around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| And like Scott said, those kids are upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| The pro shop is downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| They have a separate entrance and exit that they come in and out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| They don't come down in the pro shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Their golf clubs and everything is upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| I even met with our regional director of the First T for the mid-Atlantic region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| and asked him what are some of the things that is happening at the other First T chapters as far as beer goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| He says, yeah, well, you know, the golf courses, they sell beer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| And it's not like we're kind of stepping outside of the box doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| And, you know, kind of like Mr. Bailey said, it's kind of economics where our golf operation is the golf operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1510)|
| 0:25:20| Our program is the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| We're not raising money for the golf operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| It has to stand on its own feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| So, you know, with that, it has to compete with the other local golf courses in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| But still, I mean, I hear the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| So what is the business model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| What are you going to raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| What's your anticipation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Well, we were kind of conservative as far as dollars, how much money we plan on bringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| From what I'm hearing, this is going to make you economically stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| So, I mean, you've got a business model out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| And I'm just curious as to what, you know, your model anticipates, you know, your profits from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| We're anticipating just a conservative $5,000 profit for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| This is, you know, obviously we've never sold beer before in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| It's hard for us to compare ourselves with a larger golf course because they do so many more rounds than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| So we're kind of conservative at that $5,000 in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Some of the other golf courses do about $30,000 in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Is it going to be draft beer or is it just going to be canned or canned and bottled beers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| No, it's only going to be canned, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Councilman Della Lope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Thanks to both of you for explaining this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| And I know that you're trying to run a golf course that helps kids and make it economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| I was just curious, in this pro shop area, do you buy your beverage and sit there and drink it like a 19th holder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| You take it and put it in your golf cart and go around the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Yeah, well, I've taught with some other golf courses around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| and a policy that we're going to implement at the WE courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| It's not a real big, you know, pro shop area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| They don't have that kind of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| We don't have tables and, you know, where you can sit down and kind of talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| But it's going to be, you know, out there on a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| It's not to be for drinking there in a pro shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| But we don't have sitting areas and places for people to kind of sit down and, you know, and eat food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| We don't even have food there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Yeah, I was just trying to understand the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| It might be helpful if you have some kind of either sign or in your applications that reminds members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| or certainly the adult members, that they should observe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| rules of not passing drinks to minors or anything, that this is a family facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| and you should remind them that they could be excluded from the club in the future if that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Because you said you had policing with your guard driving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| But it would be a good idea to remind them that they need to honor that on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I have a number of questions, starting from Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Could you address the zoning on this property, similar to the last permit, and how this is allowable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Well, it is zoned R1, which is a little different than the previous residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| A planned residential zone does have certain permitted commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| but the R1 zone doesn't have commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| It does have certain uses that are permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and one of the uses that's permitted on review, number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| is country clubs with 18-hole golf course having grounds of not less than 140 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| or a country club with nine-hole golf course having grounds of not less than 60 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| but not miniature golf courses or driving ranges operated for commercial purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| That's really the only use permitted on review that would be consistent with this particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Then, if you go back up to the standards, it says that accessory uses related to the principal uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| arguably a clubhouse and retail sales at a clubhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| would fall within accessory uses under country clubs or country clubs with nine-hole golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1749)|
| 0:29:18| It would certainly require an interpretation by the chief building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| to determine whether commercial sales would be an accessory use that would be permitted under R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| And, again, that use on review occurs after the permit is issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| and after this board votes on the permit and before it's released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| I don't know if the Wii course already has a use on review or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I do not know the history of the Wii course with regard to their zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and whether or not they already have a use on review in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| They certainly may, and I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| Or use on review for beer sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| No, use on review for country club with a nine-hole golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I think they're a nine-hole golf course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Country club with an 18-hole golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| I guess the greater issue for me is having a comfort level with the sales of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| as Mr. Bailey said, in an environment where there are youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| And I respect how everybody has deliberated about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| and the economic realities that we have with running our city golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| But from where I sit, particularly with my involvement with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| I just cannot support this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| The fact that the beer sales are going to be mobile from a cart out on the golf course, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| increases the potential and the possibility for sales to inappropriate folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| The fact that no food is sold at this venue, alcohol without food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| can frequently be an unfortunate combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| I think, you know, typically in youth sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| TSSAA across the state of Tennessee prohibits alcohol at youth sporting events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| whether they're a local high school basketball game or a statewide tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| because of the message that it gives to young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| even if they're not drinking when they see adults that they respect imbibing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| And I think this particular program, because of the First Tee affiliation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| has a unique place in athletics and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| And it's a city-sponsored, city-underwritten athletic venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| And for $5,000, I just can't say it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| I've been waiting for like 10 minutes to say all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| No, it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| I changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Intermixing the culture of youth with the culture of drinking on the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| I mean, I understand that piece about the different rooms and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| but both elements are on the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and it sounds like that there's already alcohol on the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| even before you're requiring a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| Now, before I was going to ask the same question that Councilman Roddy asked the Target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| the first time beer permit with Target, what your strategy is to monitor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| But I just think this is too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| And for $5,000, I think the young people are more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| And you would agree that the young people are more important than the $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| that you're going to gain from beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| It was described as an inner-city program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| and I know from my work in inner-city work that a lot of these young people are exposed to adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| handling their issues with alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| It just does not feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| It's a bad move, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| What's the breakdown on your rounds from the young people as opposed to the general public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| General public is about 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| DeAndre, would you describe, first of all, along that very same line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| 95% of the rounds the people are adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| just like it's a public golf course, you come and pay a greens fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| Would you explain the First Tee Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| and also the plan to merge the First Tee Program with other First Tee Programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Well, the First Tee Program, it's a youth golf program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| but really what it does is it uses character education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and core values to teach the game of golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Our program is very unique in the fact that we pretty much operate a facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2043)|
| 0:34:14| What Mr. Bailey was referring to as far as merging with other facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| we're trying to work out something with the First Tee of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| where we can merge our programs with the First Tee of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and not only impact the area that surrounds the Wii course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| but impact greater Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| Which golf courses are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Well, it's Concord and it's Beverly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| but the First Tee Program across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2076)|
| 0:34:45| it also partners with all of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| and also private golf courses all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| What we're doing this year was trying to grow the First Tee Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| to Whittle Springs Golf Course so we can impact the kids there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| that surround Whittle Springs as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and hopefully we would like to grow it to Knox Municipal and the Three Ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| and to some of the other local golf courses in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| That's pretty much the module that's being used all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| And when you brought the figure $5,000, is that off the sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| That's strictly off the sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| It's not associated with the additional rounds that we would pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| if beer was being sold at the Wii course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| and it's not taken into a—that's just, you know, the net from the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| not rounds that we pick up from additional rounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| and then rounds we pick up from tournaments that we would pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| And what time of the day are the First Tee Programs going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| The typical, when the kids come out to play golf in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| what time are they there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Typically, the kids are there in the mornings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| and in the afternoons during the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| After school, they're there in the springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| and spring and fall probably two to three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| And then after school program, which we said is down at the adaptive center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| those kids, they come to the adaptive center every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| but they come up to the golf course at least twice a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And would you just briefly touch on the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| from what was initially more of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| First Tee only kind of par three youth course to what it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| Well, that's one of the reasons why we're kind of unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| where we own and operate our own golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| There's a lot of expenses that go along with owning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| and operating your own golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| The way that we've done it and we're separating it out this year is a golf operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| It just has to stand on its own two feet and operate like any other golf course would operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| You know, 95 or even more percent of the rounds or business comes from golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| And so it's been difficult trying to raise money, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| the way you would fundraise for a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| People don't want to support a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| They want to support programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| So this is just a part of us, the golf operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| going into that direction of supporting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Okay, and just lastly, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| I hate to be in a position of supporting consumption, but it's a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| And I think there's a mischaracterization of what this facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2254)|
| 0:37:43| and what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| And if you haven't been there and you haven't seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| and felt that you should at least maybe look at postponing this for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| just to go over there and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Because I would never condone the commingling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| or the influencing young people in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| And let me just add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Beer set aside, we have memberships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| We have over 100 members at the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| just like most other golf courses have in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| And that's something that the spirit and the atmosphere at the WE Course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| it's a family atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| And, you know, just like any golf courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| you're going to have problems that arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| And we tend to nip those problems pretty fast, nip in the bud pretty fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| and we don't have a whole lot of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| I can't think of one situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| except when we had some people get out of hand once or twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| where we had to physically go out and, you know, not physically move them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| but we had to ask people to leave the golf course, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| But something that my superintendent at our meeting this morning said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| that all of the trash cans, we finally had a good weekend this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| The weather's hurt us bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| but there was probably more beer cans in the trash cans than there were anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Let me understand where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| We've got a lot of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| We're up against time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| So, Councilman Bailey, was there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Just two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I was just thinking about do you get a lot of church youth groups that participate over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| Yeah, programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Pretty much all the youth serving organizations on that side of town, churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| other youth serving organizations participate in our programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| My other question, really not much about the beer, but there is a house there that's converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| I got an email from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Are you all in any discussions with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| You know the house that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Are you all planning to join in with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Do you have any ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| That's kind of off of the beer sales, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| But as far as that converted house, it's a beautiful home there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Do you have any ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| It's a beautiful home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| It's a nice building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| We would love to have it, but we've got to raise the money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| So, I mean, right now, you know, this economy, it's not in our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2415)|
| 0:40:25| Councilman Brown, is that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| That's my rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Yeah, I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| I think I want to make a motion to postpone this to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| Two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| One, I tend to have a lot of respect for Mr. Bailey and his work on golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| and think there is some value in thinking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I'm also a little worried, and maybe Mr. Swanson can help me on this or Mr. Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| that we're currently sitting as the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| which is the body that reviews the technical legality of beer permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| but we're talking about issues that actually go to the city ownership of a golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| and I don't know if we're making the decision in the place it ought to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| and it feels like we ought to have some of the folks from Parks and Rec here as we discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| So I'd like to put this off and maybe suggest to Mr. Bailey that the golf committee talk about it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| because I think it is something that's got some importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| So I'm making a motion to postpone it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| That's a motion, and I want to suggest that there's probably further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| and I'll recognize Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I have sort of a compromise to think about here, and I don't know whether or not it's workable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| but what I hear you saying is that one of the places where you are losing business at the golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| are the large tournaments, and earlier in this beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| we had some folks come in front of us for special use permits for events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| The Disability Resource Center came for their Pork Q-Fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| You know, I might be comfortable with a situation where, let's say the week course starts out with two tournaments a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Maybe another group comes to you and says we want to host a tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| You come and get a special use permit where you're still able to benefit from the sales of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and they're not bringing it in, and in that kind of situation, you could even close the course to youth on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| you know, if it's a Saturday, an all-day, or an all-day Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| I know all these groups, the Heart Association and whatever, they all do their fundraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| Ms. Day, is that a possibility, that they could come for a single use permit for a special event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| And I know some organizations like the Knoxville Zoo, when they have a number of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| as long as they have that lined up ahead of time, they just have to come once for an annual special use permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| and then they say we're going to have events on these three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| That would be something that I could work with, you know, and particularly if the youth were not invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| you know, on the golf course that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| And I would think if a large organization was coming in to conduct a tournament, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| you probably wouldn't be open to the general public or to youth rounds anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| So I just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| I hate to throw a wrench in works, but there is a motion to postpone pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| If there is a second to the motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| then any other discussion other than about postponement would be out of order at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| So is there a discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Councilwoman Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Sorry, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Mr. Becker, tell me again what you think might change with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| I'm not in favor of supporting the postponement because I feel pretty strongly about my position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| but you talked about going out to visit the property, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| I think there are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| I think one, three actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| One, I think it gives us each an opportunity to understand a little more what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| Two, I think we do have a golf committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I mean, there is a committee of this body that oversees the golf courses that I think is very legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| The chairman feels strongly there's a committee there, and actually it's an interesting thing for them to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| The final one that makes me uncomfortable is, again, we are sitting currently as beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| and just the level of, you know, we clearly, if the boxes are all checked, we have to approve something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| And I feel like the place to make the decision that we want to be making is a different place than where we're sitting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| And I'm not quite sure where that is, but it feels like we get a postponement and we work some of that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| So there's some of it that's just me being a little procedurally stuck on what we do as beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Mr. Swanson, I know we're talking about the postponement, but in considering the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| one of the things Vice Mayor Becker just brought up, when I came here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| I was going to look to see if the boxes were checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And that's what we're here to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Now, this is a little different because we own the golf course, which beckons the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| what are we doing at our other recreational facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| So I think that's fair in the time of a postponement to discuss those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| Because, like I said earlier, if you go over there, it's a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| It does have a component, the First Tee Program, which is a very, very small part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| And I wouldn't have come here tonight and talked to them about preventing the sale to underage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| had I not really thought about we're here to check to see if the boxes are checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| And I think we're legally required to do that, although it is a city facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| So I'm in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Councilman DelVoco, on the postponement, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Yes, I just wanted to ask you, gentlemen, would that terribly inconvenience you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| In other words, are you okay with that if we take additional time to have it at the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| I appreciate your coming here, but it sounds like folks are suggesting that we kind of adjourn it for tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| and move on taking a look at your course and talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| Is that acceptable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| It makes it a little difficult, but whatever the committee decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Mr. Swanson, relative to Mr. Bailey's question, and I certainly respect Mr. Bailey's difficulty in this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| I mean, he's part of the golf committee, and this is tough for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| But do we not have some discretion inherent in the fact that this is an R1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| Are the boxes being checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| As a beer board, you are sitting in your administrative quasi-judicial capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| So the essential part of you're sitting to determine whether all the qualifications exist or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| If they exist, then you are obligated under the law to give a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| It sounds to me like what you're saying is I have a question about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| or not all the boxes are really properly checked or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| because I have a question about whether or not the zoning is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| And that would be a legitimate basis for a postponement that you argued against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| So we've got a motion to postpone until the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| It's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| So I want to ask for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| All those in favor of the postponement say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| So we'll see you back here in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| I had a calendar on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| I could tell you the exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| The 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| The 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| It will be the 23rd at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Did anyone from the Taj Indian Restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2857)|
| 0:47:47| So I'll make a motion that we postpone this permit, this application, until March 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| And then we have for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| Addenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Bringing to you for the first time tonight, first of all, hollow relax at 1208 North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| approved subject to final documentation in your November 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| And we're expecting Mr. Shue here to address what he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| Daniel Shue, 230 East Oklahoma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| We finished up construction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| We're just waiting on our inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| And we should be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| If we can get it in 30 days, we'll be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| Last, Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I'd like to move, and Mr. Schwantz can check my language, to extend the deadline on this for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2926)|
| 0:48:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Any discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| Second for your consideration, Spring Hill Market, 5016 Muttledge Pike, approved subject to final documentation in your November 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| We tried to contact the applicant by registered mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| The registered mail was returned, attempted but not known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| And we remailed notice to the store location and have heard nothing, either from the post office or the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| So I don't know whether you want to give them some more time or let it die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| What's the board's pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| I'm always inclined to extend these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| So I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| With regard to that, what is the advantage of extending as opposed to simply ending the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| and letting them start it again if they're not pursuing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| A fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| My feeling is there's some fees involved and the economy is not in good shape right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| And I can see somebody who has said, you know, I just don't have the money to finally finish this, and I would hate to punish them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| I think that this is, again, an administrative body in charging somebody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| $300, $400, $500 to fill out the paperwork again just seems we don't need to be petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| So that would be my inclination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| I just wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I think the only thing I have on that is 90 days seems like a long time for us to administer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| I mean, we have people come through this process and they go through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| and they go through with flying colors and they do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Not that these aren't doing the right thing, but it also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| puts an obligation on our people to continue to keep up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| And I think 90 days is just a long time, and it's already been since November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| So, you know, that's just my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| I think 90 days is a long time to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| I don't feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| I don't feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| 90 just came to me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Well, I mean, from, you know, from the middle of November until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| It's 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Yeah, I mean, it's already been 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I agree with Councilman Pavlis that 90 days is excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| 30 days might be more reasonable if there is a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| If the Board would feel better, I'll amend my motion to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| So all those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Is there further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| So that's all on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| And then we've got some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| The last three items you instructed us to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| and tell them that they could lose their mere permit if they did not respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| or take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| I understand that Latitude 35, the applicant is here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| Justin Nicholas, 18 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| I have taken a little bit longer to do the bill that we thought we were going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| We thought we were going to take a layer down, something else shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| So we ended up having to redo or rebuild completely in the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| So it's taken a little bit longer to get some of the final documentation that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| What would you anticipate your need would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| I would not say any more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| I would not want to see any more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Well, no, I mean, you know, don't take the prior action that you couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| I'm just saying, you know, you're in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| You're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I mean, to me it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| I can't speak for the Board, but to me it makes a big difference if you're having construction problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Just to be safe, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| 60 days would be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| I just want an extension to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| I'll move to extend 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Not all those in favor of extending for 60 more days, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Next, Smoke and Beer Outlet, 102 Sequoia Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| Signature card did come back to us the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| Received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| So, I don't know if the applicant is here for Smoke and Beer Outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| And the letter said be here or else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| So, if you take no action, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| Hearing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Hearing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| And lastly, Toolbox Bar and Grill, 7211 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| Exactly the same circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| We'll take a motion to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Hearing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| We'll die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| I believe that's all the business we have before the board tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| And I will entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100223?start=3273)|
