| 0:40:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Could we always, if we wanted to proceed with this less the R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| we could come back and amend it and put it back in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| if the sky wasn't falling and the demand...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| You could do nothing and wait until R1HK is in front of you and act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| I'm just saying it's just an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Could we also reduce the density from 12 to, say, 8 or 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| and have this be a reasonable type of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| Because it seems to be a concern to have such density on an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| so if we decrease the number of units from 12 to 8, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| then that would decrease the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| If density is a big issue to you, yes, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| Let's hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Councilman Sawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Back to that comment you just made about just put this on the side for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| and wait until the R1HK comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| because I was not aware that that was in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| If it is, that to me is a very interesting concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| and begins to, in my mind at least, better define at least where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| and especially in neighborhoods like you mentioned, Forth and Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| and perhaps parts of Old North, Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| they do have parts of it have pretty high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| As a matter of fact, there are some areas, interestingly, in Sequoia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| in Old Sequoia right in the middle down off Scenic Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| where there is a huge park and a bunch of very small houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| on very small lots all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Those were developed, I guess, post-Second World War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| I'm assuming that was the Deaver development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| You're very familiar with it, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| And there's another development kind of off Southgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| Yeah, beyond the library and around where there is a, it's not a courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| but it's a little cul-de-sac and about six homes around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| George, you might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Anyhow, the heart of Knoxville thing appeals to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| And I would like to know a whole lot more about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| than what the proposed definition is and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| And you've mentioned a lot of the neighborhoods that it might include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Okay, we will move to seeing no other lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| we will move to the public forum discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| And if you'll give your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you, members of Council, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| I seem to have been at this for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Let me make something very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Everybody knows you, but you still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Oh, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Let me make this very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| I think Knoxville should have every possible type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| I just don't agree with Mr. Donaldson that it should all be on the same block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| and that if it is all on the same block, that that's the strongest block in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| because that's not been my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| When you have a single-family detached home sitting next to a small apartment building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| sitting next to a single-family detached home on a larger lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| sitting next to a duplex, I will bet you those are the low-value streets in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| not the high ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Now, maybe in some other towns, and I've lived in some other places where that may be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| but that's not here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Let me also make some statements about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| The one-year plan is what controls density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Low-density residential, less than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Medium-density residential, I think it's up to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| Several of us in the community wondered when R1 and R1E were recommended for courtyard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| at 12 units per acre, how they were getting around the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| if they just overlooked it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| Let me talk about, and we're glad they were taken out by MPC, the R1 and R1E zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2659)|
| 0:44:29| because that made absolutely no sense, because R1, R1E are only in the low-density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| R1A is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| It's in the low-density, the medium-density, and another thing called traditional neighborhood, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2679)|
| 0:44:48| Regarding apartments in R1A and low-density, apartments, multifamily, in R1A is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2688)|
| 0:44:59| The first standard for use on review is that it shall follow the one-year plan, the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2699)|
| 0:45:07| So it's my position that if you're going to put an apartment building in a R1A, the density has got to be less than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2707)|
| 0:45:19| If you want to put in greater density, the use on review for the multifamily would mean that the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| would be amended to medium-density residential to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Let's also be very – there was a statement made at the MPC meeting in November that we needed R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| because it was a way to get the higher density without amending the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| I stood up and said I was absolutely opposed to that, and I remain absolutely opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I don't think that's what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| I think that's an end run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And now we understand, according to the one-year plan meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| that MPC is considering recommending getting rid of the one-year planning process, which will take a vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| Obviously, we're going to be down here opposed to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Density is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| It's not an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| It is what characterizes a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| It's wonderful to talk about infill and then talk about keep the mansion and build behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| I'm sure that's on more than an infill-sized lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| And I have to agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| This makes me very nervous when it comes to infill because what you're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| especially in the less expensive neighborhoods, which includes mine, where you still have some R1A zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2793)|
| 0:46:41| if someone can come in, take down one house or two houses, build 12 units per acre, rent them out, sell them, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2801)|
| 0:46:53| that bears no resemblance, is in no way in character with what else is on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| They may be small houses, but they're single-family detached on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| The other thing that, aside from the density issue that was raised by Courtyard Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| was the whole idea of how much protection is offered by use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| MPC would like to believe that with use-on-review, all your problems are solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| If you don't like it, it can be turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| That's not my understanding from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And, in fact, the zoning ordinance says that MPC shall give substantive factual statements as to the adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2846)|
| 0:47:36| in turning something down, and there's similar language for Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| So one can't just say, oh, it's use-on-review, so if the materials look too cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| you guys can turn it down because that doesn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Also statements that, oh, yeah, the façade has to match whatever's in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| but there are no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Now, I'm not an attorney, but I've been around this long enough to know that saying something has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| kind of, sort of similar and change this and change that with no clear standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| is an awful hard thing to uphold in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| That is why overlays have very clear standards, specify the roof pitch, specify the types of windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2891)|
| 0:48:21| It can't just be kind of sort in the eye of the beholder, kind of got to look like some kind of eclectic neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| with 14 different housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| So let's not kid ourselves as to what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Regarding the exact language, which I haven't dealt with, particularly regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| let me tell you, it's a pig in the poke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| Almost every...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| You're going to have to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Almost every single standard that's in here can be waived by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| I didn't have this list before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Joe Hulquist, 2240 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| I think a few of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| As someone who's been advocating for this, Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| the question about whether or not this should be strictly put under HK, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| a new zone that's not yet been created, I don't think it's an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| I think there's a clear justification for taking a close look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| and perhaps proceeding in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| There's a lot of rationale for going with the HK zone to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| and perhaps use for rezoning existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| that would fit better than the current zonings, especially R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| But that generally, I think, will take place in general rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| where you, MPC may initiate it or Council may initiate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| or Councilmember may initiate it like I know I did in the past in at least one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| But you're not talking about necessarily a small area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| but probably a pretty good area, perhaps a whole neighborhood at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Those are going to be very slow in coming and difficult at times, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| just like any general rezoning would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| So I think that that's something that has to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| And I know from looking at this and thinking about it a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| and thinking about parcels that I'm familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| especially in the district that I used to represent, which is mostly South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| there are some very unusual parcels sprinkled around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| and I know it's not true just of South Knoxville but the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| that don't really fit the communities around them real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| There's not, you know, the existing street grid, the street pattern, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| Sometimes those streets literally terminate at these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| And I can think of one that's very close to where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| not in Island Home, but very close in South Haven neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| that is about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| And the owners say that eventually they'll redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| They don't know what they're going to do with it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| But the older streets terminate to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| It doesn't really fit any kind of layout that exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| And you wouldn't see it from the other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| It's a unique example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| And I think that's why we need this to be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| this approach to the courtyard or pocket neighborhood development allowances to be codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| in the zoning ordinance so that we have the flexibility of allowing it where it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| And I think that there are unique examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Now, in terms of appropriate zones, you know, there are 1A arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| I hear what former council member Malone says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| And I think she makes a very strong argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Do I agree with her 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Well, maybe, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| We have yet to sit down and really argue this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| But I have tremendous respect for her and I know where she's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| I understand those concerns and her insights based on a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| So I would go with what some have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Councilman Wallace, Vice Mayor Pavlis, et cetera, has suggested that R1A be left out at least for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| And I think that would be my recommendation because I think that's sort of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| that seems to be the feel for what's coming here, a political reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| is that maybe council as a whole might not be comfortable taking that step because there really are some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| that are going to be there until there's a higher level of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| And I don't think that comfort level is there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| So I would suggest that council move on this, adopt it, with the exception of R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| And that can always be addressed and added in the future once we get some experience under our belts collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| and decide whether or not this is really a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| And if somebody wants to go that route, it's a little more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| But they can go through a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| And, again, that gives that extra level of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| And it definitely comes back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Parenthetically, I'll say that I understand former council member Malone's concerns about use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| And I think I said this to at least one or two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And I know Mr. Donaldson wouldn't be real happy with this without additional funding to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| But I'd like to see the consideration at least of a change where council, even an individual council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| or perhaps all of council or perhaps two or three members, however it could be structured best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| could essentially reach down and take something that has been approved under use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| and bring it to council for appeal without the citizens having to pay the fee and initiate the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| so the council itself could initiate the appeal process on use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| And Mr. Donaldson tells me he's not real happy with that thought because it's going to cost them more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| with an already strained budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And I think that's a very legitimate concern, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| At that, I will conclude my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| Martha Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3255)|
| 0:54:25| My name is Martha Olson at 2809 Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I think most of you know me as a community activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| But I'm also a landscape architect and I have gotten my contractor's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| and I'm hoping to start building small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| And there seems to be a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| And so this is why this particular issue is important to me because I've been following a lot of the e-mail groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3285)|
| 0:54:57| and discussion groups on small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| And there is a big demand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And one of the very common things you'll see is people wanting a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| And a lot of it, as you talk about, is the downsizing people, the downsizing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| the aging people wanting something less maintenance and wanting to have the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| So that's why I will urge you all to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| I think this is something that we're coming to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| It's not something we've done, you know, just because we haven't done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| But I think it's one of the trends that we're going to be seeing in housing over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| And if we can have it to where you can have the courtyard and actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| design it to promote community, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| I'll put in a plug for my profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| You could require a landscape architect to stamp it, and that might, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| give the wood maybe a little extra for the people just trying to slap something together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| as some are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| So I've been buying some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| One of them is in one of these overlay zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| It's off central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| I think I want to say traditional neighborhood or neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| It's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Anyway, they have a very well-defined, spelled out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3376)|
| 0:56:24| what they're looking for in the way of siding and roofs and all that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| And so I'm a little confused because I was under the impression that something like that would go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| with the courtyard zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I mean, it's not, you know, sort of a — it's pretty well specified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| and you have to put in an application, and you have to, you know, go before a board and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| So I think that, you know, I think I would imagine you would have something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3405)|
| 0:56:55| but admittedly that's not something I'm too familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| I think this is something that can be an asset to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| and there can be kind of odd lots, and it sort of depends on the neighborhood to neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| You know, you might have a neighborhood that's struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| that having an influx of new homeowners might really bring the neighborhood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| And so, you know, that's — I absolutely agree that it should be a use on — you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| there should be neighborhood input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| There should be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| And if this, you know, it needs to be compatible with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| and it needs to have the support of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| Personally, I would, you know, I absolutely agree that the R1, it doesn't belong in the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| It doesn't belong in the EN and all the estate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| It doesn't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| I differ in that I feel that it should be allowed in the R1A just because if someone has a piece of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3471)|
| 0:58:03| two lots or three lots, and they might be suitable for this kind of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| it would be a whole lot easier to say, I want to get it rezoned R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| than if they say, well, I'm going to get it rezoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Well, the neighborhood would be justifiably concerned that, hey, this is, you know —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| —that something could happen, and it would just be one of the standard apartment buildings like we see all over, you know, the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| So I'm also confused about the density, about the 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| I think that's a good density, but no more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| But, you know, if you have to rezone it to allow 24 units per acre in order to have that, that's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| because neighborhoods aren't going to want to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Even neighborhoods that are supportive of having this sort of thing, you know, the developer could, you know, it could change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3535)|
| 0:59:04| So I think that's something that needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| But I am very supportive, and I feel like just because it hasn't been a real big thing in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| I think it is going to be very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| And the things I'm reading on the Internet, on the, you know, blogs and things like that, is that there's going to be a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| And this is something that Knoxville could really stand out by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| and providing this kind of opportunity to seniors from around the country who are looking to relocate and want a nice climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3565)|
| 0:59:33| And they're going to want it to be close to stores and bus lines and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| So I think it really would be good to be able to make it comfortable so it's compatible with the infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| so infill and existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| And I think we just need to have good standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| I don't know whether Mr. Frost or Ralph or someone else can explain this, maybe Mark Donaldson, but what is the input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3597)|
| 1:00:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| What is the input that the neighborhood has outside of like a one-year plan or a sector plan when it's just purely a use on review activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3607)|
| 1:00:18| In other words, how does the neighborhood get involved in that process as opposed to deciding how the plan looks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3618)|
| 1:00:27| Is there a restriction in terms of the invitation for comments and hearings and all that type of stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| Well, generally speaking, your meetings for a one-year plan or, you know, plan updates, those address whole areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| They don't necessarily get down to the minutia of little properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| A one-year plan has lot by lot changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| But when you get to the use on review process, that's, you know, the rubbers meeting the road a little bit more right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| because you're talking about a specific proposal for a specific piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| And, you know, the folks who oppose or support the project, that's when they would, you know, could say their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| And depending on outcome, they could appeal to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| Mark, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| We provide public notice for uses permitted on review in the same manner that we do for individual lot plan amendments and changes to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3676)|
| 1:01:27| We publish in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| We publish on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| We mail notices to adjacent property owners within 200 feet of the edge of the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| That's one lot in each direction, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| One or two lots in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| And we post a sign on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| And do you allow time for comment on the specifics of the plan, including appearance of design and the details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| We hold a public hearing for every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| Let me recognize Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| During one of the public meetings concerning courtyard development, I asked a very naive question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| And the question started out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| we've got no problem with courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| If people want to have it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| It's another tool for builders, for developers, and nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| In talking about some of the problems, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| well, why don't we just create a courtyard development zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| And we can, if somebody wants courtyard development, you get it rezoned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| Everyone knows what's coming and that takes care of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| And staff corrected me and said, oh, no, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| That would be spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| Well, I think we're looking for a legal way to do a little spot zoning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| and just not call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| It's a wonderful tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Let's don't mess with the whole town starting this thing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Let's get rid of R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Councilman Wallace made some good points about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| If people with R1A need it, we can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| We can change the zoning ordinance again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| On the R1A business, to clarify, because it's very murky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| R1A can be in two different types of land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| It can be in low density, which would give you up to six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| no matter what you call the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| It can be in medium density, which will give you 12 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| if you have the acreage for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| That's the thing to remember about R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Just because you say it's now courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| does not automatically give you, as long as we have the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| which controls, read the MPC website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| read their handouts that they give out every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| one-year plan still controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| I would urge Council to go slowly on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| to either hook it to the new upcoming zone for the older city areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| And, Mr. Dela Lope, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| when did zoning change to parcels instead of just everything together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| It changed in 1938 when we got a regional planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| in this town for the first time, and we've had it ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Okay, there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| We'll see you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Yeah, Mark, why could we not have it as a separate zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| That's the same question I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| Well, if you created a zone where the use by right was courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| at up to 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| that takes away the discretion of the planning commission to control that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| and you would, in fact, have to go through a plan amendment of both the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| and the one-year plan to utilize a 12-unit-to-the-acre zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| in an area that's classified as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| If you found a parcel within an area that was zoned R1 or R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| and had low-density residential land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| and everybody agreed that that would be a good spot for a courtyard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| you would have to amend the sector plan, amend the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| and amend the zone district in order to allow that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| and it would be a spot within that general classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| But if I could just respond to the previous comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| the Metropolitan Planning Commission was created in 1956, not 1938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| The first city planning commission was back in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| Okay, we have one more question here, and we're just going to move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I'm just going to address it maybe to my colleagues, and that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| there's a lot of interesting aspects to this proposal that we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| but I don't see any harm in going in sort of light and then changing as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| I mean, if it turns out to be a really wonderful thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| then we can increase the number of zones you can do it in, we can raise the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| but why do we have to be all in at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| and maybe we could have it crafted so that the maximum density is 6, 8, 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| something like Councilwoman Palmer said, 8, unless they show, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| sufficient reason and evidence to MPC why the density should be increased in a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| But I would rather see us go in light, tread softly, see if it's working and desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| and then we can always come back and say, let's broaden it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| But once we throw open the door, we're going to have grandfathered parcels everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| that may or may not prove useful to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| So I'd like to see us just step in lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| If anyone's interested in changing the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| or eliminating a particular type of zone, at Tuesday's meeting, this is on Tuesday's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| I'd submit that they make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| If you're wanting to delete R1A, you just make a motion to amend it to delete its applicability to R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4071)|
| 1:08:00| That wouldn't mean it would have to go back to MPC or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| And for the density issue, if you wanted to make it less dense, you'd make a similar motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| but they probably ought to be two separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| With that, we'll move on to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Again, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I think it's very important that we pay attention to the one-year plan, to the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| to the low-density residential versus medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| I'm just going nuts at the idea that somehow, if we look at it sideways and squint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| we can get 12 units per acre or 8 units per acre in low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| because we call it SI versus MI, and that somehow that doesn't violate the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4126)|
| 1:08:55| I mean, the one-year plan, low-density residential, up to six, less than six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| Regarding R1A, if you want courtyard development at 12 units per acre in R1A, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| Just amend the one-year plan to show medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| I believe in truth in advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| If you're in for 12 units per acre, don't say it's low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| because you found some way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Say it's medium-density residential, amend the plan, have a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| let people decide whether or not they want to do it publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| without squinting and nodding and blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| That's my only position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Can I add one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| If we take R1A out, for example, we'll have R2 and other ones that allow medium-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| so we can solve that problem by not walking into it headlong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Because I was troubled by that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| You have communities that get together and look at the one-year plan with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| and the sector plan, and then that's laid out and it's sort of a zone of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| in terms of what's going to happen on individual parcels that come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| and then we'll have this conflict if we sort of violate that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| What she's saying is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Twelve units per acre is not low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| R2 is medium-density, and that's really what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| Just call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| It's R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| If we can eliminate R1A, then we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| And I think that's really my biggest stumble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Because that eliminates a lot of the infill opportunities that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| So now they have an R1 property, and they want to do courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and they're here for a rezoning to R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Then we can decide whether it's compatible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Tune in for more Tuesday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Sounds like it's going to be a doozy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| We'll go to number five on the agenda, which is, again, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Cemetery rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4262)|
| 1:11:12| They have led a little more tortured path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4272)|
| 1:11:23| I see a November 2011 date suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| There have been amongst a whole number of considerations of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| But the last recommendation that we made was after a city council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| and after amending staff's recommendations at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| to reflect comments made at the meeting by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| And, frankly, it's been so long, I can't even remember them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| to summarize them very succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| But the gist was that rather than managing crematories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| we were going to manage funeral establishments as a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| and we were going to reduce the number of zone districts that funeral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| establishments were permitted in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| acknowledging that facilities for cremation were considered a part of a funeral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| establishment by state law that has been supported by a fairly recent court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4356)|
| 1:12:45| and one really old court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| And then in doing so, we created definitions for a variety of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| that we needed along the way, cemeteries, columbariums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| and provided for memorial gardens, columbariums within cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4383)|
| 1:13:16| We also made a provision to consider crematories and animal crematories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| as uses permitted on review in the industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4404)|
| 1:13:38| What else do you want to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4418)|
| 1:13:46| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| I understand that some of the language has been adjusted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| and this is directed to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Is this a good time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Angela Halver and I have spent some time talking about these different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| and I definitely want to say we think MPC has done a yeoman's task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| in working to grasp a very difficult topic matter that sometimes can seem like jello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4454)|
| 1:14:24| because it's morphed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| And a lot of time has passed since this originally came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| and we had a workshop that was snowed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| I thought we were going to have that again this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| But there are some things that, when Angela and I have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| we'd like to politely suggest some further tweaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| some things that, you know, at the very first workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| a large amount of time was spent covering a large amount of material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| and some things might have been lost in translation or just simply misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| and we'd want to, you know, take an opportunity to talk about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| and also take into account, you know, some of the suggestions of different community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4509)|
| 1:15:17| some of which, you know, they heard what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| and Angela think council's intentions were, but it didn't necessarily match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4521)|
| 1:15:30| So one thing that we need to remember is that these structures are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4530)|
| 1:15:38| by Tennessee State Court of Appeals law, crematoriums are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4538)|
| 1:15:47| They're part of the funeral business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| We're not able to regulate them as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| They're going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| So suggestions that we call them an accessory use are really going to be ineffective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| for trying to appropriately site these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4565)|
| 1:16:14| You know, we looked over what NPC came back with at their most recent meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| which it was in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| It's been going along for that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| And looking at town hall's suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| they were wanting to talk about the crematoriums need to be certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| and that language was missing from what NPC said or suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| Crematoriums have to be certified by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| No matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| It's not necessary that that language be in the city ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| because they have to be licensed by the state of Tennessee, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| in order to be in business at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| They also talked about the definition of a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| And, you know, I'll definitely get together with Mr. Donaldson at a near date in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| and, of course, Mrs. Halber can come along too for her input as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4648)|
| 1:17:36| But, you know, we've got some permissive language in some of the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| When we respectfully submit, we need some mandatory language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| changing some mays to some shalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| It provides better clarity for people who would perhaps like to make a crematorium in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| and also provide a little clarity for those in whose vicinities these might want to be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4677)|
| 1:18:12| Further going on, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| There's a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Town Hall brings to our attention the definition of a funeral establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| and specifically Part E facilities for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| Mrs. Halber and I would submit that that probably can be eliminated because it's not well defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4711)|
| 1:18:40| A very general tenet of law is you can't regulate what you don't define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| So, as she'll talk about here in a little bit, a new topic has come up, which we think, well, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4727)|
| 1:19:00| I've worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| Like I mentioned earlier, Town Hall is suggesting crematory be an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| The Court of Appeals decision, we wouldn't be able to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| One thing that we think was lost in translation was the distance requirement, the 500-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| Originally, it was suggested over 2,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| We didn't think that that was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| There was talk about 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Maybe it was Councilman Della Voppe who talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| if scientific standards could prove that you could cite it closer, that would devolve into a battle of the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4780)|
| 1:19:52| And, you know, you could have a situation where someone, a proponent of these, could find an expert that would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4792)|
| 1:20:02| well, this technology is so clean, you could live 10 feet from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| I don't want it any closer, so it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| But you have a situation where you could have a community business or group that can't afford to go out and hire an expert to look at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4814)|
| 1:20:27| So I think the idea, what we talked about, that maybe got lost in translation was that it was going to be a 500-foot standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| and that hard number you would do away with any experts that might have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4835)|
| 1:20:45| And if you just put it at 500 feet, you made a clear standard that the person wanting the crematorium could understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4845)|
| 1:20:54| and the people in the vicinity could easily understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| The variance process is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| For some reason, you can prove, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| I don't understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| I mean, are you proposing that we're going to postpone this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Are you going to rewrite it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| No, there's some suggestions that we're going to make, and Angela and I think, yeah, we're going over it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| and that it's ultimately, because of these changes, we'll, unfortunately, have to go back to MPC one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| So eventually, this will get done, hopefully, sooner versus later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4884)|
| 1:21:33| Other language that we think needs to be changed regards, you know, the funeral establishment to better define what one unit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4893)|
| 1:21:44| We also need to improve the definitions concerning what things are primarily related to cremations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4904)|
| 1:21:53| versus primarily related to the funeral business, because we've talked about one-third of the total floor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| There's a little ambiguity in there that needs some further refinement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| to what I think was the intention of counsel at our previous workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| So the document in front of us is not what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| Well, I mean, the document in front is what everything's going to be based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| I mean, we're needing to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| You're tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| You're not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| We're tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| We're improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| We're not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| So then we should just get a public comment and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| I'd like to discuss one aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| In just looking at this quickly, without regard to the details that they're going to get into in fine-tuning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| it strikes me that when you look at, what is it, Article 5, Section 3, under funeral establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| I think we need to have more clarity in the floor space sort of designated for the cremation aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4984)|
| 1:23:16| It seems to me that that's really loosey-goosey in terms of what we're trying to restrict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| but I think that it should say that if we're going to use the 33 percent floor area of a funeral establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| we should say that it's – add to the devoted to that it's the entire process of cremation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| whether it's the facility unit itself, whether it's the bone-grinding feature, whether it's the floor display area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| But, in other words, the idea of cremation could take up a third of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| but the unit itself is – I've seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| They're probably three feet wide and 20 feet long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| and you're never going to be more than 33 percent of the building if we focus on the little burner thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| I think we have to take the floor space dedicated to cremation as the cut point between something that's part of a funeral establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5040)|
| 1:24:09| incidentally, and something that's primarily a crematory that goes to the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| And that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| We ought to look at that aspect of that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Right, and that's the very last page of our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Because there are some uses in a funeral facility that will be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| whether it's for the public service or traditional burial or cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| All those chapels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| That's why we came up with a proposed language to further hone that down, where it better defines what things look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5081)|
| 1:24:50| You know, council was wanting to address one-third of the floor space for things primarily associated with the services dealing with cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5090)|
| 1:25:00| Right, but I'm just suggesting, as you look at the wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| that you not focus simply on the device itself because there are other adjunct activities and floor space used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| And if you don't take that into account, anybody can say it's less than a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| I mean, I think you just throw the doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| We'll go to the public forum section then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| I think we've obviously still got some work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| And I feel like we're aging in place as we continue this with crematorium maybe dying in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5136)|
| 1:25:45| But I appreciate the work that's been done by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| I think this has come a tremendous distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And also the work that's being done by your trusted legal counsel in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| Our main concerns at Fountain City Town Hall is to make sure from a legal standpoint that something that is a principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5160)|
| 1:26:14| and we're talking crematory as part of a funeral home, not freestanding industrial, but as part of a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| We want to make sure that as a principal use that crematories in a funeral home can be limited in space relative to the other services offered at the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5181)|
| 1:26:36| In other words, that you can enforce legally the 33% or whatever percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| And we assume that areas devoted strictly to the cremation process as well as viewing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| and any other maintenance areas specific to cremation will be part of that 33%, not just the crematory box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5211)|
| 1:26:59| But I've tried to think of other areas where we've said the principal use can be limited relative to the other principal uses on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5219)|
| 1:27:14| Like we don't tell Walgreens that their pharmaceutical area has to be no more than 33% or no less than 50% compared to their skin care and hair care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5234)|
| 1:27:32| Or with Kroger, you don't say your vegetables have to be a certain percentage compared to meat or that you even have to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5252)|
| 1:27:41| And that's why the accessory use thing was so appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| And I understand it from a legal standpoint based on lawsuits, we're not able to use it as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| An accessory use by definition is subordinate in size and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5269)|
| 1:27:57| So one of our concerns, because we don't like surprises, is just we want to make sure that from a legal standpoint everything is buttoned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5277)|
| 1:28:07| and that we can limit, because you'll also notice in the definition of funeral establishment, it says you can have all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5287)|
| 1:28:15| chapels and areas to view the deceased and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| It doesn't say you have to have any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| And what I know you don't want and what I know our neighborhoods certainly don't want is to suddenly wake up one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| and there's the crematory on the hill saying funeral home and it meets all the standards and we can't do anything more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5307)|
| 1:28:35| We just want to make sure that, you know, our expectations and your expectations are legally grounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| And, again, I appreciate all the work that MPC, the law department and city council has done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5322)|
| 1:28:51| We feel it's also very important we agree with Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| The 500-foot thing from a daycare center or existing home or whatever should be an absolute that can get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| but not be arguable bringing in the need to hire experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| What I was going to say, I was going to offer, when Mrs. Halberd and I talked, I made notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| And as I did last time, if people, if you all would like to try to decipher my notes, I'm happy to provide them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5362)|
| 1:29:31| I mean, it's some, we had some legal conversations about going on how to, you know, give certainty to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5371)|
| 1:29:40| if they want to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| So there's some, you know, some minutiae and some things that need to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| Charlotte Davis, 104 Crawford Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| I just want to make a very brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I would ask that before a crematorium becomes a part of any community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| that the residents of that community be involved in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| This is a courtesy that was not extended to the residents of Fountain City when the crematorium was added to Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5407)|
| 1:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Let me just say, I know that there have been some questions about the 33%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| And the reason that the city and Rob, we believe that that's enforceable because we have used it as a standard for other zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5431)|
| 1:30:42| And one example is with sexually oriented businesses, in order to be defined as a sexually oriented business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5442)|
| 1:30:53| a business has to have a certain amount of its business devoted to sexually oriented materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5453)|
| 1:31:05| And that number that we use to trigger that is 33%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| Okay, can I just ask, is that part of the zoning ordinance or part of some other regulation set of laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| It is a police powers ordinance, but it is also considered to be a land use regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| We have two different ordinances that regulate sexually oriented businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| And in most jurisdictions, the sexually oriented business regulation is part of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| In ours, we did not do it that way, but we did send it through MPC for consideration because it was considered land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| But it has elements of police power ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| So it's a unique feature in Knoxville's ordinance, but typically it is a zoning ordinance in other jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5506)|
| 1:31:55| and it's been upheld throughout the country as a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| I was wondering two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| One, it looks like we have put, even in funeral establishments, this as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and so my original question earlier in the courtyard is there will still be some notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| and opportunity to participate to answer Ms. Davis' question vis-à-vis that use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| Or Mr. Donaldson, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| For any new funeral establishment, that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| Not the existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| No, the existing funeral establishments would be not subject to the use permitted on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5556)|
| 1:32:45| for any expansions or interior modifications or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| And this goes back to that general state law that the billboard people put in place that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| once I got it, I can fix it, change it, grow it, and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| It's grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Pretty much, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Under the general heading of grandfathering, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| you're subject to those regulations that were in place when you were established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| We've got to get a good lobbyist in Nashville to exclude this, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| We're going to have, what, a deferral if five council members agree at the council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| so that the additional language will come before us, or will we have it by Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| I mean, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| You have to actually publicize the new language, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| No, I mean, we'll have to get with Mr. Donaldson, and they'll have to have it at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| Well, council connects first and then send it back to MPC as a finished product, can't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| I mean, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| You can pass it as your ordinance and then ask them to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| It's either or, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| You certainly could draft it, but you cannot act on it until there's a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and that may be the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Is there any other business to come before us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130228?start=5648)|
