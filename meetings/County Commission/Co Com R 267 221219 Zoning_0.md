| 0:09:07| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I will now look to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Mr. Braden, since you're unfamiliar with how processes work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| That was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| I was smiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Anyways, so Mr. Turner has 16.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| He's carving out one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| He's submitted in his plan a survey for a one acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| Is he planning on subdividing that one acre lot for two homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| No, he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| And the one acre is there, but it could not be continued as ag zone because the access easement can't be calculated in the one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=588)|
| 0:10:01| So there's only like seven-tenths of an acre, so therefore it would meet the RA restrictions in the zoning ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| So basically the structure is going to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| It's just a cleanup of a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Well, he's dividing it off, but he can't reduce his 16-acre lot anymore because he will violate the green belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=616)|
| 0:10:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| That's what I wanted to clarify then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=630)|

| 0:11:31| Property located at 3029 Leg Lane, parcel ID 041-174 in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Sir, please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=704)|

| 0:12:03| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| Okay, Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| Mr. Hutchins, you'll have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| And then Mr. Murphy will have time to speak to his opposition, and then you can speak to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| Do I have the option of going after the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| No, you can speak now, and then Mr. Murphy can speak, and then you can have a minute or two to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| For our rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Can we hear the planning recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| Well, the item that's up right now is for, it's not the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=772)|
| 0:13:02| It's the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| It's the sector plan, changing that, which will allow us to, we have to do that in order to get to the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=783)|
| 0:13:12| which is a rezoning on the property, and we are trying to get a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| It's 3.06 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Some of it is under hillside protection, so there's a steep area that's less desirable as far as building goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:39| but under the current plan, it would be one unit per acre, and as you'll see in the next part, the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| what we're seeking is two dwelling units per acre, and under a PR zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| and I can't talk about what I'm doing here without talking about the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| because that's what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Under that, that allows us a number of different configurations that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| either single family houses, houses that have garage apartment additions, or duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| but the net of that is whatever configuration that takes, and that, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| goes to MPC for additional review and approval, and it will be scrutinized also by county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:41| There's another, you know, this is just the first part of the process to get the density to where we can do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| The idea, the concept is to cluster the residential portion and then maintain the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=889)|
| 0:15:01| and less desirable construction areas that can be common area for all the residential units that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=901)|
| 0:15:13| There is one existing single family residential house on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| so what we would be adding would be a total of five units in some configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| We've already done an application to KUB for sanitary, which impacts the lot size and the configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=926)|
| 0:15:37| They gave us an approval on capacity to be able to do a total of six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| We would have to extend from Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| There's a development, Ely Development, that's across the street from where the intersection is for Leg Lane in Millertown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=947)|
| 0:15:58| that has the sanitary at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Our extension of that has to be approximately 900 feet to get it to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| What that does is it provides contiguous properties with sanitary access also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=970)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Ms. Poitier, will you read us the Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| I move the sector plan amendment to RR, rural residential, and HP, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| because the property meets the location criteria for RR and is consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Now, Mr. Murphy, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I'm here speaking on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance and also the RIDA Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| We're here asking for you to support the applicant requested two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| The staff recommended one unit per acre, and the Planning Commission then approved two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| We're here asking you to consider and approve one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Why are we asking that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| The rezoning report includes a statement on page three that PR at one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| is consistent with the proposed land use designation of rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| and the rural residential does not recommend PR zoning in excess of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| Now, this gets back to the sector plan, and in particular, there's a land use classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| which is Appendix B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| That's on the second page of the handout that I gave to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| And that land use classification table, that's specific to each of our sector plans has a specific one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| This one is specific to the northeast county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| And I was at six of the eight public meetings that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Maybe it was four of the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Four of the six public meetings that happened during the 2015 update cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| And there was a lot of intentional conversation and looking at how we want our rural area to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| in the northeast county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| And the recommendations and the zonings to consider came out of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| So there was a lot of public input that went into this, a lot of input by planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| planning commission, and then finally adoption by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| In the rural area, there's two kind of residential land use classifications that are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| One could be agricultural, and the other is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| I pointed out in the handout, in the agricultural land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| which is what this property currently is, it recommends, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| that it be ag or an agricultural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| But it also says other zoning to consider is planned residential at densities of one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| where the dwellings are clustered in one portion of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| That's exactly what we want to do is we want to cluster those dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| and then conserve it in the other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Rural residential is the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| And rural residential here is a little different than some of the other sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Rural residential, if you look below that, also has in the recommend zoning, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| in the county rural area, planned residential at densities of one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| where the dwellings are clustered in one portion of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| So those are the two that are allowed by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| The request and what Planning Commission recommended at two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| is not in the land use classification table, and it is outside of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| And that, if you were to take a vote that way, that would be in conflict of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| which I'm going to bring you back to page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Section 6.30 of our zoning ordinance has standards for amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| which includes MAP amendments like what's being requested here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And D there says a proposed amendment shall be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| and not in conflict with the general plan of Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| including any of its elements, which is our sector plans, as well as our land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| So there's a zoning ordinance that says if you rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| it's supposed to be in harmony with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| So that, hence, is our reason for asking you to support one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| That's what the sector plan says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| You have a choice on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| You could do rural residential or agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Here, the rural residential is, you know, there's no rural residential around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| There is, it should be pointed out, the Millertown Pike this is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| is the borderline between planned growth area and rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| So there is a subdivision at four units an acre on the south side in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| but you're in the rural area, and all that is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| And there is an intentionality, again, around that when the sector plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| which was a broad agricultural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| You could consider rural residential, but in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| you can also just leave it ag if you want to do one unit per acre clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| So you don't necessarily have to adopt a sector plan amendment to do PR at one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Mr. Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| In 2015, we weren't considering housing to necessarily be a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1281)|
| 0:21:32| And there's a lot that's going on, and there's a lot that needs to be done to our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| The city overhauled the zoning two years ago, and there's a lot of positives in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| And there's an appropriateness to density in zoning that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| And there's many things in the county that could be cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| You can't do anything, but you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| There's nothing that addresses an ADU, an accessory dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| which is a major premise of the zoning in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| And the zoning in the county is extremely antiquated and needs to be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| particularly in terms of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| I'm an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| I've been in practice for 35 years with my own business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| and I've been practicing architecture for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| And I do a lot of residential work, and there's a way to do it that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| And the clustering of it and the protection of the hillside to do that is the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:52| And we need more housing, and Knox County needs more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| And I understand the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Jeff Welch, the head of MPC, presided at the meeting where we got the zoning approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1384)|
| 0:23:13| or where we got the sector plan amendment approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| And Jeff pointed out that the staff was bound to the one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| and the planning commission had the authority to go up to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1405)|
| 0:23:36| And they were on board with that, and you'll see what the vote is when we get to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| But part of what changing the county sector plan amendment does is it allows you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| if you go to PR, you can cluster the units and you can put them in a different configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| If you don't have that, it's one unit per acre, and you've got to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and you've got to put a unit on an acre of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| And the top part of this is extremely steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| It's not going to be agriculture for any use that I know of in the slope that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| And the way to do it is to do it per a planned residential that allows you to be able to cluster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| that development and have the balance of the land to be usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| So really the issue here is are you going to allow a density that can be achieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1468)|
| 0:24:42| and can be achieved in a very desirable fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| or are you going to look at this just like legislation and read black and white descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1489)|
| 0:24:59| that don't necessarily take into account what can be achieved with land where you can preserve slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| and you can have a more reasonable density and you're not stringing it out across the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| and putting residential on what would be a challenging slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| that would be perhaps considered less desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| So there's a way to do it, and there's a way to do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| And the density of two per acre across the street on Millertown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| that density is less than four per acre in the Ely development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| And that's all you have to consider the slopes that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| That's a relatively moderate slope development over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| And the thing that allows that, which is the same thing that allows it everywhere in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| is when you have access to sewer, then you can do your density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| and you don't have the restrictions of lot size and having to do a drain fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| So we're comfortable that this is an acceptable density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| and the planning commission was comfortable with that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| and in fact, as you'll see on the next request, was comfortable with the density of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| So this sector plan amendment is the step before to get us to the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| that allows us flexibility in the placement of our residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| I will look to my fellow commissioners for any discussion regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Michelle, I didn't look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| On an ag land, if there's sewer available, you can put more than one unit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| like 25,000, 20,000 square feet or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| It's one acre dwelling unit is the density in the ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| regardless of whether you have sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| That's the minimum lot size in that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| So you would have to go to PR or something or other to get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| To cluster it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| To cluster it into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| Kind of torn here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| I'm going to lean on my fellow commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| For three houses, six houses, I've checked into sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| 900 feet of sewer is $200,000-plus right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| That's a huge investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| That's your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| That's not our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Just wanted to clarify that he would still have to go to some type of PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| or whatever to get that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| That's not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Commissioner Daley, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| That's not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| I'm just saying that's a good point that you made in that when you extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| the sewer, there's a development criteria that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| in order to make the economics of it viable, that six is about the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| If you go below that, then extending the sewer doesn't make a lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| especially for three houses if one of them is already there and on septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1721)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1731)|

| 0:28:55| Looking at this piece of property, Mr. Hutchins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I hear you when you say that we need higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| However, I don't feel that it's appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I tend to go back to our staff recommendations that one per acre would align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| with existing development simply because when you read through this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| you will notice that this request of two per acre could actually result in six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| units per acre on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| And that's not in character with existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| So I'm going to have to lean back on our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| I think they got it right here that one per acre is appropriate in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Keep in mind this is a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| And the density discussion is really on the next part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| And what this allows to happen is to be able to cluster it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| whether it's three or whatever the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| And if this is not approved, then it's going to be one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| You're going to have to have an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| and that's going to put you on a 40% slope at the very top to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| So this affects the configuration of the power, whatever the density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| That's what this affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I'd like to ask Mr. Murphy a question, if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Mr. Hutchins wouldn't mind to yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I see you shaking your head, Kevin, because where I'm struggling with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| I'm struggling with the sector plan amendment just because of what sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| plan amendments can be a precedent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| But I'm kind of torn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Like Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I understand the clustering is important on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| So, Kevin, were you saying that there is a way to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| Certainly, and I'd encourage you to ask a very experienced staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| If you do nothing or do something on the sector plan either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| you can always rezone at the next step to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| which then gives you the ability to have different lot sizes that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| planned residential zoning ordinance allows and to do clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| So you can actually, you know, and when they come up with a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| they can have smaller lots clustered on the flat portion towards the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| of the property, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| But I'd encourage you to ask staff that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Ms. Portier, can I ask this couple of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| Is what Mr. Murphy just said correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| This could still be rezoned to PR, even if the sector plan remains as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| The agricultural land use in this particular sector does allow for the PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| zone at a density of one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| Another question would be, do you know what the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| what their reasoning was for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| I'm assuming the staff did recommend against the sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| No, we supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| It's not necessary that you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| If you wanted to have the density of one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| you could have the sector plan remain as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| We recommended, we supported the request because it specifically states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| within the rule residential talks about conservation and clustering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| so we felt like it was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| We didn't deny it, but you could leave it agricultural if you wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| and have it at one dwelling unit per acre, depending on how you're leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| But it was the density that the staff recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| We recommended a density of one dwelling unit for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| We just put it in PR instead of ag so that they could cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Yeah, I'm familiar with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| Obviously, I lived there all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Because when I look at Leg Lane, I'm not really looking at Ely Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| I'm looking at the other side of the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| which is the one dwelling unit per acre PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Because that Leg Lane is a lot more comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| to what's on the other side of the ridge than it is to Ely Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| what's on the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| So I would support the zoning change to PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| but I have a tough time with the sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| for this small piece of property that's essentially on a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| So I'll yield if anyone else has any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| To echo what Commissioner Beeler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| if we can accomplish the same outcome without amending a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| that's definitely the way to go, especially if this is a smaller parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| So I would support that, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Well, on this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| my motion is that we deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| and the property would remain in the sector plan agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Motion is to deny the sector plan amendment by Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2076)|

| 0:34:43| It's a request of David Hutchins for rezoning from A agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2083)|

| 0:35:18| Approve the PR planned residential zone up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2118)|

| 0:35:30| No, you guys are in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2134)|

| 0:35:43| Well, seeing there's nothing else really to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| I move that we approve rezoning of this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| to planned residential at a density of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2155)|

| 0:36:18| Just a clarification, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| We can do this without changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| or did we have to change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| No, I think Ms. Portier from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| was clear that you could amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| you could make this change without amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yes, I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| For clarification, your motion was one per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Planning Commission, though, is recommending two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Staff recommended one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Planning Commission approved two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Motion on the floor is to approve planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| If I may, the discussion that I had with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| on the preliminary basis on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| was that we needed to have the sector plan amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| and that's why we took this course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| There's documentation in that that shows the hillside overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| and I believe it indicates that there are what would be permissible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| would be something like four units for the total site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| as opposed to the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| So I don't know what precipitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| I would like to know why our recommendation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| that we change the sector plan if we could have gone straight for a PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| I guess that wasn't going to be allowed with a higher density, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| No, I wasn't part of that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| so I'm not really sure what all was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Maybe there was some sort of miscommunication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| but according to the Northeast Sector Plan, the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| it says within the ag land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| it specifically says PR densities of one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| where dwellings are clustered in one part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| So maybe it was because you were requesting two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| that they were saying that you needed to get the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Rural residential in this particular sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| does cap it at one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| but this is the last sector plan in which that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| So there was a recognition that the rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and agricultural both had the same density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| which didn't really make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| So after this particular sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| subsequent sector plans started to have the rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| at two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| so that's probably where that came in if I had to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| And, sir, to respect everyone's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| since we have voted on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| can you have this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Anytime you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Item number 51, 11-C-22-SP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| is a request of Knox County Planning for a text amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| and a map amendment to the South County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| from O Office to MU-SD-SEO-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Mixed Use Special District Alcoa Highway Small Area Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| for properties as listed on Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| pursuant to the adoption of the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| by the Knox County Commission on July 25, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| This is in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| Seeing as how the request is from Knoxville-Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Ms. Poitier, do you have anything to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| No, but I am happy to answer any questions anyone might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Commissioners, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Michelle, they've heard from me quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| You've been part of this small area plan for the past five years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Can you give us, give the commissioners an update from your view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| They know that we're trying to increase businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| get business to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| but I would like for you to give the planning's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| As to the benefits of the plan, do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| So because of the construction along Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| the already stressed commercial corridors there started to suffer further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| and there is an increase in vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| And we started looking into this corridor in an attempt to sort of mitigate some of those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| So we wanted to look at specifically how we could maybe remove some of the barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| that people were encountering when trying to redevelop some of these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| and we wanted to involve the community in how they wanted to see this area change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| The surrounding residents and homeowners associations were very heavily involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| as were the business owners along the corridor itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| There were very many, there were a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| There was a charrette that was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| So we really did get a lot of community input and tried to be inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| and very transparent throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| The feedback that we've gotten has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| We've passed some amendments in the city that go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| This is the county side that you all are seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| So really what we're proposing tonight is to extend the MUSD, that land use classification, further south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| And what that does is just adds flexibility to those commercial properties directly along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| So right now there's some that have commercial zoning, some that have office zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| and I think maybe one or two that might have some, I guess, medium density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| But those are specific so that you can only have commercial or you can only have office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| or you can only have residential, whereas the mixed use special district has all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| So with that, their zoning would still be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| It's just that if someone else were to buy the property, it would give them some flexibility with what they could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| The other thing that's before you tonight is a text amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| So how the sector plan is written now, any sort of commercial zone would be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| whereas not all of the commercial zones within the county zoning ordinance are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| with what we see as the vision for this part of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| So we're wanting to be a little bit more deliberate, a little bit more specific with the zones that we've added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| so that what we do get in the corridor is more in line with the vision that we have for the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| and not just our vision but the community's vision, the input that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| So that's the core of what's before you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| I'd like to thank Planning because I've been to several of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| They did a great job working with the community, and the community showed up for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| They really did. So I'm going to make a motion to approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Motion is to approve Planning Commission action by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:45| Any discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| Any opposed? That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2632)|

| 0:45:13| I want to make a motion to approve so we can get a discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2713)|

| 0:45:19| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daly, with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| This is the first reading, so we'll have another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Did we set a public date yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| We did, and it is, let me double-check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| it is the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| It's before our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Rules Committee is at 3, so we'll have it at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Mr. Snowden, can you explain to me what is non-permanent habitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| Yeah, in our opinion, we've kind of, that language, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| was codified in the ordinance we kind of modeled this after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| In our opinion, non-permanent habitation is anything that isn't a recreational vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| or camper or doesn't meet the intent of the International Residential Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| So that's just kind of a catch-all of any other, you know, habitable or non-habitable uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| If somebody has a tiny home on wheels, would that classify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| If someone had a park model mobile home, would that classify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| What, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| A park model, which is normally designated as 38 to 40 feet in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| Yeah, we check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| That is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| That's not regulated by the state like a traditional mobile home, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Okay, and then there's nothing in this Exhibit A, particularly on Section 6-12-05 standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2815)|
| 0:47:05| that we're talking about anything other than a residential lot that somebody wants to build a home on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2825)|
| 0:47:13| and have alternative housing on that lot while they're under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| That is correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Mr. Snowden, we all know the intent of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| In your opinion, does this get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| Does this get what our intention is, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| to allow somebody to live there while they're building a house kind of scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| We believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| I mean, this is a way for folks that, you know, want to have that temporary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| and there are what we feel to be robust enough regulations for us to permit that use from continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| beyond its necessary means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So we're comfortable with the wording of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| as it related to Commissioner Bussler's original request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Mr. Snowden, in discussions with Knox Planning and back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| was there any conversation that the parcel size should be more than one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| like set it beginning at two acres, since this was supposed to be done in the rural environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| We talked about that, but we kind of felt like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| based on looking at some of the other similar ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| that one acre in size was appropriate in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Mr. Snowden, will there be a permitting process for this temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| and will there be a building permit for the new home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Are we looking at a temporary permit that's good for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| so we know that we can get them out in six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| In addition to the building permit, they'll also be required to apply for a temporary use permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| and that will be tied to inspections and the building permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| So should somebody not comply with the terms of their building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| we can enforce that to make sure of the removal of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Mr. Snowden, how would this conform with the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| which are both also in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| You know, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| I personally didn't look at either of their zoning ordinances for this specific issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Do you think this would supersede their overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| I mean, would this take precedence over a local township or a city entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| or in the sort of layer of jurisdiction would theirs come first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| No, I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| I believe that their particular zoning ordinance would control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| and ours would just include the outside of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| So this would just be purely county only without any jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| I will look to my commissioners for a motion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Motion is to approve by Commissioner Daley, with a second by Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-zoning?start=3044)|
