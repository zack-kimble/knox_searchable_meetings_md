| 0:00:36| I'd like to welcome all that are here this evening and those that are watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| And we will begin by having the invocation by Councilman Campin and the Pledge of Allegiance by Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=40)|
| 0:00:51| We gather this evening thankful for another day, another opportunity to serve our city and its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| Let us listen thoughtfully and respect each other's positions on the matters before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| Please protect our police, our firemen and women, and all those that serve others in our community. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=61)|
| 0:01:08| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=68)|
| 0:01:16| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=76)|
| 0:01:26| Mr. Johnson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Councilman Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Councilman Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Councilman De La Volpe. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Vice Mayor Grieve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Councilwoman Palmer. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=93)|

| 0:01:38| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Before we get started, I have a few comments that I would like to make to the audience and to our council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=103)|
| 0:01:51| First of all, all of us understand this evening the seriousness of what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| I want you to know that not only in the last week have we had reviewed past council meetings in terms of when they've elected council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=116)|
| 0:02:07| but we've also had conversations with both our legal counsel, Rob Frost, and also with the city law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| in terms of proper procedures and what should transpire for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| We've also discussed the situation with Cliff Rogers, the Knox County Administrator of Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| He's also checked with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| So we're going to hear shortly from both Mr. Rogers and also Mr. Frost in terms of the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| and what needs to transpire this evening in terms of what we're here to do in terms of the order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| As an aside, I just want to say that it's obvious that all of us have been preaching how important it is to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| and I think that tonight it really shows that each vote really counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| It's very seldom in the history of Knoxville that there's been a tie vote such as we have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| And so I would like to encourage all of the people, not only you folks that are here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| but also the folks listening or watching on TV, how important it is that for the general election that's coming up that we do get out and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| and let's see if we can't double or even triple the number of votes that will be cast in this upcoming election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| It's so important. Each vote is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| What we're here tonight to do is we're going to follow on two particular items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| The first item of business will be the decision on procedures for conducting a vote pursuant to the Tennessee Code Annotated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| and in terms of how we're going to deal with what occurred during the primary election of August 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| The second then will be the selection of the second place candidate in the fourth district that we'll be looking at on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| But first, what I'd like to do is I'd like to have Cliff Rogers, again the Knox County Administrator of Elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| to come up and explain to council and to the public where we are, how we got to where we are, and what options that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| After Mr. Rogers speaks, we're then going to have our special counsel and advisor to city council, Rob Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| explain to us also what alternatives we have and where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| So Cliff, if you will come up first, we would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=264)|
| 0:04:35| Mr. Vice Mayor and city council members, thank you for the opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| and in particular to lay to rest once and for all the understandable but misguided notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| that a runoff election as contemplated by TCA 2-8-111, the statute which speaks to tie votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| could somehow be conducted in complete accordance with Tennessee state law between the time of the primary election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=297)|
| 0:05:06| held last Tuesday and the date of the regular election which must be held on Tuesday, November the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| To conduct such a runoff election is not virtually impossible as I was correctly quoted in the Knoxville News Sentinel today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| It is simply impossible. The word virtual is unnecessary as I will outline shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| But before I do so, let me make a couple of observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| I may very well be the least surprised person in this city that we had a tie vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| I had a premonition, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| Of course, I am surprised that it occurred in the 4th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| I thought it would probably occur in the 6th district where we had 13 candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| But we all knew or suspected that we would have way too few voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| While we did in fact set a record for turnout in a city primary without a mayor's race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| it is still, by any objective measure, a poor turnout when less than 10% of the registered voters actually vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| In my view, we are all here tonight because over 90% of the registered city voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| while they might care about the city, well, they do not care enough to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| And they, the overwhelming majority of folks out there, cannot be heard to complain about whatever you do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=384)|
| 0:06:33| At any rate, I have been talking to my election officials and staff for the last two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| about the very real possibility of a one or two vote election or even a tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| especially as it related to the second place finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| The message to our workers during our training classes, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| was to treat every voter as if that voter could decide a particular race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| I even mentioned that possibility of a tie to my friend, Councilman Saunders, a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| when I saw him at early voting at the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| I told him how tie votes were to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| I also called Charles Swanson, our city law director, two months ago to convey to him my very real concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| that we might have a tie vote under the circumstances of this primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| and to inform him, in case he didn't know, how a tie must be resolved under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| Because I knew then, as I know now, that city council would be reluctant to decide a tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| since they would be eyeing that part of the statute, of the controlling statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| which might allow for a runoff election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| My purpose in calling Mr. Swanson was to let him know in no uncertain terms that there was not enough time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| I reminded him that the voters at our request, and with your blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| had just moved the city primary election from the last Tuesday in September to the last Tuesday in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| because ten business days between the election day and the start of early voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| which is all we had in 2015, was insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| In fact, for that election, it is my recollection that we mailed ballots to the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| before the election was certified, not exactly how we like to conduct business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| To be honest, I had hoped that if I talked about it enough, no tie would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Now, the date for a runoff election mentioned to me has been Tuesday, September the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| After all, before the date of the city primary was moved by the city voters during our November election last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| to the last Tuesday in August, the election commission used to hold a city primary on the last Tuesday of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| So, we did it before, so why not now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| However, that, at this point in time, is impossible, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| The primary, but hardly the sole obstacle to a runoff election, is the early voting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Unless state law is changed, early voting must run 20 days before an election until five days before an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| There is no exception for a contested municipal election, but it'll run off or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| Said otherwise, for a September 26 election, early voting should have begun today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| Additionally, we were required to give notice of early voting at least five days before early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| In other words, that notice should have run in the New Sentinel last Thursday, two days after the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Also, our voting machines must be programmed for the runoff election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| a task usually completed at least a couple of weeks before early voting, or for a September 26 election around August the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| Remember that we have to deliver the machines to our early voting sites before we can vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| And let's not forget the public machine test to be conducted about that same time for a September 26 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| Of course, we send notices to the city candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| You all have gotten them before about our public machine test, and that occurs two weeks before we send them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| So that would have been around August the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Then, and this is critical, we have the intractable 45-day deadlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| which for a September 26 election would have to occur no later than August the 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| unless we would have worked overtime on Saturday, August the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| However, among other things, we have to mail out absentee voters to our military and overseas voters that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| A notice in the Knoxville New Sentinel to all voters with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| and elderly voters about their right to vote early at the Election Commission Office on Election Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| must be published 45 days before an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| In fact, you will see that particular ad in the Knoxville New Sentinel on September the 23rd for the November election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| Moreover, state law requires that we mail applications for ballots to all property-qualified voters that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| Again, 45 days before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| And I haven't even mentioned the deadlines for voters in our nursing homes and assisted living facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| I can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| I have a five-page spreadsheet, small print, with the applicable deadlines required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| The bottom line, there can be no runoff between now and the November 7th election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| which would comply with any number of these deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| So, unfortunately, you folks are still legally required by state law to break that tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| Of course, if we have a tie in November, then a runoff election in 2018 would be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| For the record, I don't think that will be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| We will have fewer candidates, and we should have a lot more voters after all of this drama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Everybody now understands, as Vice Mayor Grieve mentioned, that one vote can decide a race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| And maybe this is the first time they realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| So I'm going to stop here and see if you all have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Cliff, I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| I know we discussed this in the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Is there any possibility for a third candidate to be on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| Is there any possible way that that could happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| In the sense this way, the deadline to become a certified write-in candidate is 50 days before an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=737)|
| 0:12:26| Therefore, that would be Monday, September 18th at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| Many of you will no doubt remember that Gary Underwood was actually elected to City Council as a certified write-in candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| It is difficult, but not impossible, especially at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| So that means that that individual would not be on the ballot, but they would be certified to be a write-in candidate for the election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=764)|
| 0:12:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| In other words, their name wouldn't be on the ballot, but anybody that cast a vote for that candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| and we would have to come up with 50, 100 permutations of their last name to give benefit to any doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| they would be legally counted, in other words, so that that person could win, because all these other write-ins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| you know, we had eight write-ins in this particular race, this district race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| People took the time to go to the poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| They were counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| They were recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| We've got them if you want them, but you can't win a race unless the candidate comes in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| I want you to count my votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| I'm serious about winning this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| So those eight, none of those are certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| So you have to be certified, and you have until that Monday at noon in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| September 18th, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Any questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Any of you have any questions for Cliff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Cliff, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| We'll hear from Rob, and we may call you back up, so we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Rob Frost, who is special counsel and advisor to the city council, has been working on this also with us for the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| So, Rob, if you will explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| I'd like to let the public rest assured that we have left no stone unturned in trying to find out different possible scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=846)|
| 0:14:17| that could address the situation that we have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| As many of you all know, I used to serve city council, and actually this very district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| Everybody took this situation very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| As I posed to some people earlier, what are the odds of this number of votes being cast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| with that many number of candidates on a ballot that resulted in only the two second place candidates tying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| Those odds are probably pretty, pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| But the state law does address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| Tonight, I think you all, acting as the legislative body, need to vote in some manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| which we'll discuss shortly, to decide who is the second place candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=904)|
| 0:15:12| The charter in section 702 provides that the regular election for the office of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=912)|
| 0:15:21| shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November following the primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| That is the November 7th date that Mr. Rogers referred to, and its early voting will start on October 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| That does not include the other ballots that Mr. Rogers has discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Therefore, the date for this election is set by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Next, the charter in section 707 provides that two candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| in each district shall be placed on the regular election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| It says two candidates. It does not say three candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| It says that they shall run in the general election, which is sometimes also referred to as a regular election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| and that's what is set. That date of that, of November 7th, is set by charter section 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| Also, section 408 of the charter provides that newly elected council members shall assume the duties of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=976)|
| 0:16:25| on the third Saturday of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Late yesterday afternoon, Mayor O'Hara talked about and did a press release about potentially looking at changing the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| or having state law modified to address potential situations going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| The city charter cannot be changed very easily. The first opportunity to change it will be in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| Any action made by council, whether it's tonight or in two weeks' time, cannot be considered by the voters until 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| and even if it could be immediately considered, the rules of the election have already been set in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| and the process has already begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| This isn't a legal term, but I don't think you can switch horses in midstream at this point. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| Council, are there any questions to Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| I don't have a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| Okay, no questions. Then once we decide the procedure in terms of how—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| If you'd just like to stay on, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Mr. Vice Mayor, thank you. I do have a question because it's been mentioned so frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| and that is, I understand we have to vote, gotcha,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| but it has been mentioned that the least political way to do this would be a coin toss or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| drawing straws or something like that, and then certifying by a vote what the candidate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| so I would appreciate our attorney making a comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you, Councilman Saunders. I think we could develop a mechanism by doing a coin toss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| I think there are others. I mean, it's not just simply tossing a coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| You'd have the issue to consider who's going to toss the coin, who's going to make the call while the coin is in the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| what happens if someone flubs the coin toss, for lack of a better term, and it doesn't rotate enough to meet people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| So, I mean, it's possible, but there are other steps that I think we'd need to consider as part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| rather than simply doing a coin toss right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Once we do determine the procedure, we have asked each of the candidates to give them five minutes to make a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| and then if it's the will of Council, we've also let them know that the possibility of two supporters could be given three minutes each also on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| So, Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| I want to take this opportunity to just move this forward and make a motion to move this matter to a vote by the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1143)|
| 0:19:13| and just meaning whoever gets the simple majority of the vote of Council would advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Okay. Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Okay. Questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| I had a question about the coin toss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Have you researched to see if other cities have used this in a similar situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| I mean, the case law on tied votes don't happen very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| but if you could do a vote with the coin toss, you'd have to go through the different steps to decide how the coin was going to be tossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1185)|
| 0:19:57| Then everybody would have to agree to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Then the coin would have to be tossed, and then people would have to agree to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| You know, if Candidate A is heads and Candidate B is tails, whichever side wins, then Council would have to confirm that with a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1207)|
| 0:20:16| It'll probably land on its edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| It strikes me that even if that's in the realm of possibility of using a coin toss, we were elected by the people to do the people's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1223)|
| 0:20:34| We represent the people in our respective districts as well as the city, and they simply ask us to use our best judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| We're not always going to be right, but we're here to do a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Let's just strap it on and do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| We're trying to make an intelligent decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Yeah, I mean, I'm okay with a vote, but I think I want the public to understand, or at least this is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| that this is not an endorsement of either candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| This is simply breaking the tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| In other words, I would be displeased if a candidate that perhaps prevailed then went out and used that Council had endorsed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| because I don't see this as an endorsement at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Right, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Cliff, do you have any knowledge of coin tosses to put this to rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| Anticipating all questions for the last, actually the last few months, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| I talked to the state election coordinator, Mark Goins, about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| and the only time he mentioned that a coin toss has been utilized is when the city charter provided for a coin toss to decide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| So that's the only guidance that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Obviously our city charter here is totally silent about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| and state law just says you all have to vote, you all have to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| and gives no guidance whatsoever as to the mechanism employed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| So that's the only familiarity I have with a coin toss in the context of a municipal election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| There's been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| So be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| I'd like to jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| After the candidates and supporters speak, if that's the will of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| I would suggest a voting mechanism like has been used in years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| when, for example, when the vice mayor is elected, when the chair of the beer board is elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| or council's representative to the cap board is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| That method, for the public who might be unfamiliar with it, is it's a roll call vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| and when the member of council has their name called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| they say the name of the candidate that they wish to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| So it would be on the record how votes were cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| We will hear from the candidates, the two candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1404)|
| 0:23:34| And we'll do it by the name that was on the ballots of Ms. Parker, if you will come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| if you would like to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1419)|
| 0:23:49| We will state your name and address and when you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1429)|
| 0:24:13| Hello and good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| My name is Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I'm a resident of Fairway Road here in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| and I'm a candidate for city council in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| And, of course, I'm one of the two candidates tied for second place following the primary election on August 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| I want to thank city council for calling this special meeting this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| and showing a commitment to finding a pathway forward now that we find ourselves in a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1477)|
| 0:24:45| I've spoken before city council before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| but I never imagined that I would be here before you today asking for a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1489)|
| 0:24:58| And I do find it quite unfortunate that that's the situation that we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| I believe that voters should be the ones that choose their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| and that we should in no situation have city council members make that determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| which I see as a conflict of interest and could send the message to future candidates that they should be weary of this potential situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1515)|
| 0:25:26| and therefore limit how much they speak truth to power and the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| We do not want to see that outcome happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| And so I urge the city council to the extent possible tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| and most definitely moving forward to resolve the inadequacies of our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| and ensure that the voters from Knoxville are able to select their representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| That being said, not knowing how tonight will move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| I do want to speak for a few moments to introduce myself to those who do not know me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| and to state why I feel I should move forward in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| I grew up in Knoxville, first living in North Knoxville, attending Bell Morris Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| living on Cecil Avenue in Chickamauga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| My family moved to South Knoxville, closer to Baptist Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| where my mother worked for around 25 years before it closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Graduated from South Doyle High and the University of Tennessee with my bachelor's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| Worked at Lawson-McGee Library downtown all throughout those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| where I was able to engage and support community members throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| And then after college, I went on to law school in D.C., where I received my law degree and Master of Laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| After working for a few years at a human rights organization, I wanted to come home and be in service to my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1609)|
| 0:26:57| I moved to North Knoxville, purchased the home I loved, and have lived and worked there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| I decided to run for city council because I wanted to represent voices that have been left out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| or underrepresented in our city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| As I'm sure many of you are aware, we've never had an African-American woman on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| and I strongly believe that representation matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| Also, as the city invests in redevelopment throughout our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| I want to help ensure that the more vulnerable parts of our community and their needs are prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Our elderly members, folks living paycheck to paycheck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| those with disabilities and health challenges, our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| I want to be a part of creating a city that works for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| I've also been a part of a movement, the 2017 City Council Movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| a movement of people also wanting to see a people-centered city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| And at this time, I'd like to ask everyone who's here to support me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| who's here as a part of the City Council Movement, to stand and be acknowledged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| because it is your hard work that has gotten me this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| We began this campaign in May, and with just a little over $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| we were able to earn the 488 votes that we earned last August, the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| Ms. Parker, you have less than a minute. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Oh, that's more than I thought. Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| So with our people power, with the little bit of change that we had in our pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| and some wonderful donors, we've been able to tie with a well-respected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| much-beloved, long-term-serving former state rep, Harry Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| And so I'm very proud of the work that we put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| I'm very grateful for all of the support and for everyone coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| And I ask that I be allowed to move forward in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1752)|
| 0:29:24| It's the will of the Council. We'll have two supporters for each. Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| I would suggest we let two others speak on their behalf for about, what, two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| If it's the will of my colleague, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Second? Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Okay. All those in favor, you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| I would like to hear the other candidate, and then I think we should hear two per side or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Our legal counsel has recommended that we go ahead and have the supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Our traditional way of hearing a matter at counsel is three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| And don't cross over. It's fine. Just the gesture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| There's been a motion and a second. All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Opposed? Okay. The ayes have it, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Ms. Parker, if you have two individuals that would like to speak on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| It's not required, but you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| Two minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1831)|
| 0:30:44| If you will state your name and address, you'll have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Okay. I won't need nearly that much, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| My name is Jared Crum, and I live at Brooks Road, 2415.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| Brooks Avenue, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| I just want to speak briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| My support for Amelia comes from a personal connection to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| She's a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| She's a voice and a very steady advocate for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| Her voice is one of reason, one of logic, one of a tempered approach to leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| And I really think that this body will be empowered to have her presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| And I think the city would be proud to make this historic move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| And in addition to that, we can go to very new and innovative places with her leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| My name is Alex Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I live at 2514 Underwood Place off of Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I wasn't prepared to speak tonight, but I just wanted to say a few things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| partly to follow up on what Amelia said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| and partly to respond to what Mr. Rogers said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| because I actually think contrary to being disappointed in the voter turnout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| we should be celebrating the fact that we've broken records for voter turnout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| that we tripled the turnout that we had in our district during the previous primary in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| and doubled from the time before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| And I think we can conclude partly from this that people want to be more involved with their city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| want to have a say in how it's run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| And I think based on my experience talking to hundreds of voters in our district over the past couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| that several hundred people turned out to vote for Amelia who I believe wouldn't have voted otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| because they believed in her message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| And I think I can't tell you how many people I spoke to while doorknocking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| and making calls who had no idea that an election was happening because the media hadn't told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| They hadn't heard it from the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| And many who had heard of it felt that their interests weren't being represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| in the city government and said that they usually don't vote because they don't believe it accomplishes anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| They don't believe that they're being represented, their needs are being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| And I think so many of those people were won over by Amelia and by her message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| and came out to vote for a candidate they believed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| believing that they could be heard in the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| and that they could get involved and that they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| And I think I'm excited about that momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| I'm excited to see so many more people, even if it's not where we would want it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| it's growing and I think it will continue to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| who want to be involved in city politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And I think the voices of those people should have a chance to be heard in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2011)|
| 0:33:46| If you'll state your name and address, you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Harry Tindall, 5104 Spring Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| That's in the 1-7 zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Thank you all for your service and thank you for taking on this issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| I know a lot of you were busy Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| and this has been a week of second chances here in Rocky Top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| and tonight I'm asking that you all give me a second chance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| I would appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| I'm kind of a numbers person, those that know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| I like spreadsheets and budgets and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| It's not going to be the whole of my presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| but I think there's some interesting numbers here that I'd like to give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| In terms of the election, we did have a turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| which was about three times the last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| and I applaud all five candidates for helping to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| It was good, but it wasn't as many as we wanted, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| In this district, the two candidates in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| I had two first-place finishes out of eight precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| I had four second-place finishes out of eight precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| and two third-place finishes out of eight precincts compared to the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| That was more first places, more second places, and fewer third places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| In terms of how the vote comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| we have absentee votes, early votes, and election day votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| I carried, in this context, the absentee vote and the early vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| My very worthy competitor carried the election day vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| and people like Alex did a great job for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| In terms of who I am, some of you know me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| because I have been around for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| I'm a lifelong Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| This is a really good day for Bell Morris Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| because I went there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| and went on to Whittle Springs and Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| before graduating with a business degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| from the University of Tennessee here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| I am a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I work in the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| selling a group of health insurance to small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and I also do consulting work, as many of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| I know that experience in the community is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and I've had that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| As I think was alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| I served 11 terms in the State House of Representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| serving much of this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| I also served before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| I was elected twice to the Knox County School Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| serving the similar geographic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| I had plenty of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| servicing the needs of the constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| working with neighborhoods, working with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| working with businesses, working with government leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| to solve real problems on behalf of the people that I represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| and I think that that experience could be valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| in this election going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| In terms of my philosophy of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| which I would bring to the City Council if elected by the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| I believe in working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I believe in inclusiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I believe in dialogue, in collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| I think that the most complex problems and the best solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| come from working together and bringing multiple voices in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I think anybody that has researched my record in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| knows that that's something that I strive to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| and have a bit of a reputation for doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| In terms of this election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| it's important also to look at what is at stake here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| With term limits, we're going to get a new City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| I like to liken that to a relay race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| where you have runners passing the baton to the next runner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| This council is going to pass the baton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| on a number of issues to the new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I think there are some things you all have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| just three, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| would be the Magnolia Avenue corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| the Recode Knoxville project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| and also the traffic signalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| and the mass transit issue that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| in the Broadway corridor in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Those are things that may not be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| by the time this council finishes its term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| and I stand ready to help complete those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| and take them across the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| In terms of other projects, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| the new council will come up with many, many ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| and those will become the next part of the race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| as that council moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Some of the things I feel strongly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| are we've got to grow our economy in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| in order to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Knoxville's success is not only just Knoxville's success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| it's also Knox County's success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| as a good deal of the funding for our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| comes from the success that occurs right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Also, we're an economic engine and a driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| for the state of Tennessee, so what we do is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| I want to continue to grow our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| not just for the tax revenue, but for the jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| the opportunities, the amenities, and the choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| that brings our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| To sum it up, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I would appreciate the opportunity to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| and if given the opportunity to be on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I promise to work hard to uphold the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| I've discussed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| and to be a good representative of the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you very much. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| You have two supporters that would like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| You're welcome to do so at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| If it pleases the chair, I would like to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| one, I did not contact any council member in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and we did not plan anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| There are a number of people that do support me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| and there's a couple of them that, on an impromptu basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| would say a word, and I would allow you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| That's fine if you'll bring them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Mr. Robbie Arrington and Sylvia Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Ms. Sylvia Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| State your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Hi, I'm Robbie Arrington, 5403 Lindale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| I won't need two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| I wanted to get up here and just vouch for Harry Tindall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| everything he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I've known him for 18 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| When he was my state representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| I was calling our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| on issues I was passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| He was one of the only ones who returned my call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Not only returned my call, but was very engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| over the next five, seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| as we talked about different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Since then, we've met while he was in state rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| and since then, when he was looking at running for this office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| encouraging him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and the same passion that he just spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| I believe he'll bring that to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| and also be very approachable by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| and the 4th District and the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| So thanks for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| If you will state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| you'll have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| My name is Sylvia Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I live at 412 East Moody Avenue in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| I met Harry many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| and all of you all know that I'm a part of the Democrat Party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| and have been for most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| I met him, he was a young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| and he wanted to fill a vacancy on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| And we listened to the people, and I started supporting him then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| And all throughout the years and all his political life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| I have supported him because I knew I could depend on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| He doesn't live in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| but because of my job I was able to work with lots of candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| as many of you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| I've always been proud of my support of Harry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| He has the respect of Democrats and Republicans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| and I listened to what he said in his philosophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| and I can tell you that I know this to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| I've watched him over the years, and I'm real proud of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| And I would ask that your vote for Harry for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| It would help our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. Vice Mayor, before we vote, let me say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I appreciate the candidates coming forward tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| As a matter of fact, I think it's stunning that we've had 30 candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| in this last city council election contest in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| And I think everybody up here knows how daunting it is to put yourself out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| before the public, win or lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| You take a risk and you expose yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| and voters either vote for you or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| So please, whatever occurs tonight, those that may not prevail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| please remain engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| And I am so confounded by the disengagement we've seen on some hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| And on the other hand, the engagement that we're seeing right here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| So I am proud of all of those who stood up and ran, exposed themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| and took the chance to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| And I encourage you going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Mr. Saunders, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I think we can all agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Are there any other comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Rob, you have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I just wanted to briefly follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| The resolution that you all will be voting on shortly here is contingent upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| the Knox County Election Commission at its meeting, which is on or about September 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| making the presently unofficial results official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| If there is something unanticipated, I mean, Mr. Rogers, if you ask him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| he will say he believes the unofficial votes will become the official votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| and if something happens and anything other than a tie occurs at the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2592)|
| 0:43:20| when they become the final votes, then we might have to come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| But this is contingent upon the current election results becoming the official election results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| when the election commission meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Is council ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I don't know if you'll read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Councilman Dela Vove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| I just wanted to footnote something to what Rob said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| and that is that it was impressed upon us last year how important it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| and how difficult it is for the election commission to get those certified ballots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| out to the military overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| And that is why we moved that primary to an earlier date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| And I think all of this effort, including the contingent voting and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| is to be in a position to facilitate that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| I think the magic date is somewhere around September 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| where they have to literally put those ballots in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| But we're working like everyone else is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| with Expedition to try to fulfill the terms of that federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| as well as our own charter and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| I just want to thank my colleagues for being here and trying to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170906?start=2675)|
