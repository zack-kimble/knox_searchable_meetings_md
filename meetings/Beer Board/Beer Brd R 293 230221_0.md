| 0:16:42| So, you know, we're looking to, we were hoping to be open before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| this ended this time, but it kind of pushed us back a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| So, you know, I'd say 120 days we should be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| everything done so we wouldn't have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I know that your last fingerprint and background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| check was last March, so we're approaching a year again of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| So, I guess two years of extending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| So, I'll turn it to my colleagues for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| So, 120 days would take us to May, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| March, April, May, June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| June, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Would you be willing to do another background check in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Yeah, I've done two already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1053)|
| 0:17:33| I've done one a couple of times ago, I think, and then I've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| The last one was March 18th of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Would you be willing to take another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I think this would be the final extension that I'm willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| support for 120 days, so that's the motion I would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I wanted to ask Sergeant Cowan, typically, and just refresh my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| memory, we have requested the additional background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| once they've reached close to a year or a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| I kind of want us to maybe look, consider maybe at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| establishing a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| It's always been if they've gone past a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Right, we approve pending final document, or this body approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| pending final documentation of July 28th of 1920, I mean 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| None of us were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Not good for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| So, anyway, just for reference that, you know, we're approaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| three years, honestly, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Okay, so we've got a motion to extend for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1134)|

| 0:18:58| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1138)|

| 0:19:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| All right, good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Okay, next is Lunaverse, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| Do we have anyone from Lunaverse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| Mr. Byrd, have you been in touch with anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| I saw Ms. West, I think, Friday, Thursday or Friday in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1170)|
| 0:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| Okay, we'll move through the agenda and she may show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| We'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| 5D is the Humble Hog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1180)|
| 0:19:55| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Hello, my name is Benjamin Grice and I'm the owner of the Humble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Hog and we are under construction at 312 South Gay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Street and that is why I'm here for the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Well, we just finally got our permit, so it's going great now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| We're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We're about to have our framing inspection coming up, so things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| are looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| If I had to guess, I would say a 90-day extension would cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| My hope is far less, but we still have to put the grease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| interceptor into the basement as well, so there's quite a bit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| do left, but I'd say things are right on schedule as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| you know, from the time we got the permit to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| now, so that's encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| All right, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Sir, it sounds like even with, you said you still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| install the grease trap part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Yeah, the big tank that goes in the ground, it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Would you be okay with 120 days if you get it done within 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| That's even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| That's a great suggestion, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| And if we're done faster, there's no penalty, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1269)|
| 0:21:09| Then you wouldn't have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| I'd be comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1272)|
| 0:21:12| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| With that said, I will move to extend 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| All right, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1287)|

| 0:21:48| We are turning, so our landlord had completed part of our build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| out and that is all complete and now we're putting in electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| So we expect it to hopefully be done in the next week or two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| then inspections will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| So I think we were requesting a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1328)|

| 0:23:09| I don't think I saw anyone come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| So I propose we defer to the March beer board meeting or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1393)|
| 0:23:24| anyone has another suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230221?start=1404)|
