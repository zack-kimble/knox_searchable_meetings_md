| 2:05:44| But, you know, we kind of sometimes take the work that the Finance Department does for granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:52| but, you know, for these 13 years, an overwhelming majority of those years were done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| without any kind of increase from the prior year in terms of budget and tax increases and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| But for the entire Finance Department, I'd like to ask them all to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| You know, and they kind of take a beating from us at least annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| but more often than that probably mid-year and every quarter and sometimes every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| They've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| But to have them recognized by their national organization is pretty spectacular for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| but they've done this 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| So we really appreciate, we may not always say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| but we really appreciate the job that you all do for the entire Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| Well, I want to echo Commissioner McKenzie's sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| When he said outstanding, he was right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| They do an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| And sometimes during economic downturns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| I think some of us think it's the problem with the Finance Department that they've created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| and they're just like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| They're trying to manage their way through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| But I thought this past year they did an exceptionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| exceptionally good job in a very difficult budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| And to receive this type of recognition and praise from the professional organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| for so many years in a row speaks volumes about the professionals that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| and the good work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| And one other thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| When you look at groups like this, it doesn't happen because you wish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| It happens because you've really got outstanding leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| And we're very fortunate to have John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| Senior Director of Finance for Knox County, who does an exceptionally good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| And I appreciate John and all the fine work that his team does, not just for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| but each and every year and each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| We're very fortunate to have them as a part of our team in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| I wanted to echo those same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| For those of us that are somewhat challenged sometimes in the higher realms of finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| I certainly appreciate this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| They've been very receptive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| And I hope that if you walk up there and you walk through the halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| you'll see all of the awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| The awards of this department are numerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| And so it does reflect on the type of staff that John has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| And I hope you'll mention each individual name as he approaches this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Just one remark, and we'll hear a little bit more about this later in the audit committee report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| But in the audit this year from KPMG, we've got, of course, an unqualified opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| which is exactly what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| But the auditor, KPMG, went even further in praising this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| for its work on the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, which I hope all of you have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| It's a rather lengthy document, but it is very thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| and takes incredible knowledge and effort to put this thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| And they did not need to make mention of that in their report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| but they made mention of it here verbally at the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| So I wanted to pass that along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| I've got a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| I'm very thankful for the hard work that they do and just do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:16| 107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7756)|

| 2:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| This group of young men is not only outstanding golfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| They're outstanding in the classroom, in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| I know several of these young men personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| I know how hard they work year-round on golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| And I know that there's a couple of honor students here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| And, in fact, we even have one gentleman here that may be the best three-point shooter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:35| outside of Chris Lofton that I've seen, Taylor Deagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| If you ever get a chance to watch Farragut High School play basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| Taylor, I've had a chance to coach against him and with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| And he's not only an outstanding athlete but an outstanding gentleman along with these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7970)|
| 2:12:56| They show up to the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| They're a close-knit group of young men that cheer each other on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| And I just think what they do not only on the golf course but in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| and what they do in the community is to be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| And I appreciate what the coach has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| And I appreciate all these young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| And although three of them have signed scholarships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| I know several of the underclassmen are being recruited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| And we'll just ñ Mayor, would you like to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| Just very quickly, I can make a three-point basket every now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| but I can never shoot par like these guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| And Commissioner Norman can absolutely attest to that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| And, of course, Commissioner, I won't allude to your golf game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| so I'm going to give both of us a little pass there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| But they're great athletes, but they're great young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| And like Commissioner Luto said, I know several of them, their moms and dads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| and how hard they work to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| So I'm very proud of them, and I know you share that pride in their accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| But it's one thing to be a good golfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| but it's something else to have great sportsmanship and be good in academics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| and care about your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| And these young folks do all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| So if you'd please join me in giving them a warm round of applause, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:22| Well, I try to do the best I can as far as tutoring them on the run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| Dr. McKenzie, did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| Just congratulations to the young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| As all have said, wonderful student-athletes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| and we appreciate their work in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| We appreciate their work on the field of competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| And if you ever doubt that the Knox County Schools develops young men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| and women who are confident, I asked them about their state tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| and said, well, where do you play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| And they told me, and I said, well, who is your competition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| They said, well, we really didn't have any competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| So they've done a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| They've done a great job in golf, but they've done a great job in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| and we're very proud of them and look forward to their many accomplishments in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| And if they'd each come up and just introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8110)|
| 2:15:17| I'm Hayden Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| Davis Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| I'm Brandon Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| I'm Mitchell Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| I'm Stuart Thomas, and we're not related anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| I'm Taylor Deagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8134)|
| 2:15:45| We have several names on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| Harvey Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| Harvey Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| Sam Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8156)|
| 2:16:03| To the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| My name is Sam Mayo, 1304 Beacon Hill Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:27| What I wanted to talk to you about today is I wanted to ask you to help out our hometown school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:36| the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| They need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| As you know, UT is landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| They have homes to the north, a river to the south, and convention center and hotel to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8207)|
| 2:17:00| Over the next hundred years, I suspect, I hope, that UT will need additional land to expand their teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8220)|
| 2:17:10| and research facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| However, as I speak today, there are consultants who are being paid to turn the only remaining avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:27| for campus expansion, which is Cherokee Farm, into hotels, convention centers, and private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:41| If they proceed, then UT will lose their only avenue for campus expansion permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:53| If you guys don't act on this soon, it's going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8273)|
| 2:18:00| Now, some of you all, I think, work at UT, and some have family who work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:08| You know how cramped and crowded a lot of the facilities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| I mean, there's just not much room to expand, and a lot of classrooms are cramped and crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:23| So to remedy this problem, all you have to do is ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:33| Who is the law director here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| Is there a law person here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| All you have to do is ask the law director to go to court and to change the reversion clause in the original Cherokee Farm deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:52| to state that the land can only be used for teaching and research, and it cannot be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8332)|
| 2:19:05| I included the ASP group, audiology, speech pathology, just as an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:13| It would be something you could attach to that as an amendment to guarantee their funding forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:25| And I talked to Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| I think you all know Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| I'd never met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| He said he couldn't be here today because I think he said he was going to be chained to a tree in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:41| But he did say, I mean, we did some rough estimates, and he said he didn't know for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| but the facility speech pathology sees maybe 500 to 1,000 people per year, patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8388)|
| 2:20:01| So, you know, if our kids have an 80-year life expectancy, that would be 80,000 patients in a rather short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:12| So I've talked to a couple of local attorneys, and they say that Knox County has a very good case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8412)|
| 2:20:24| if they wish to amend these deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| And I guess it's just a simple request from you to your law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:37| to ensure this property is in safekeeping for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Mr. Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| Mr. Sam, over here, Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| Back, I guess, nine or ten months ago, you brought this issue up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| You sent some letters out, and you spoke to Sequoia Hills Association at the Presbyterian Church, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:08| Do you recall that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| And along that time, that was again probably about March, I sent your documents to Bill Lockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:19| who is our law director, who does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| He's not at the meetings usually now, but of course Joe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| And he said he had had a conversation with you, this being back about ten months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| probably March of last year, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| Do you recall having talked to Director Lockett about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| He acted like it wasn't as simple as you possibly may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| No, I didn't talk to Bill, but I did hear secondhand through an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:50| that there is documentation in the Knox County Archives disputing the quick claim deed of 1945, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8510)|
| 2:22:04| But that's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| I didn't talk to Bill about it, but I know that the quick claim deed was disputed in 1945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8528)|
| 2:22:15| And, you know, it's just something, you know, I don't know that it would be easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| but I think it would be inexpensive and I think it would be a fight worth fighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:27| if you all chose to ask your law director to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| You never know what the judge is going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| I don't know if our judges are from Tennessee or Alabama or where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| but it's just I think it would be very worthwhile to protect this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8560)|
| 2:22:46| because, you know, I think, you know, UT's intentions are good at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| but they're going through a period of change, upheaval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| They've had, what, three presidents in the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| and they don't have a president at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| And, you know, I think they need your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| I think you all are in a better position to safeguard that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| than the University of Tennessee is for our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| You know, if Andy Holt was still here, I wouldn't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| But, you know, things have changed over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| and I just would like you to, for the sake of our kids and the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| I hope that you would take the simple step to request your law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| to look into this matter, win or lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Thank you for bringing it to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| Like Commissioner Shouse, I also checked when I got that letter some months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| with Law Director Lockett before the changeover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| and he told me he did research it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| and that there was a second deed signed that it was all, you know, well and done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:11| But there was no recourse because there was a second deed signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| He could have been referring to a quitclaim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| Now, I don't know about quitclaim deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| I know I read an article back in the 80s in the Wall Street Journal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| where there was a problem with those deeds nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| and that people were filing them against former spouses or friends or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:40| and they were really clogging up the system just filing malicious quitclaims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:47| I went to Office Depot last night, and I bought a 24-pack of quitclaim deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:55| and I was thinking about for illustration filing one on all of your homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| and then ask you why I didn't get your home for a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| and the UT gets a $50 million piece of property for $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| Sam, what's your connection with the University of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:26| Well, I sold my basketball tickets this year, but I sold my football tickets in 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:35| Are you representing the University of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| Have you taken this to the trustees of the University of Tennessee and asked them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| I certainly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| I've talked to them on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| I've sat down and met with them, and I worked at UT for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:57| and what I noticed quickly about UT, the administration there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:04| is that they're great people, very talented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| but I think they perceive UT as their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| They're not trustees or custodians or barely employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| They seem to me to feel like they own the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| and it was there for their benefit, and they're very possessive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:31| I didn't make any headway with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| It just seemed to be they'd made up their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| and come whatever they were going to do with that farm what they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:44| I'm a former alumni president for the University of Tennessee for the Knoxville chapter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| and unless the board of trustees come to us and say, you know, we need your help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| and I was in on part of these early drawings and stuff on the Cherokee farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| I don't know what they're doing over there, and they've got a game plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| and I thoroughly trust their legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| Well, they do have a game plan, but it's shifting all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| You know, they were going to put in a $4 billion research park there just last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| and today they're just talking about developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:20| and possibly selling part of the property for a hotel and convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| And, of course, this facility would compete with our own convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:30| and I think we have tax dollars obligated to make up for any shortfall at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:38| So they would be just competing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| And, no, they don't need to come to your house and ask you for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| I mean, they've got things in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| It's you guys that need to ask the law director and you alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| There's nobody else that needs to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| I don't know if it takes one person or how many, but it's only you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8877)|
| 2:28:02| You're the only people here that can make a change on the outcome of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:13| It's you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| And all you have to do is ask your law director to go to court and do his best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| You can always change your mind in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| You might want to, you know, do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| But, you know, once that farm's gone, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8907)|

| 2:29:48| Maybe he will, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=8988)|

| 2:30:53| I'm friendly to everything involving the FOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| I need your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| I was here on the stormwater issue last month on the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| with my house being flooded out because of what my neighbor has done with his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9080)|
| 2:31:27| I'm still here today with the same issue, but I've talked to stormwater up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| and Bruce Weitrick, he has assured me they would be out there within eight to ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| to try to resolve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| I was here to talk about a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| One of my major issues is the property across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| I was going to ask a question, and I talked to Brad about it right before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| was who's responsible for the damage done to my home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| Would it be Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| Would it be this, you know, the guy that lives across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| Considering that Knox County is the one that put the drain line in, the drain system in, which is bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:18| who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| That's what I'm here to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| You know, Mr. Armstrong, last time he said somebody is responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| and that's what I'm here to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| Who is responsible for the damage done to my home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:35| Can anybody on this body tell me who would be the responsible person for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:42| Brad also said right before the meeting, somebody is responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| And so that's what I was here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| The drainage system is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| I've got major pictures of the drainage system that was put in by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| but this was before the guy built the parking lot and the golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| and everything else there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| The drainage system was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| At that point, the drainage system seemed like it was doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| We didn't have water problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| But since the guy has raised and put the golf parking lot in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| and the driving range and the practice greens and all this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| and reverted the water to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| the drainage system is not collecting any of the water whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| Yesterday I went over there and I took pictures, and, you know, we had some storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| And I went over there and I took pictures of the drainage system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| and you can see the water is just running around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| where the water is supposed to be drained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| This drainage system was put in to where the man didn't have to mow a ditch line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:48| He put a culvert draining system in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| It was put in by Knox County to where he did not have to mow a ditch line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| He just could take a big mower and go right straight down over it with no problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| blow the grass out into the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| He's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| But now the problem is my house yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| I had six and a half inches of water in my garage yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| I had a foot and a half of water underneath my house yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:21| The water that was coming across the street was four and a half inches deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| rolling across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| This is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| I mean, my house is damaged, damaged bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| We had contractors that come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| They said, we cannot even give you an estimate on how much damage is done to this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9279)|
| 2:34:45| until you stop that water, until somebody stops that water coming underneath your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9285)|
| 2:34:52| So I've done some further investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| and this man has done 90% of this work illegally, without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9296)|
| 2:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| He finally went to and got a use on review not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9305)|
| 2:35:12| Well, I've done some checking, and I went to the tax department here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9312)|
| 2:35:20| and found out that the man was being taxed on commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| And I said, how come he's being taxed on commercial property when it's ag property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| I said, I don't understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| And he said, well, when it gets to the size of that, we'll take one acre and tax it commercially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:39| to get our tax money out of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| Well, that tells me that a use on review is being used as, hey, let this business move on in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:50| We're going to tax it in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| We're going to get our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| But we're going to light it up as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| So my question, and I asked Brad this, is can this body not pull a use on review for further investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9356)|
| 2:36:05| until this man has been made responsible for what he's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| Or can it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| I mean, he said it had to be directed to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| If this man, this use on review can be took away until the water problem is stopped and fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9378)|
| 2:36:27| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| It's not all just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| It is, you know, what he's done to the property over there and overloaded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| Now we're going to spend quite a bit of money, Knox County is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| trying to fix this problem that was caused by two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| That was caused by Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission for granting him a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| knowing that he had done all of this stuff prior to them giving him the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| And then, you know, I go tax, is use on review giving these people the right to take it commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9417)|
| 2:37:05| full-blown commercial properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| I mean, that's what the tax director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| He said we took one acre and zoned it commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| He taxed it commercial because it is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| And I said, well, why'd you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| He said because the magnetism of this business, the size of this business, makes it a taxable business as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:27| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| I mean, one body's telling me one thing, one body's telling me another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| Is there anybody that can clarify this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| I just asked a question to the law director, and I would like for an answer to be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| Can a use on review be pulled by the Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9463)|
| 2:37:48| Can anybody answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| I think we have some lights on that some people want to ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| Yeah, I just wanted to ask Mr. Jarrett, I think he had stepped out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9478)|
| 2:38:02| I just wanted to get Mr. Conrad's answer for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9482)|
| 2:38:06| I don't believe that, I believe circuit court's the remedy for use on review, but I'll have to check with Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:16| Mr. Conrad, I'll get you just for time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| Grant, do you have the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| Are you talking about an appeal of a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:26| That goes to Chancellor Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:28| That's what I assumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| But, Mr. Conrad, I mean, you'll get together and we'll discuss what your options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| And I believe the appeal does go to, as far as commission pulling the use on review, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| It's a done deal until Chancellor Court overturns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| But is a use on review being used to justify putting a commercial piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:55| a commercial business, in an agriculture zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| If they tax it commercial and they're getting commercial tax from it, then they know that the business is a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:07| I think that's the purpose of the review is to determine whether or not it's feasible for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| But I think that your questions will have to be answered by an attorney and a judge and a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| Because once it goes to BZA, it's out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| Jennifer Mertes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| Could you name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| My name is Jennifer Mertes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| It's M-I-R-T-E-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| I live at 606 Hines Court, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| And the reason that I'm here today, I work for a company called SecureWatch LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| We're the second largest authorized dealer of ADT in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:53| I'm here today to possibly change the solicitor peddlers laws here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| Currently, for each of our consultants to work door-to-door, we have to pay $60 a month, not a year, a month, in order to do door-to-door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:08| I understand Knox County put that law into place because businesses were sending people from out of town in to do door-to-door sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9608)|
| 2:40:16| We had rapes, murders, you know, assaults happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| From the research that I've done, any local business that does do door-to-door sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| there's nothing on record saying that we've had that kind of problem from local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| Those problems came in from outside sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| So what I'm trying to do today is either change the law or amend the law to where if you do have a local business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:37| it can show you that we have, you know, property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| For instance, my business is at 120 South Gay Street, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| Our dealer is 106, what is it, 7067631.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9644)|
| 2:40:50| Our commercial license is 1403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| You know, for our business, we are, you know, we have obtained the proper permits to do what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9652)|
| 2:40:57| but for the consultants to have to pay $60 a month, that's kind of steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| What we would like to work out with the city and the council is that our company, SecureWatch, would pay a yearly fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:07| plus allow for our company to provide a $10 background check on each and every one of our consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:13| If they do come up with any kind of felonies, they are not allowed to work for our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| Of course, you know, we are about keeping the community safe, and, you know, we just go out and make people safe for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| Back in December at the Knoxville News Sentinel, December 15th, the article read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9682)|
| 2:41:26| medical alert button spooks home invader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| We do believe that that was one of our systems that we put into somebody's home, another way to protect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| For anyone that knows me, they know that I'm a big community person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| I'm very passionate about taking care of people and doing what's right for the city and for the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9697)|
| 2:41:42| I have a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| I get to go around and make people safe for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| And in this day and age, I am a true believer that everyone should have some kind of home security in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| The $60 a month, that's awfully steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| You know, to ask, I would feel definitely to keep that in place for outside businesses that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9715)|
| 2:42:01| busing people in or flying people in to do the, you know, magazine sale type situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9721)|
| 2:42:07| which most of the time, those are all shady businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| We are a reputable company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| We have a terrific reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| And I'd like to see something changed with this to make it more easy for our consultants to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| and do the door-to-door sales, okay, and not have to pay $60 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| What you're asking us for is something pretty big that would need to be addressed in the form of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:39| I would not be opposed to doing something that would make it less expensive for local established businesses to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:50| business and at the very same time make it even more expensive for these out-of-town predatory businesses to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:59| I mean, I wonder if some of these kids selling magazine subscription and the knickknacks that they show up showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9779)|
| 2:43:05| I wonder if these poor kids are even getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| You know, I think they're fly-by-night predatory type operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| So if we could do something in the sense where we maybe get a little laxer on local businesses that are established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:19| that have an address, that have an Ox County business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| and at the same time tighten up on some of these more predatory businesses, I would be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9802)|
| 2:43:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| And if you'll contact me, I'll sit down with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| and maybe we can come up with something that I could bring before or maybe myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| and someone else could bring before commission in a month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| But it is a pretty big thing that you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| Yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| I was going to say Jennifer is one of the neighborhood watch leaders in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| and there is no one more up on safety than Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9833)|
| 2:44:01| She knows her stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| In fact, if there would be a time, maybe, Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| that you could get together with Mr. Lambert and myself and Joe Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:12| and look over what the current ordinance is and see how we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| I'm thinking along the same lines that Commissioner Lambert is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| to make it a little easier for local businesses that are well established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| And I wouldn't object at all to making it more difficult for these companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| that bring people in from out of town because they are the ones that seem to be causing all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| How many employees do you have right now that go door to door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| We have anywhere from 35 to 45 at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| And $60 a month that they each have to pay is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| And when we do work out in the field, the reason I dress this way today is this is how each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9888)|
| 2:44:53| and every one of our consultants dress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| We do carry our IDs with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| We are fully labeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| And we are even transported in a vehicle that does say SecureWatch ADT on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| So when we are out in the field, it is very, very apparent on who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| Now, this is probably a question that you don't have an answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| but something that we might need to look at, too, while we're talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Do you know how many other local businesses there are that do the kind of door-to-door work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| that you engage in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| Are there many locally, or are most of them the out-of-town groups that come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| Most of them are the out-of-town groups that do come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| There are some local companies that are also authorized dealers of some type of home security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| I've never seen them be as organized as our company is based on how we dress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| and how we work in a team base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| From what I understand, any other authorized dealers of ADT in just Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| they may bring in maybe 30 deals a month when we're doing that a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9946)|
| 2:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| So thank you for coming today and bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| Commissioner Hammond, you have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| What does the city ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| I'm sure you do business in the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| What does the city require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| The city requires us to follow the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| Okay, so whatever we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| So if you're doing, okay, that's all I need now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| Brad's still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| I think he had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| He may be back, but I think he had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| We take about a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| I was getting ready to ask if you wanted to take a break or dive into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| We're going to take a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=9998)|
| 2:47:08| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=10028)|
| 2:47:38| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=10058)|
| 2:48:08| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=10088)|
| 2:48:38| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=10118)|
| 2:49:08| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=10148)|
| 2:49:38| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=10178)|

| 3:03:20| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| We've had two public forums since we had our last meeting in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| and I want to go back over just a few of the problems we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| and try to focus on what the real purpose is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| the real purpose of us addressing this problem with the recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11015)|
| 3:03:40| We've sometimes gotten off track thinking that it was ways to either make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11020)|
| 3:03:45| easier to recall an official or make it more difficult to recall an official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| but the reason that this was brought up is because there's some significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| technical problems with the present recall ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| You know, one is that in the ordinance it was labeled wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| It was labeled in the wrong paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| That's relatively easy to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| And the second thing is that we've got a technical problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11046)|
| 3:04:09| in that there was two questions that required answering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| and you can't answer two questions with a one-question answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| So we needed to correct those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| While we were here correcting those two things that I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11061)|
| 3:04:27| we have the opportunity to really get back to the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| is do we want to do anything else with the recall amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11071)|
| 3:04:34| I want to point out, and I think this has been corrected in one part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11074)|
| 3:04:39| and this is really addressed at the law director, it gets with paragraph F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:42| and that's where we really have a contradiction where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11082)|
| 3:04:45| and this is still what was on the agenda today, so this will need to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| This is just a little wordsmithing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| We put, if a majority of the voters vote no, the incumbents shall remain in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11092)|
| 3:04:56| If a majority of the voters vote yes, the incumbent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| and the question is what happens if they're a tie and there is no majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| And the way that we had decided, and I think everyone would agree with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| we'll just do away with that first sentence and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| if a majority of the voters vote yes, then Kermit should be deemed recalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| and I think we agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| And then the second issue that we need to address is determining the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:22| signatures that will be required to have an official placed on the ballot for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| In the ordinance that we passed on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| and we had a long discussion of this at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| and we've had discussions at both of the public forums on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11134)|
| 3:05:40| we presently have where it's, let me bring this back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:45| I think it's 25 percent of the people at the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11145)|
| 3:05:51| There's some problems with that that's come up that we picked up in the first public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11151)|
| 3:05:58| or maybe it was the second public forum, I don't recall now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| but that there's some precincts that are split precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11161)|
| 3:06:05| and you really don't know how many people voted in that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| So I think that that's going to be a number that we need to try to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| We can talk about this, but there's no good way to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| A couple of other of the points that have been brought out by people at the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11179)|
| 3:06:23| either commissioners or by citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| should we have people that sign the signature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| that sign their signature to recall an official only be the people that voted in the election in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11189)|
| 3:06:36| By that, I don't mean the registered voters, and using a number, but actually the people that voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| And there's no way to determine who voted and who didn't vote because we have a secret ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:45| Just because a person signs in, goes in and votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| we don't know who voted in that election and who we don't and who didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| The other question that came up at one of the four, and so I think that's something that can't be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11213)|
| 3:06:59| and it would be very difficult anyway to try to track those people down, even if you did know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| but we don't know because of secret ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| The second one that came up, and I think it was Commissioner Wright at the last public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11225)|
| 3:07:10| dealt with dealing with having the number of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11230)|
| 3:07:15| If we go back to that criterion on January 1st of that year, you know, I think that that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11235)|
| 3:07:23| But even then, because we don't purge the voters, purge the rolls at that particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11243)|
| 3:07:31| you really don't know who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11251)|
| 3:07:32| You have a pretty close number, but you really don't know how many people that are on the rolls to be registered to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11252)|
| 3:07:39| even live in the county and really and truly are still eligible to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:44| And I think to try to get the most accurate number, we need to somehow get back to the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| that voted in that particular election for that particular person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11269)|
| 3:07:53| And, you know, of course, this is all open to discussion and debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:59| And the number that we're dealing with that I think would be, and we can decide on the percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11279)|
| 3:08:04| whether we want 25, which is what 25 percent of the people that voted in the election in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11284)|
| 3:08:09| which is used by more states than any other number, or we want to use 50, which I had initially proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11289)|
| 3:08:16| Someone else said 51, 55, or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11296)|
| 3:08:20| I think these are the numbers that we can debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| And I just wanted to give that as a preface to any discussion on really where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11303)|
| 3:08:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:38| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| Regarding the two issues I think could be divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| and I think we should divide the issues as to changing the number of questions on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11327)|
| 3:08:53| I think we could probably do that fairly easily today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:58| So I am going to ask that the question be divided so that we can approve at least part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11338)|
| 3:09:06| and then come back and discuss the number of signatures and how you get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:12| And I'd like to make that as part of the motion to approve the first part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:17| which is everything except for with the change that Dr. Briggs brought about the majority voting in favor of the recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11357)|
| 3:09:30| and then come back with how we deal with the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:35| You know, I think we did that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| And so we can keep this as part of the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| I believe that would be a second reading if we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| So I'd like to make that a form of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| The first part is to approve the ordinance amending the majority of the vote that Dr. Briggs discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11386)|
| 3:09:57| and everything except for the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11400)|
| 3:10:01| I want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| Does that keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11405)|
| 3:10:06| I know at one point you said it doesn't change it substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| We could stay on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| Does that meet that threshold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| Yes, sir, I believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11414)|
| 3:10:15| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| Do you have a question, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| Yes, my question I think deals with the same thing Commissioner McKenzie is asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11419)|
| 3:10:26| We're looking at three separate databases of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11426)|
| 3:10:32| We're looking at the number of votes cast in a particular race that seated someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11432)|
| 3:10:39| We're looking at the number of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11439)|
| 3:10:46| And of these three databases, I think the question is if we change from one database to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:58| if we use gubernatorial votes and we change to votes received in an election by that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:08| Mr. Law Director, is that changing this from the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11468)|
| 3:11:16| Let me be clear on what the Commission is trying to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| In its present form, as it's before you, it does refer to the gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| Now, the goal is to at this point go forward and eliminate that requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| Is that my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11492)|
| 3:11:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11493)|
| 3:11:34| You're saying use the database of record for the votes cast for that office at the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:42| He's saying if you change it from using gubernatorial to using votes cast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11502)|
| 3:11:46| is that a sustainable change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| And, therefore, we'd have to go back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| I believe if you're going to, if that's the case, if that's your intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:56| to go from that which is currently written now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| Which is gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11519)|
| 3:12:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| And let's ask Commissioner Briggs if we were moving to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| No, I think what, I may have misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| I think that what Commissioner Leuthold is trying to do is we want to split the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11529)|
| 3:12:13| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| And I'm talking about the first part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| What will be the database of record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11536)|
| 3:12:18| Well, the first part of the question, though, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| deals with everything except what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| And just as soon as we accept everything except the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11543)|
| 3:12:29| then all we'll have to do is deal with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| But what we're voting on now is just to split the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| and agree that we agree on all of the rest of it but the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11554)|
| 3:12:38| and then we can come back and get to what you're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| I smile now because I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11561)|
| 3:12:49| You wanted to talk on the numbers, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| Well, my statement also addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| Give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| My name is Barbara Nicodemus, 4016 Sam Cooper Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| I would like to thank the Commission for allowing me to speak on behalf of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11581)|
| 3:13:10| I wanted to speak before any vote because our statement also addresses other parts of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11590)|
| 3:13:21| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11601)|
| 3:13:22| I am the second vice president of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:28| At the request of our president, Jamie Dobbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| I am here this afternoon representing 176 local members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11610)|
| 3:13:35| to share our position regarding revisions to the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11615)|
| 3:13:39| and in particular addressing the process of recalling an elected official from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11619)|
| 3:13:45| The League of Women Voters supports actions to simplify the election process that are fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11625)|
| 3:13:53| The League is in agreement with all proposed revisions except the revision that would require signatures on the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11633)|
| 3:14:01| to recall an elected official to be 25 percent of votes casted in the last guberatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11641)|
| 3:14:08| It is our understanding that this revision could require over 30,000 votes on a countywide petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:17| We believe that the cost and effort in acquiring this many signatures places an undue burden on individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11657)|
| 3:14:25| trying to obtain a petition to require a recall election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| The citizens of Knoxville deserve a recall process that is fair and not too cumbersome, yet one that cannot be abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11669)|
| 3:14:37| If there is just cause to remove an official, we want this decision to be in the hands of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11677)|
| 3:14:43| Therefore, we urge the County Commission to carefully reconsider your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| on the number of required signatures on the petition for a recall election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11688)|
| 3:14:53| Several proposals have been discussed at the County Commission meeting that would better reach this middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11693)|
| 3:14:59| After much consideration, the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11699)|
| 3:15:04| is in support of requiring the number of signatures to be 50 percent of the votes cast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11704)|
| 3:15:10| in the election of the official being considered for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| The League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County appreciate your consideration on this important matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11713)|
| 3:15:20| and trust that you will put the principles of fairness and balance in the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:26| when making your decision on the recall issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| Barbara, before you get away, you mentioned in your comments just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11735)|
| 3:15:40| That is not mentioned in the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| I think it was in the former ordinance or the current ordinance in place, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| Dr. Briggs may be able to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| I don't know if it was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| I think it was because one of the blanks that was in there says that so and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11755)|
| 3:16:00| that blank office holder will be recalled for blank reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11760)|
| 3:16:05| And part of the reason we took that out is you don't have to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11765)|
| 3:16:11| first of all, you've got to define just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| And then this is what I understand just cause to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11773)|
| 3:16:17| because if it's something that's for a criminal event, then that's handled in the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| and not handled by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| The voters can recall a person for whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11783)|
| 3:16:28| You can't list everything in there what's part of just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| And that's why I think the voters should be able to recall someone for whatever they want to recall them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11791)|
| 3:16:36| They don't have to give a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| Because when a person actually votes, he may vote for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| They don't want that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| It could be for moral reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| It could be for ethical reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| It could be, you know, for a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| He's irresponsible, but it's not illegal to be irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| And that's why we took that out specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| because it was in the original ordinance saying he's being recalled for blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| And, you know, that gets up to a lot of what we consider immoral behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11817)|
| 3:17:02| That's very, you know, relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11822)|
| 3:17:05| And that's why we took that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11825)|
| 3:17:06| You should be able to recall an official for whatever reason you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11826)|
| 3:17:11| Yeah, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| And the main issue is to place it in the hands of the voters to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11833)|
| 3:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11840)|
| 3:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| So we have a motion on the floor to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| I think we had more citizens that wanted to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:30| No, I don't have any names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| You don't have Bill Phillips' name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| Oh, I thought he wanted to talk on. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| Does he want to talk on what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| or do you want to talk on the number of votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11861)|
| 3:17:46| Come on down, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11866)|
| 3:17:50| I think Greg McKay wanted to say something, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11870)|
| 3:18:02| Thank you, Chair and Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| My name is Bill Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11885)|
| 3:18:06| I reside at 8100 Wood Road, Coryton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:12| And what I'd like to do is just share a little bit of information with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11892)|
| 3:18:16| It's been a great privilege and honor to serve the citizens of the 8th District on the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11896)|
| 3:18:23| Unfortunately, even though that I was properly elected to this position over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:27| my family and I have been subject to a concerted effort, mean-spirited campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:33| to deframe my character, embarrass me publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| and to intimidate and harass my family and other family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11917)|
| 3:18:43| The effort to have me removed from office through a recall petition failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| as the people of the 8th District did not support that recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11927)|
| 3:18:54| The strain placed on me and my family have been enormous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11934)|
| 3:18:59| Attacked on the Internet, attacked in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| and even aggressively confronted in person when simply trying to live our daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11941)|
| 3:19:10| I am not a politician, and these dirty political tricks have surprised me and saddened me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11950)|
| 3:19:17| I sincerely hope that this is not politics as usual in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:25| My goal here has been to improve the quality and effectiveness of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:31| and apparently others have quite a different goals and agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| and there's no qualms about who they may be hurting in pursuing these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11976)|
| 3:19:42| What I'd like to do is just take a little bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| and share my personal situation with the commissioners before you make this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:55| In the year 2008 nationwide, we've had groups and it's time for us to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=11995)|
| 3:20:04| but we've had groups come up and tell you that recall efforts are not going to be used as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12004)|
| 3:20:14| to redo elections, and I have some very startling numbers to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12014)|
| 3:20:23| In 2008, is there any commissioner here who can tell me how many recall efforts there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:28| in the United States in 2008?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12028)|
| 3:20:32| Nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12032)|
| 3:20:36| There were 11 recall efforts in 2008 nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12036)|
| 3:20:42| In 2009, would anyone like to take a guess on how many recall efforts there were in the year 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12042)|
| 3:20:53| 160 nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12053)|
| 3:20:59| 2010, we're in the first month of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| There's approximately 200 recall efforts active in the United States currently for the year 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:09| and we're in the very first month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12069)|
| 3:21:13| Personally speaking, this recall has damaged my community, my family, my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12073)|
| 3:21:36| I have always, for a number of years, I have always tried to be in a leadership position in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12096)|
| 3:21:47| Whether it be with rescue efforts during 9-11, whether it be with rescue efforts during Hurricane Katrina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:55| I was able to come together with the mayor's office, the sheriff's office, sometimes KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12115)|
| 3:22:01| the county commission, the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| We would come together as a community and get things done and get things accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12123)|
| 3:22:10| I've kept my head down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| I've kept it in the sand, and I hunkered down through this whole recall petition dealing with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:19| This is not going to be good for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:24| This is not going to be good for anything other than to pit one organization against another organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12144)|
| 3:22:34| I can tell you right now, I can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12154)|
| 3:22:38| There have been a total of 67 articles written locally about my recall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12158)|
| 3:22:47| I can go back, and you can go back, and you can do the research yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| You can see where at the beginning of the recall, signatures are not going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:57| We're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| We're going to change this, and we're going to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| The only thing the recall has done in our demographics, it has put stress and strain not only on my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12184)|
| 3:23:17| and myself and friends, but it's put the same thing on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12197)|
| 3:23:23| That's not what we're about here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12203)|
| 3:23:29| I was wrong for not resigning immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12209)|
| 3:23:35| I understand that, and I think there are some people here who will appreciate why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12215)|
| 3:23:46| But when you talk about political recall efforts, and you see you go from 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12226)|
| 3:23:52| you have 11 nationwide to 160 a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12232)|
| 3:23:59| And we're talking about, you know, when you say just cause, you say for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:07| It's taking on a life of its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12247)|
| 3:24:10| It's taking on a fad, and it's not good for communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12250)|
| 3:24:18| And if there's any questions or if I can answer any of the Commissioner's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12258)|
| 3:24:25| I'll be more than happy to take questions and answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12265)|
| 3:24:31| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| Yeah, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12277)|
| 3:24:38| You know, I tell you, I have a lot of sympathy for everything that you and your family has gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:43| I believe that you were elected in an uncontested election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12283)|
| 3:24:46| But I tell you, when you run against opponents, you know, it may not be a recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12286)|
| 3:24:49| but when an election comes around, basically every election is a recall on any incumbent official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12289)|
| 3:24:56| Three points I'd like to make, though, that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| and I wish none of that stuff would happen either during a recall period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| I wish people could keep elections clean also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| But the same thing happens when you're running because, really, a recall is just an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12305)|
| 3:25:09| Three points I would like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| I know some people have said that people from outside the county will look at what goes on in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| and if we have a lot of recalls, which I don't think we're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12317)|
| 3:25:20| but if there are, that would reflect poorly and make it difficult to recruit business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12320)|
| 3:25:26| I think it reflects more poorly when someone's looking to come into Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| and they say that if there's an official that they really want to remove, they have no mechanisms of removing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12330)|
| 3:25:36| I think that reflects more poorly on our county and our government to say we don't have a mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12336)|
| 3:25:41| Secondly, there's really a three-part process, and, really, the recall is not the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12341)|
| 3:25:46| but it's being removed from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| You know, one, the petition group has to get together to put forth a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12348)|
| 3:25:54| That's one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12354)|
| 3:25:55| The second step is they have to collect the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12355)|
| 3:25:58| That's step two, and that's the difficult part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| And then even more difficult, they have to persuade enough of the voters that you, I don't mean you yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12361)|
| 3:26:07| but that the elected official did something so egregious that he deserves to be removed from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:13| And, of course, that person, particularly with the recall ordinance that we're putting forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12373)|
| 3:26:19| we have such a long period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12379)|
| 3:26:20| We have a two-year period from the time the person enters office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:24| until he's even eligible to be put on the ballot for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12384)|
| 3:26:27| You have plenty of opportunity to show that you're a competent official and that you shouldn't be recalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12387)|
| 3:26:33| So we really have a three-step process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| and I think the important number is not how many recall petitions have been started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:42| but how many have been successful in removing the person from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12402)|
| 3:26:48| Can I respond back to Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:51| I have that information available for you at any time that you'd like to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:54| Let me go to your first point that she was talking about relocating businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12414)|
| 3:27:03| I will say that Davidson County, Shelby County, Hamilton County, and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12423)|
| 3:27:08| all four of the major counties in the state of Tennessee, are having issues with recall elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12428)|
| 3:27:15| And that's the name that they've given these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12435)|
| 3:27:21| It's not recall petitions, recall drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| It's recall elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| That's the nickname for a recall now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| The information that I have gathered, it will show that maybe it will not happen here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12449)|
| 3:27:40| Maybe we won't never have another recall petition after these resolve themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12460)|
| 3:27:49| But if I was a business owner, and I was a business owner in Knox County for a number of years, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12469)|
| 3:27:58| we've had somewhat of a confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| We've had some problems with the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12482)|
| 3:28:07| We're making it entirely too complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| I believe that's what elections are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| If you don't like the job that the individual is doing to begin with, you don't vote for that individual again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12492)|
| 3:28:23| That's the way that you solve the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| You let this country operate the way that it has for hundreds of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| That's why we have elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12513)|
| 3:28:36| But we've created another tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| And if you lower the numbers, we've created a tool that each side, it doesn't matter what side, red, blue, it doesn't matter which side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12519)|
| 3:28:51| You're going to be able to use that tool somehow to influence this body to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12531)|
| 3:29:02| Because when you're under a threat of recall, everything changes in your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12542)|
| 3:29:08| And I can speak to that because I was just subject to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12548)|
| 3:29:14| And I don't want to see this county, I don't want to see the recall group Bill Phillips committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12554)|
| 3:29:20| I don't want to see nothing other than all of us as a county try to come together and try to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12560)|
| 3:29:31| So at this time, I'd like to announce that I'm resigning from the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12571)|
| 3:29:40| Effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:54| Do you still have a question, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12594)|
| 3:29:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| Maybe I misunderstood Commissioner Briggs, but I thought he said it's important for us to have a mechanism for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12598)|
| 3:30:06| I thought we had one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12606)|
| 3:30:08| Well, no, we don't have because, see, there's a technical problem with it is you're answering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| you can't answer two questions with one yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| You're talking about right what we've got before this commission now, but there's always been a way to recall people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12616)|
| 3:30:22| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| Not really not under our old county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12624)|
| 3:30:28| We didn't have it until when was it, November of last year, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| But let me tell you something about business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| I managed a large business and then business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| Now, here's one thing that I'm going to disagree with Commissioner Briggs on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| If I was in charge of a corporation and I was coming in here to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:49| the first people you want to talk to would be your mayor, possibly the finance chair, intergovernmental, and some commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12649)|
| 3:30:58| And you come in here and all of a sudden there's one or two up for a recall, where does that leave you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12658)|
| 3:31:05| It scares you to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12665)|
| 3:31:08| Now, we've got a mechanism and we're lowering it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12668)|
| 3:31:12| And I don't think we need to make it too easy because I'm just like Mr. Phillips here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12672)|
| 3:31:17| I think that a lot of people will use this if they don't like the way you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12677)|
| 3:31:22| Now, it's possible, it's very possible for some of these recalls, you get recalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12682)|
| 3:31:29| and it takes a smaller amount of number of the people to recall you than was voted against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12689)|
| 3:31:36| So we don't need to make this too easy in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| I think it can hurt Knox County if it's too easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12699)|
| 3:31:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12707)|
| 3:31:48| I was prepared to speak while former school board member Bill Phillips was in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12708)|
| 3:31:56| But since he's left, I'll make my comments to him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| One thing, as I mentioned last month and also at the forum, that we've got to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12726)|
| 3:32:13| we're talking about votes that it takes or signatures that it takes just to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12733)|
| 3:32:20| If it's 1,566 or whatever number comes up to get it on the ballot, that 1,566 votes does not recall that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12740)|
| 3:32:30| We haven't set that number yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12750)|
| 3:32:32| This only gets it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| And that's the thing I think we need to keep in mind on setting that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12754)|
| 3:32:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| I've said a lot on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| I'm really passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| All I want is good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12768)|
| 3:32:52| All I want is good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12772)|
| 3:32:54| I want Knox County, when I leave this office, I want to leave Knox County a better place than I found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12774)|
| 3:33:07| Prior to my getting elected, this commission was very unresponsive to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12787)|
| 3:33:14| When the wheel tax was passed, we had hundreds of people out here begging the commission at that time not to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12794)|
| 3:33:23| And we were ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12803)|
| 3:33:26| And that may have started some of this turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12806)|
| 3:33:29| But right now, the pendulum has swung too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12809)|
| 3:33:32| And I know, Mr. Brown, you say, well, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12812)|
| 3:33:35| That puts it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| It forces a person to run twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12817)|
| 3:33:40| And you may be a wealthier man than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:42| And you may have wealthier friends than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| And it may be easy for you to raise money for a second election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12824)|
| 3:33:49| But it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| It's hard for somebody that isn't that well connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12831)|
| 3:33:56| I wasn't that well connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| And maybe I don't belong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12838)|
| 3:33:59| I'm sure a lot of you all, you know, I know you look down at me and I know I get a little too passionate at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12839)|
| 3:34:07| But I got out and I worked my tail off to get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12847)|
| 3:34:12| And honestly, I should just throw my hands up, vote with it, and lower the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12852)|
| 3:34:19| Because in a few months, I'm probably going to be one of these folks out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12859)|
| 3:34:26| And if you give me a valuable tool like this to where I can threaten with recall over 1,500, 1,200, 1,800 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12866)|
| 3:34:35| that empowers an activist and that empowers the wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12875)|
| 3:34:43| Because, yes, the wealthy, as it stands now, can reach the threshold because they can hire the people to get the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12883)|
| 3:34:54| That's the way life is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12894)|
| 3:34:55| You make it easy and the wealthy can use recall on a whim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12895)|
| 3:35:01| If it's easy because if it's easy it will be cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12901)|
| 3:35:05| An activist can use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| It's not good for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| It was bad before when you didn't listen to us over the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12910)|
| 3:35:15| And it's bad now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12915)|
| 3:35:16| There needs to be some balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12916)|
| 3:35:18| And, Mr. Briggs, I know you're a very wealthy man and running a second election would not mean a thing to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12918)|
| 3:35:28| but it would to me and I'm sure it would to a lot of folks sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12928)|
| 3:35:32| and I'm sure it would to a lot of people who would like to run for one of these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12932)|
| 3:35:36| Now, we just saw a man resign who did nothing wrong while he was in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12936)|
| 3:35:41| He had some personal problems that were taken care of that had nothing to do with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12941)|
| 3:35:47| Yet, because people had something against him, and I can't imagine why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12947)|
| 3:35:52| the man has done nothing but written checks for charities throughout his lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12952)|
| 3:35:57| He is one of the pillars of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12957)|
| 3:36:00| He is exactly the kind of person, despite what happened on one night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12960)|
| 3:36:07| in a state of frustration after his mother passed away, they got past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12967)|
| 3:36:15| And nobody knows the story of what happened unless you're a friend of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12975)|
| 3:36:18| But he had one problem one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| He quickly got right back on path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| He has been a faithful school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| He has always showed up to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| He has always voted his conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12987)|
| 3:36:30| And all he has done is given to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12990)|
| 3:36:33| And now the stress that this stuff has put on his life caused a man who is the kind of man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=12993)|
| 3:36:40| that probably should hold office because of the way he lives his life most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13000)|
| 3:36:45| not the way he lived his life on one very stressful night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| He should be the kind of man that holds office, but he just threw his hands up and left today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13009)|
| 3:36:56| And I'm afraid that if we make this easy, and I think it should be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| There are times when people should be removed from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| But if we make this easy, then it's going to happen all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13023)|
| 3:37:07| and we're going to run a lot of good people out of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| and we're going to have a lot of good people that will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| I'm not even going to run because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| And you're going to have a lot of people that are going to give in to threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| When a wealthy developer says, if you don't vote for my zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| I'm going to hire me some UT students and run a recall drive against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13042)|
| 3:37:26| And when a neighborhood association says, if you vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| we're going to get out and get signatures and force you to recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13050)|
| 3:37:35| If you lower the threshold, it's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| I'm a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| I was a politician before I ever got here, and I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13061)|
| 3:37:46| If you lower this threshold, I may well use this at some point to get someone to vote my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13066)|
| 3:37:53| Commissioner, I need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13073)|
| 3:38:01| Let's just make it a reasonable threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13081)|
| 3:38:06| Let's not make it too easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13086)|
| 3:38:08| I want to leave Knox County a better place than I found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13088)|
| 3:38:11| I want to leave Knox County responsive to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13091)|
| 3:38:16| but not so responsive that three or four people can sway something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13102)|
| 3:38:24| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13104)|
| 3:38:25| All I want to say is I'm not running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13105)|
| 3:38:28| It's not going to affect me anyway, the recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| but I just don't think it's good for Knox County to make this too easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13111)|
| 3:38:35| because it will be used against someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13115)|
| 3:38:39| Because every time you make a vote up here, you vote some way that someone doesn't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13119)|
| 3:38:45| And we just don't need to make it too easy for Knox County to be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13125)|
| 3:38:50| because we're going to lose good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13130)|
| 3:38:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13134)|
| 3:38:55| I just want to point out two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| One is that both of the present recall petitions that are out there have failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13137)|
| 3:39:02| so those weren't successful petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| The second thing, I know people think that we're making it too easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13145)|
| 3:39:09| The one that was originally proposed, you know, the 50% of the people in election, that's twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13149)|
| 3:39:14| That's twice what other states have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13154)|
| 3:39:17| There's 40 states that have recall provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| So, you know, if somebody's looking for some place to go and do business that doesn't have recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13160)|
| 3:39:24| they're going to have to look pretty hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| They're going to have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| I'm not even sure Alaska does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| I've got a list of all the states here that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| But, yeah, Alaska does have that, and they're 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13172)|
| 3:39:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13175)|
| 3:39:36| But the level that we set originally, and this was just a working number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13176)|
| 3:39:40| and I agree with what Lumpy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13180)|
| 3:39:42| I agree with what Paul Pinkston said and everyone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| I don't intend to make this easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| We don't want to make it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| But we have to have a mechanism of doing it when we have people that the citizens want removed from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13189)|
| 3:39:55| And like I said, if you're just talking about having a recall provision in your charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13195)|
| 3:40:01| or in your state constitution, 40 states, I think it's 41 states, already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13201)|
| 3:40:06| And, again, the number that we're talking about is twice the threshold that the majority of those states have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13206)|
| 3:40:16| And I know we've gone off on a tangent here because we really shouldn't be talking about the numbers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13216)|
| 3:40:21| What I'd like to do is get back to Commissioner Lutho's original proposal and vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13221)|
| 3:40:25| and then we can go to talking about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| And I'm not advocating a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| I'm advocating, first of all, that we fix the technical problems in the present recall ordinance that's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13229)|
| 3:40:38| And then after I think we clear the motion that Commissioner Lutho has on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13238)|
| 3:40:44| then we can talk about the numbers because I'm not interested in making it easy to obtain either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13244)|
| 3:40:52| I, too, would like to get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13252)|
| 3:40:54| Commissioner Burroughs, we do have a motion on the floor to split the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13254)|
| 3:41:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13261)|
| 3:41:02| I've heard concern for Bill Phillips, and I've heard concern for elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13262)|
| 3:41:13| and I have yet to hear anybody mention any concern about the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13273)|
| 3:41:18| And that's who this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13278)|
| 3:41:19| So I would ask everyone to please keep all relevant parties in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13279)|
| 3:41:25| I'm not interested in making this too easy either, but it does need to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13285)|
| 3:41:32| Commissioner Hyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| I want to go ahead and vote on Commissioner Lutho's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:37| But I want to ask Greg, do you all have any questions or comments about not the number but the other part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13297)|
| 3:41:43| Are you okay with the other part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| And the number is a separate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13308)|
| 3:41:50| This came up, as Dr. Briggs mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13310)|
| 3:41:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| I'm Greg McKay, the Administrator of Elections, Room 218 in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13313)|
| 3:41:57| This came up because there were some flaws that needed to be remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13317)|
| 3:42:01| Scribner's error called it 705 instead of 805, and in the new ordinance that's been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13321)|
| 3:42:08| The problem of the question, the wording of the question, and that's been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13328)|
| 3:42:14| There's also in Section 2, Number F, the question about the tie that we discussed at the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13334)|
| 3:42:20| The way it's written now, if there was a tie, then I don't know what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13340)|
| 3:42:24| We'd fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13344)|
| 3:42:26| We'd fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| That's part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13347)|
| 3:42:28| We'd fix that while you were gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13348)|
| 3:42:29| You took out the first sentence, I believe, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| Commissioner Briggs, isn't that what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| We actually did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| I think Joe had given me a corrected copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13354)|
| 3:42:37| but the one that's actually in the agenda that we can click to today still has that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13357)|
| 3:42:42| But we've taken that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13362)|
| 3:42:43| That's why I wanted it, because I got that copied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| We've taken that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13366)|
| 3:42:47| That needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13367)|
| 3:42:48| One concern I have sitting here, and, you know, I'm not able to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13368)|
| 3:42:54| Maybe the law director can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13374)|
| 3:42:56| Can you pass part of this thing today and then pass another part of it with two readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13376)|
| 3:43:01| Are we not going to have two questions on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13384)|
| 3:43:05| Can you pass part and then have a second reading and then two more second readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13385)|
| 3:43:10| I mean, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13390)|
| 3:43:12| In just a few minutes, we'll talk about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13392)|
| 3:43:15| No, but I think it's points to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13395)|
| 3:43:18| The question is, if we can only come to a consensus on this part of the question today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13398)|
| 3:43:24| we would have one question on the ballot come August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13404)|
| 3:43:28| If we can't come to a consensus on the numbers, I guess we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13408)|
| 3:43:33| You've passed the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13413)|
| 3:43:34| We've passed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13414)|
| 3:43:35| That would go before the voters, and the numbers would remain at 15% of all registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13415)|
| 3:43:41| because that is already in the original part of the charter, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13421)|
| 3:43:46| Well, I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13426)|
| 3:43:48| It's a question you need to think about, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13428)|
| 3:43:51| Now, the question is, is if we come back and approve a different number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13431)|
| 3:43:57| other than what's currently in the charter, then can we adopt that so that it's one ballot question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13437)|
| 3:44:06| Well, let's give an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13446)|
| 3:44:07| Mr. Jarrett, what's the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13447)|
| 3:44:10| If we split the question, do we have two separate on the ballot, two separate issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13450)|
| 3:44:17| Well, the issue as to whether or not there should be a recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| you distinguish from the criterion for the recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13462)|
| 3:44:25| but the supervisor of elections would be the one to actually articulate the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13465)|
| 3:44:30| and normally he would do that in conjunction with the State Elections Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13470)|
| 3:44:33| So does that – let's say the ordinance before you, Mr. McKay, let's say it was approved as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13473)|
| 3:44:41| Would that be able to be crafted into a singular question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13481)|
| 3:44:49| Well, if you approve it as written, yeah, that wouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13489)|
| 3:44:54| So the distinction is if the commission approves part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| and then ultimately approves the second part, which is merely changing the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13497)|
| 3:45:02| that would still be the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13502)|
| 3:45:04| except for the fact that perhaps they're doing a substantial change that may require them to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13504)|
| 3:45:08| That's the concern, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13508)|
| 3:45:10| If it's a substantial change, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| Because then you have one that you pick today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| and then you have one that has a first reading today and a second reading next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13515)|
| 3:45:19| And keep in mind, we do have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| If it gets to be April or so and this has not been all put together, then we may have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13521)|
| 3:45:27| But you've got a month or two or three to get this worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13527)|
| 3:45:32| But for continuity purposes, obviously the simplest, cleanest methodology would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13532)|
| 3:45:37| one concise reading of all the changing criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13537)|
| 3:45:41| that which amends the current state and likewise provides for a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13541)|
| 3:45:47| The question, though, is we approve this part of it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13547)|
| 3:45:54| even if we do not come back to enough votes, let's say a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13554)|
| 3:46:01| which we have to have 13 since it's an ordinance to change the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13561)|
| 3:46:06| If we can't come up with 13 votes on the number of signatures, we still have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13566)|
| 3:46:13| You have to approve both parts and both parts have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13573)|
| 3:46:19| Just because, let's say we approve this, the part that I made a motion on, but we can't approve the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13579)|
| 3:46:26| Now, we can either, in order for that to even be, we still have to come back and approve it overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13586)|
| 3:46:36| We can't just approve part of it and not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13596)|
| 3:46:39| Now, we can approve it and then we can, that's just to take part of it off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13599)|
| 3:46:43| so we don't have to discuss it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13603)|
| 3:46:45| And then we can just get into what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13605)|
| 3:46:48| So, in dividing the question, you're approving part of it, you're approving the other part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13608)|
| 3:46:53| and then you come back to the original question, which is to approve all of it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13613)|
| 3:46:59| Sort of like when we do the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| We approve a different item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| We may make a motion to approve the budget with these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13623)|
| 3:47:07| and then we may have these friendly amendments where we come back and vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| but then ultimately we have to still come back and vote on the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13629)|
| 3:47:13| That's sort of the way I'm looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| We approve this part of it, we approve another part of it, then you still have to come back and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13635)|
| 3:47:20| Here it is, one vote, one concise vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13640)|
| 3:47:23| You still have to come back to your original motion that this is the way we amended it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13643)|
| 3:47:28| and now it's a final up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13648)|
| 3:47:32| But you still could do it as two different questions on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13652)|
| 3:47:37| because there's a possibility that we might only be able to come up with change in this first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13657)|
| 3:47:42| and we can't come up with 13 votes for any particular way to come up with the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13662)|
| 3:47:49| And then the question is, do we want to change at least this part come August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13669)|
| 3:47:56| This changes it in its entirety, according to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13676)|
| 3:47:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13679)|
| 3:48:00| You don't get to pick and choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13682)|
| 3:48:04| And the problem I have with the way it's written now, of course, is the gubernatorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13684)|
| 3:48:07| and the doctor mentioned that we simply cannot use the gubernatorial election numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13687)|
| 3:48:12| to separate out the school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| It's just impossible because of the secret ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| I think everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13697)|
| 3:48:18| If I need to explain it further, I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13698)|
| 3:48:21| But it's because of split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| Some of the people who go in to vote at Gresham vote in the second school board district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13703)|
| 3:48:27| and some vote in the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| And while we certainly can tell how many of them vote in the school board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13709)|
| 3:48:32| we can't tell how many from the second part of that district vote in the governor's race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13712)|
| 3:48:37| and how many from the seventh vote in the governor's race because of the secret ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| But that part would not be a part of approving the changes so that we don't have a two-question problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13722)|
| 3:48:49| I mean, right now, we theoretically can't do a recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13729)|
| 3:48:52| because the process would require two questions on one ballot, and you've said that that's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13732)|
| 3:49:01| Well, the state, when this came up before, they just eliminated that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13741)|
| 3:49:08| You know, if part of this ordinance doesn't follow state law, then that part can be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13748)|
| 3:49:16| So that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13756)|
| 3:49:20| Maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13760)|
| 3:49:21| Maybe I'm looking at this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13761)|
| 3:49:22| But I think it's a whole parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| You're either voting for the whole thing or you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13765)|
| 3:49:27| You can't change part of the recall petition because it says it changes it in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13767)|
| 3:49:33| Now, as far as how you structure your votes today, that's up to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| as long as you come out of here with a package that we understand what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13776)|
| 3:49:40| And the package could just be simply if we can't come with a consensus of the number of petition signers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13780)|
| 3:49:51| then we could still restructure to get rid of the problems, the technical problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13791)|
| 3:49:57| Is that not correct, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13799)|
| 3:50:00| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13800)|
| 3:50:01| I think we ought to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13802)|
| 3:50:03| I think that what we ought to do is, I mean, we're splitting it, but not as a question to put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13803)|
| 3:50:09| but to agree that we're going to agree on everything except the numbers to get that behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13809)|
| 3:50:14| And then I think ultimately what we need to do is, you know, I just believe in keeping everything simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13814)|
| 3:50:20| You know, let's don't make this too complicated or we won't even understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| But I think ultimately that what we need to do is to come up with the final result being one, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13825)|
| 3:50:32| one thing that we're voting on in two readings that goes on the ballot is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13832)|
| 3:50:37| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13837)|
| 3:50:38| And I think that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13838)|
| 3:50:39| And rather than this being really the second reading of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13839)|
| 3:50:42| let's just agree that we're not going to discuss this other part anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13842)|
| 3:50:45| which so far there hasn't been much discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| And then let's use our time that we're going to allot to this to talk about the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13848)|
| 3:50:55| That's why I wanted to split the question so we could take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13855)|
| 3:50:59| Get this off the table, and then let's just talk about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13859)|
| 3:51:01| It looks like we're talking about numbers anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| I mean, if we can't agree with the numbers, then we didn't come back to, I guess, the answer to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13863)|
| 3:51:08| is if we can't agree on a number, we don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13868)|
| 3:51:11| I guess we can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| Because, like I said, we have to come back and approve it as one entire entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13873)|
| 3:51:19| This part and the numbers part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13879)|
| 3:51:21| I think if we absolutely can't agree on the number, what we need to do is to correct things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13881)|
| 3:51:26| And then if we have to, just leave the number where it's at, even though, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13886)|
| 3:51:31| there may or may not be many of us that agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| Because I really think what we need to do is to correct the problems in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13893)|
| 3:51:38| I mean, that's the whole purpose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13898)|
| 3:51:39| And the secondary purpose is to see if we wanted to re-look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13899)|
| 3:51:44| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13904)|
| 3:51:47| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13909)|
| 3:51:50| And you all, I'm clear on what you all are wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13910)|
| 3:51:54| Hopefully other folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13914)|
| 3:51:56| You know, I guess in terms of, no, I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13916)|
| 3:52:01| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13921)|
| 3:52:03| There's not a lot of split precincts out there, relatively speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13923)|
| 3:52:09| Can we, say, take the conservative approach and say we'll take Gresham, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13929)|
| 3:52:18| between the 2nd and the 7th, if there was a way for us to say, okay, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13938)|
| 3:52:22| if 100 people voted at Gresham, we'll put all of those numbers in the 2nd and the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13942)|
| 3:52:29| That way you still have a number that we can base it off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13949)|
| 3:52:33| Again, like I said, we're not talking about a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| It would increase the numbers that the people would have to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13955)|
| 3:52:39| But I think it would make it cleaner in terms of what, you know, we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13959)|
| 3:52:47| If we go off of, you know, some of these other ones, I think we're going to end up making your life miserable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13967)|
| 3:52:53| I think the gubernatorial races, it's, you know, widely contested most times, at least every eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13973)|
| 3:53:00| You know, they get good numbers of people that get active in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13980)|
| 3:53:03| So I like the gubernatorial race number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| But if there's a couple of split precincts, is there a way we could just apply those to both districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13986)|
| 3:53:13| Well, you know, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13993)|
| 3:53:16| I think every school board has a split except for the 8th, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=13996)|
| 3:53:22| So it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14002)|
| 3:53:24| And I'd like to put you all on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14004)|
| 3:53:26| About how many districts are we talking about that have splits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14006)|
| 3:53:29| Eight out of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| Oh, eight out of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14011)|
| 3:53:32| I mean, but at least one, or do some have multiple splits within their district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14012)|
| 3:53:36| I think they all just have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14016)|
| 3:53:37| I could be wrong about that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| No, that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14019)|
| 3:53:40| Sam, I have a couple of ideas, but I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14022)|
| 3:53:43| Wait until we get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14023)|
| 3:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14024)|
| 3:53:45| So then I guess, thank you, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14025)|
| 3:53:48| My question, and this is, I guess, to Deputy Director Jarrett, is I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14028)|
| 3:54:00| I would hate for us to do something today that creates lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14040)|
| 3:54:04| That's what I don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14044)|
| 3:54:05| I mean, hopefully we can come out of today or next month, whichever way we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14045)|
| 3:54:10| with an ironclad, defendable recall process, and there's not any holes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14050)|
| 3:54:16| So, you know, I know we kind of put you on the spot as to whether, if we split this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14056)|
| 3:54:21| whether it requires two separate ballot initiatives and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14061)|
| 3:54:25| It will be good if we could get clear answers, because I don't want to vote on everything but the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14065)|
| 3:54:33| and then it turns around and bites us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| Someone comes up and says, well, no, you all actually voted on everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14075)|
| 3:54:39| and then you voted on the numbers, and then here we are in the middle of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14079)|
| 3:54:42| So I think what I heard Greg and Richard saying was that we're not going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14082)|
| 3:54:49| that we're going to just have a general discussion because we seem to be okay on everything about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14089)|
| 3:54:54| Well, what you have, sir, is you have a preexisting code section that has infirmities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14094)|
| 3:54:58| and what the supervised election will ultimately require is a singular document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14098)|
| 3:55:04| with a singular question that answers those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14104)|
| 3:55:07| If, for instance, you just vote on a portion of that, that merely takes that discussion out of the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14107)|
| 3:55:12| so you concentrate on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14112)|
| 3:55:14| You either adopt the numbers you have here presently before you or in the alternative a new set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14114)|
| 3:55:20| or you default back to that which currently exists in the charter, which is 15%, and it's broken out accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14120)|
| 3:55:26| But I think the idea will be ultimately a singular writing goes to the supervisor of elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14126)|
| 3:55:35| not two different ordinances, unless I'm misstating the intent of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14135)|
| 3:55:41| No, I think that's their intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| That is their intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14145)|
| 3:55:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14149)|
| 3:55:51| The thing that I wanted to try to get us back on to, I thought we had a split question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14151)|
| 3:55:55| but now I guess we really have a three-pronged question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| One is, do we want to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14159)|
| 3:56:02| Second is, what's the database?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14162)|
| 3:56:05| And third would be the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| And I spoke out of turn a moment ago when I said that's something we'll, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14167)|
| 3:56:11| if we can get by doing something, then we'll pick the numbers next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14171)|
| 3:56:17| So conceptually speaking, we've got three things in front of us right now that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14177)|
| 3:56:24| First would be, do we want to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14184)|
| 3:56:28| Second thing would be to pick a database or record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14188)|
| 3:56:32| Third would be to pick the percentage and melt that all into one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14192)|
| 3:56:38| and try to do it this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14198)|
| 3:56:42| The reason I asked the question a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14202)|
| 3:56:44| if we change from gubernatorial to registered voters, as the thing reads right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14204)|
| 3:56:52| would that make it then again a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14212)|
| 3:56:55| But to get us back lined up on what we've got in front of us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14215)|
| 3:57:00| we've got three questions and we need to fill in those three blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14220)|
| 3:57:03| Do we want to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14223)|
| 3:57:06| What's the database or record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14226)|
| 3:57:08| And what percentage do we want to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| And then we might be able to finish this particular item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14231)|
| 3:57:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14236)|
| 3:57:18| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| Mr. McKay, I kind of had my heart set on a number when we came in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14240)|
| 3:57:29| and we studied and talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14249)|
| 3:57:30| So you're telling me there's no legal, easy way to use the gubernatorial numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14250)|
| 3:57:36| Not for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14256)|
| 3:57:38| We can't ascertain those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| When we get down into using percentages of votes cast per office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14262)|
| 3:57:47| I mean, we saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| You know, if somebody doesn't have an opponent, they're going to have low numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14270)|
| 3:57:54| And when you look at District 1 and, you know, if we did the 50% or 51%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14274)|
| 3:58:04| you're looking at 1,254 versus 1,355.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14284)|
| 3:58:08| I'm sorry, 1,382 and 1,355.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| Those are relatively low numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14292)|
| 3:58:14| And that's what concerns me when you use votes cast per office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14294)|
| 3:58:18| when we're dealing with something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14298)|
| 3:58:20| You know, you're taking and using an uncontested race with voter apathy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14300)|
| 3:58:27| and you're essentially making that person run for a four-year term twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14307)|
| 3:58:33| two-year term twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14313)|
| 3:58:35| And, you know, I'm all for the citizens having the right to recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14315)|
| 3:58:40| But I don't want this to become our form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14320)|
| 3:58:43| I don't believe in a recall or a referendum form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| I think that's, when we get into percentages, I think that's what we're getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14325)|
| 3:58:48| And then, you know, if you're running for a four-year office and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14328)|
| 3:58:53| you set your, you know, you go in and start legislating and doing the things that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14333)|
| 3:59:00| you're going to make somebody mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| And it's going to be hard to get people to run for a four-year office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14342)|
| 3:59:06| when they have to run for it every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14346)|
| 3:59:08| And I think we need to be careful that we don't go into using percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14348)|
| 3:59:12| I think we need to be careful that we're not using uncontested races can be harmful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14352)|
| 3:59:21| whether it's candidate apathy or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14361)|
| 3:59:23| But it can be harmful when we get the numbers so low that you're just running another race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14363)|
| 3:59:30| And I think that's not what the intention of recall is, but that's what we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14370)|
| 3:59:36| That's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| I'd like to make a substitute motion that rather than voting on this as a second reading as part of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14382)|
| 3:59:48| that we vote on this just simply as an agreement that that will be what we'll deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14388)|
| 3:59:54| all aspects of this other than the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14394)|
| 3:59:57| And then let's just deal with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| And then once we get the numbers, and I'll leave this to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14399)|
| 4:00:03| but I think if we're going to change it from gubernatorial to some other mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14403)|
| 4:00:07| that will have to be a first reading, which we could do tonight if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14407)|
| 4:00:12| You wouldn't need to make that as a substitute in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14412)|
| 4:00:15| because if the law director decides that once we get into the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14415)|
| 4:00:19| he considers that a substantial change, that that would automatically happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14419)|
| 4:00:23| We can put that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14423)|
| 4:00:24| We don't have to, because if there is a substantial change, what we've already voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14424)|
| 4:00:30| say what I made the motion on, it automatically becomes a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14430)|
| 4:00:36| I guess what I'm saying is let's vote on this and then let's get to the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| I mean, you know, we're not even discussing what's on the table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14440)|
| 4:00:43| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| So did you make a motion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14445)|
| 4:00:48| Commissioner Briggs, did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14448)|
| 4:00:50| That motion's already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14450)|
| 4:00:52| I thought he had a substitute he was going to introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14452)|
| 4:00:55| But he said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14455)|
| 4:00:58| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14458)|
| 4:01:01| Brad, that's a really good point that you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| and we had discussed that in our committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14463)|
| 4:01:06| and had come up with the idea that we would set a percentage and a baseline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14466)|
| 4:01:12| whichever was highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=14472)|
