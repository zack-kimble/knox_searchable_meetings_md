| 0:01:50| Prior to the meeting, this was brought to my attention by Commissioner Smith, and I think this is on each of our minds tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=110)|
| 0:01:59| And that is the devastation and the loss experienced by our neighbors in southwest Kentucky and the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| So I would like to begin our meeting with a moment of silence for those who have lost their lives as well as so much in southwest Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=126)|

| 0:02:44| Then we will move to public forum. We have five individuals who have signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| And at the conclusion of that, we will get into the remainder of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=171)|

| 0:03:30| I'll read the non-consent items one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| They are item 1, items 4 through 9, 15, 18, 21, 35, 43, 44, and 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=214)|
| 0:03:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to see if we could add something to next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| Could we ask for an update from the trustee's office on the property tax bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| Absolutely. Without objection, we will add the update from the trustee at the front of next week's agenda during presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=250)|
| 0:04:22| Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Motion to set the agenda by Commissioner Smith, with a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Any discussion? All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| Any opposed? The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| Madam Clerk, would you please read item number 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Judge Jeffrey P. Emery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| upon his retirement as Judge of the Knox County General Sessions Court, Division II, Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| Move to approve with presentation next week, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I have a motion to move forward with our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Is there a reason why we don't just approve it this week instead of waiting until next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Or is it more of a formality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Well, it would put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| I've never wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| It would put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Oh, and then we wouldn't read it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Okay. Motion to move forward with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| I have a motion by Commissioner Jay and a second by Commissioner Ward to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| If it's all right with the sponsor, I'd like for it to be full commission if everybody else agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| I'll look to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| I think we're pretty unanimous in that one, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| We will note that the full commission is the sponsor of that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| All in favor of moving this forward, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| That moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| That recommendation will be presented next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| We have presentations, of course, will be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| We will now move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| We have five individuals who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| So as I call your name, if you'll please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| The podium is actually a couple of steps up onto the dais this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| First is Wayne Doster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| Is Officer Doster here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=375)|
| 0:06:24| What about Joshua Bowers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Officer Bowers, if you want to come down, we'll wait for Mr. Doster if he's still around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| Sir, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Before I get started, could I hand 11 copies of our pay scale out to the 11 commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| If you'll kind of let me know if you're commissioned or not, because I'll be honest, I don't know who all is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| I want to test that mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| We're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| All right, I'll just go ahead and get started while he's passing these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| My name is Bubba Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| I've worked at North County Sheriff's Office for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| I started the lowest ranking position in the entire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| I'm now the senior canine handler on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| I'm the senior patrolman on my shift, and I'm also a field training officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| I've passed every performance evaluation that I've ever taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| I'll let you know that as a patrolman, the pay scale, I'm a grade 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| I've been a grade 8 for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Since I give you guys all a copy of this, can any of you all tell me how much money I make a year by looking at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| Well, that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| There's no way to calculate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| I mean, there is on the steps, but it's not like, hey, this year you get a step, this year you get a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| It would take me almost 40 years to max out the patrolman steps at the rate that I'm at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| I make $42,000 a year, so I would be a grade 8, step 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| So it would take me almost, you know, I've got 15 years, I'm at step 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| You max out at 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| If I left today and went to the Pigeon Forge Police Department, starting out, no experience, I would get a $7,000 raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| If I worked the same career that I'm working right now, same amount of time, at Alcoa Police Department, I'd be making between $65,000 and $70,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| In one year at Lenoir City Police Department, I'd be making $6,000 more than I am here with 15 years of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| And I know you guys probably think I'm just cherry-picking the highest-paying departments, but I would start out at Merrill Police Department, no experience, making more than I make now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| One of my friends left here two years ago to go work at Oak Ridge City Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| He told me this year would be his second year of employment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| He's going to make $56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| In the last 12 months, the cost of living has increased 6.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| If you're single and looking to buy a house in Knox County, there are 37 houses for sale, $150,000 and below, which is the budget for a corrections or a patrolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=549)|
| 0:09:19| And I promise that that's limited, and the houses that are in that range, most of you guys wouldn't want to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| If you think there's more selection in the next price range, from $150,000 to $200,000, there's only 38 houses available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| If you attempted to live in this price range, you'd more likely struggle to buy groceries to stay financially afloat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| We can't afford to buy houses on our pay in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| How do you expect us to fill the almost 75 open positions in the jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| We have no way of projecting our pay over our career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| In the past 10 years, we have been doing just enough to keep up with cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| We're actually falling behind, and due to that, we're losing people in droves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Just this month, we lost three people off my shift alone on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| We can't train them fast enough to stay staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| And enough with the pay staffs, because it's common knowledge that we're underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| I'm going to take you down a different side of this that many won't speak of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| Since January, from January to September, I've responded to six shootings with nine different victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| I watched my partner shove his entire hand past his wrist into a man's body to pack his wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| And yes, the man survived the close-range shotgun blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| On another one, we frantically worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| On a chest wound, we got the patient conscious again, packed his wounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| and even carried on a conversation with him, and later he passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| It almost felt as if our efforts were wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| There are some that are much worse that I can't talk about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| But on January 24th, I was off work, received a call from my then-girlfriend that she was hiding in a stairwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Someone had shot at least two people at her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| responding from my house, and the situation will forever change several lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| The reason I'm saying this is because officers sometimes struggle mentally dealing with all these stressful calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| And as a patrolman, the only way that we can afford to live and pay our bills is by working side jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| So out of fear of losing the ability to work these side jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| they just deal with these on their own and limp through the mental strife that they have to put up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| If you're wondering why officers are dying within months of retirement, it's because of distress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| I spoke with dispatch a couple days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Last year, we received 590,000 calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| That's city, county, that's all 9-1-1 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| I couldn't get a breakdown other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| But that's 49,167 calls a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| We're up another 150 calls a month this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| And that's not counting anything past November 21st, which is a very, very busy time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| So it'll be up higher than that by the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| So we're running ourselves ragged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| We're grossly undercompensated for what we do, and the risk has got to be matched with reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| I'm not asking for you guys to give us a substantial pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| I'm warning you that we will not be able to continue to provide the service you're used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| if our salaries don't start matching some of these other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| We'll forever just be building a resume for others to seek employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| after we spend the money and time training them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Thank you, Officer Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=740)|

| 0:12:49| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| If you'll state your name and your county of residence, and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Wayne Doster, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| I'm 29 years old, and I've resided in Knox County my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Our goal here today is to inform you how low our pay is and to tell you our stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Mine is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I'm a God-fearing Christian, and I have been happily married for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| I have a four-year-old son and twin one-year-old boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| I started working at the sheriff's office in 2014 and worked two years in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| and made it to the road in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| I knew when I started this job that I was not going to get rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| I knew that there was not going to be a fancy car or a fancy house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I started the job for the same reason that I'm still here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| I was called by God to do this job, and I love to help people that are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| Our salary is not enough to provide for my three children, and that is where side jobs come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Side jobs provide us with little extra money at the expense of time with our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| Patrol officers usually have around 12 days off a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| and usually nine to ten of those days I am working a side job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| I only have about two days off a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| It wears on me knowing that I am missing my children who grow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| because I am having to work so much to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| My net pay this year will only be $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| I come to you today to beg you for a significant raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| that will keep our officers here at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| A small percent here and there is not enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| and we need a drastic jump to catch up with the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Per capita, we are the lowest-paid sheriff's office in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| while having the third largest population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| We are losing officers every month not to just higher-paying jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| but higher-paying departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| All surrounding counties are offering more officers more pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| to come work for them, KPD included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| We lost a good officer to Hamblin County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| because their pay for patrolmen is $52,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| I know of five officers right now that are leaving very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| They are five good officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| I know there is more because almost every officer I have spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| has looked for better-paying jobs, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| THP just raised their starting pay to the middle of $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Also, raising pay for current employees in a source from KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| stated they were doing the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| KPD has more call volume than us, but we answer more calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| because KPD has different policies handling low-priority calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| KPD received $3,000 in COVID bonus this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| We only received $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| KPD changed their response protocols during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| An example would be that during the height of pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| KPD did not respond to vehicle accidents with no injury due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| We worked every single accident that came in through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| While most people in the county were working from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| we were in the homes that were COVID-positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| working the death calls that were COVID-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| We were exposed more times than anyone else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| I know many officers on my shift that caught COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| from responding to such calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| We should have been compensated equally to the bonus that KPD received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| We do appreciate what we have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| but we desperately need a sizable pay increase that will help us retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and also attract quality officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| In a county the size of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| there's no reason that we should not have a cost of living raise every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| KPD gives their officers 2.5% on top of any other bonuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| and raises that they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And the chief of police does not have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| and beg the city council for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| The money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| There were thousands of houses built this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| that were not factored into the yearly budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| All those houses were a big surplus for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Where is that money going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| A salary increase for deputies could be funded from the new tax residue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| without raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| When you all call 911, we show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Regardless of race, ethnicity, age, gender, or sexual orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| we're shot at, we're spit on, we're fought with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| and we have people run away from us on foot and in vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| We work the most dangerous job in the world for $28,000 income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| We are pulled from our families on and off duty with side jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| and for almost all of us when it's time to clock out for our shift, we aren't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| We're constantly thinking of what we could have done better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| The abuse, the death, the sickness, the blood and the gore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1021)|

| 0:17:07| And we still have to work more to be able to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| More money would mean more time with family to decompress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| being able to go places and do things to take our minds off these awful things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| day in and day out, but with the pay now, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So we put our uniforms back on, we climb back in our cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and we go and work those side jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| I will close lastly with the most important part of this all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| As I said, we are losing officers left and right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1046)|

| 0:17:31| can offer us those incentives to stay and attract new officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| there won't be enough of us left to protect the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| If we continue to lose officers at this rate, everyone that stays will be overworked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| and the overworked officers will not be productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| and will look for other jobs to meet their family's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Officers who protect this county and citizens who reside in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| should not have to work their lives away just to support their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| The time to stand up and support us is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| so we continue to protect the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I challenge each of you to come do a ride-along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1077)|

| 0:18:04| Come and sit in my car. See why we deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| See what we do day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1087)|

| 0:18:21| Greg Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1101)|
| 0:18:35| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| If you will state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Okay. I'm Greg Mills, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| and I'd like to talk to you about Agenda Item 46 on this month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| And let me start my remarks by saying I have no opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| either good or bad, on the two firms mentioned in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| They have really nothing to do with my remarks one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| But my issue is what you're asking for seems to be incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| And what I mean by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| you need to start looking to make a public service announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| I don't know if you want to redo the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| or if you want to use another vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| but make a public service announcement to the public of what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| if there's like a cyber attack on the banking system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| You know, it's time to start getting ahead of all this nonsense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| instead of just reacting to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I don't know how many of you would have a plan for that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| but, you know, last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Pellissippi State got hit with a major cyber attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| You know, three months ago, it was a colonial pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| So I think you all need to start getting ahead of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| And like I said, I don't know if this contract is the best way to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| or if there's an independent mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| but I hope you'll consider, you know, making a PSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| letting us know what to do if all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| nobody can get to their bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| And anyway, because who knows what the federal government is going to do these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| They make things worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| But anyway, I just wanted to bring that to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| because I think you're still pretending like it's 2019 instead of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| And anyway, I hope you all have a Merry Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| whether you celebrate the holiday or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1218)|

| 0:20:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1224)|
| 0:20:38| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| You have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| My name is Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I'm president of the local Fraternal Order Police Lodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| I'd like to make you aware of the kind of competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| that hiring police officers, deputies, that it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| Recruiting nationwide has shrunk 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| That means it's a smaller pool to try to hire officers from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| because we don't just hire here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| We hire from the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| There's people as far away as Chicago and California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| that have come here to be police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Now, with that pool that's shrunk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| I'd also like to make you aware of what can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| if you don't adequately staff a police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Portland Police Department's only answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| priority one and priority two calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| They don't have enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| People have left the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| The early exit rate among the nation has tripled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| That means people are leaving police work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| They figure the money's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| So what agencies have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| they have to raise the pay to attract people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| If you go online, there's some of these departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| they've raised the rate $10,000 more than the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| There's at least a dozen departments now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| that offers a veteran that's got 12 years' experience $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| This area is competing with Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| just raised their rates 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| That makes it hard to get people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| We need to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Also, since Governor DeSantis made that order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| or made that statement, hey, come to Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| we'll pay you, we'll pay your moving expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| we'll support you down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Most of the counties in that state have followed suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| and raised rates trying to attract police officers to that state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| There's already been news stories where New York City police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| went to Florida because of Governor DeSantis' actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| in the counties down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| We don't need to fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| We're already short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| We have two departments in this county that are short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| We need to compete with these other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| because the end result is either be Portland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| or we can be like a lot of counties in Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| that are starting to see their staffing levels go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Unfortunately, it comes down to money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| We need to be competitive in this job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you, Mr. Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Is Mr. Stainback here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1389)|

| 0:23:22| If you will state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| You have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1406)|

| 0:23:36| It's time to share some facts about our current wages in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| our state, and our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| According to zipia.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| the national average for a patrol-equivalent officer is $53,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| or $25.93 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Currently, the starting salary for patrolmen at the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| is $39,000 annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| which is roughly a 36% decrease from the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| There are 95 counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| If it were up to me, I would stand up here and talk about all 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| But due to time, I'll refer to the top five by population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Knox County has the third largest population in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| and is exponentially growing every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| There are only two counties that are larger than Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| which are Davidson and Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Davidson County does not have a patrol division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| so I will refer to their Metro PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Their basic patrolmen are paid approximately $57,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| According to Intuit.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| a study of 239 tax returns was conducted in Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| revealing their officers to have an average pay of $60,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| I understand that these two counties are larger than ours, so I'll refer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1486)|
| 0:24:54| So I'd like to focus on the remaining two smaller counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Hamilton County has a population of 374,826,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| which is smaller than Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| The starting pay for patrol is $52,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| approximately 33.5% more than what my fellow officers are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| Rutherford County's officers' starting pay is approximately $44,000 to $48,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| The population is about 100,000 less than that of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| As of today, Knox County Sheriff's Office has initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| or received approximately 167,561 incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| To put that in perspective, that's approximately 33,512 per shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| 1,861 per patrolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| The job we do cannot be done without the officers that risk their lives every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| meaning that there are five patrol shifts at the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Not including supervisors, there's an average of 18 patrolmen per shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| There are 14 large zones in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| That means on any given day, four patrolmen can call out sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| have family affairs, or heal from an injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| I've seen approximately 10 officers resign in the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| All of those officers, very good officers, had one thing in common when they resigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1573)|
| 0:26:25| and that was pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Nothing is stopping the rest of us from leaving this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| for a more respectable pay either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| I myself get paid $1,132.59 every two weeks after taxes, insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| legal counsel dues, dental, life insurance, and retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| bringing a take-home pay of $29,447,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| which is unrealistic and just not sustainable income for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| Not to mention I have two beautiful children, child care is not cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and neither are the ever-growing prices that have risen since the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| the pandemic that not one single officer at the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| can dodge like most other professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| My partners did not stop when others did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| That being said, I make approximately $13.18 every time I get dispatched to a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| a call that could save someone's life or end my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I know I speak for every single man and woman at the Sheriff's Office when I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| we will take that call knowing the risks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| and I assure you the reward we do for it is not $13.18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| It's for you, our neighbors, and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I feel the worst is yet to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Over the past couple months, I've put in 13 full offers on a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| all of which I was outbid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Due to the ever-growing community, the small amount I am paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| and the housing market, I'm unable to buy a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| so my only way of providing a home for my family is a discounted courtesy officer's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| I stand before you not to ask to be average and not to ask for a small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| I'm asking to be above average because I believe our above-average community deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| I challenge every one of you to come on a ride along with me as well for a nine-and-a-half-hour shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| I will only ask one simple question at the end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and that's do you feel keeping Knoxville safe is worth $13.18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| And I really appreciate your guys' time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you, Officer Stainback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Is there anyone else to address commission during public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| Seeing none, the chair will recognize Vice Chairman Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you, Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1726)|
| 0:29:06| I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Officer Bauer said he was here, has worked here for about 15 years, grade 8, senior K-9, I think, in his pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1750)|
| 0:29:23| Is there any way you could just kind of like for the whole body and for us to go through the previous 15 years of his career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| and just kind of tell us the increases or the steps, how much a step is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| like kind of just show us the playing field of what they're trying to go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| like a little bit of a deep dive to kind of tell us a little bit more data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| Does that make sense, the question I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| 15 years is a long way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| I'm going to go back to say that we have the last few years put in an effort to raise salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1794)|
| 0:30:06| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| And so in doing so, going back to, let's just go back four fiscal years, so FY19 through FY22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1809)|
| 0:30:25| we would have raised salaries for officers by 5% in 19, 6% in 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1825)|
| 0:30:34| There was not a percent raise in 21 because of COVID, but there was a $1,500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| And then current year FY22, once the 1% raise goes in to affect January 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| it will be a 5% raise and two $750 bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| And so we have made a concerted effort to increase pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| The sheriff did come a few months ago and ask for a salary survey to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| and I think that's being done currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| And we await the results of that survey to see what we can do to implement to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| But that goes back four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| You could go back further if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| In 18, there was a 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| In 17, a 2% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| In FY16, a 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| And so that just gives you an example of things that we have tried to do over the past five to seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| to increase salaries specifically related to officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| Is there any way to get us the salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| to look at the salary for them whenever you get it as well so we can see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Or is that going to be like a presentation from the Sheriff's Office to Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| A survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Well, I think what will happen and what normally happens with a salary survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| they'll get their final results back of that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| We've done surveys in the past on county jobs, and so those results will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| The sheriff will, I'm sure, share them with the mayor and myself and Allison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| and we'll sit down and analyze those and see where they rank and what priorities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| and what needs to be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| A lot of times on salary surveys, some jobs you're paying high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| some jobs you're paying low, and there's some in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| And so you've just kind of got to look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| and you've got to look at what you're comparing to as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| and to make sure that it's more apples to apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| But once we get those results in, for sure, we'll share them with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| Thank you, Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Commissioner Hill and then Smith, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Mr. Caldwell, if you've not run off quite yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| I'm looking at this pay scale and step scale that was handed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| Who actually develops this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| We were handed a pay scale with the steps and different job rankings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| I can't see what you're looking at, but my assumption is that's the county pay scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| and that was developed a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| We've always had a grade and steps system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and how that works is based on your job duties, you're assigned a grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| and then in theory you get a step a year plus some sort of general increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| So if there is a 2% general increase this year for FY22, that whole pay scale adjusts by 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2027)|
| 0:33:57| And so the grade represents where your job is classified at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| and then the steps just ongoes as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| And then if someone gets a promotion, they're probably going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| They may go from a grade 15 to 17, and then so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| So this scale that I'm looking at, I know you said you couldn't see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| but it is the same for all Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| The Sheriff's Department is not singled out for a separate scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| No, I would say that's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Now, a fee office may choose to do it or may choose to use their own, so that's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| But as far as anyone that falls underneath the mayor or the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| they're on that pay scale, and fee offices, if they file a salary suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| can choose to follow that or can follow their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Okay. Is that the way most of our municipalities do that, with their law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| I think if you talk to the city, they're probably on what they call pay bands, which is very similar, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| You're going to have a min and a max, and you're going to be somewhere on that band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| And so that kind of gets you the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| It provides you an idea of what steps are, and those are a 1% increase per step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| It's a regressive 1%, but it's based on 1% from step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| So even the city is not sorted out as to if you are in a uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| you are on a different salary scale as opposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| I do think they're on pay bands, but your job would be graded out on a certain band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| and then that's where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| One thing that strikes me in looking at this is it looks like it goes to step 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| We probably don't have any Knox County Sheriff's officers that have gotten anywhere near the step 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2156)|
| 0:36:05| I'm just really trying to think out loud here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Would there be any wisdom to trying to sort perhaps the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2168)|
| 0:36:18| their scale out from other Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| perhaps condense these years of service down given the fact that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| I don't think that a step is equivalent to years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| Oh, so what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| So you could get an additional step or two for job performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| That happens, and so that's why it's not based off number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Oh, thank you. Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| I think, you know, if the sheriff wanted to look at a different pay structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| that's well on his right to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Now, what's going to come back is as we prepare a budget for FY23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| we're going to look to see what revenue increases have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| and he's going to be giving a salary range as far as so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| You're not going to see a huge swing in, like, salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| And keep in mind, too, one thing that hinders us as it relates to salaries is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| any time there's a salary increase above 3% that negatively impacts to what the county has to put into the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2251)|
| 0:37:41| And so anything above 3%, we have to put more into the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| It's a closed plan, but there's still 400 active officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| And so anything above 3% negatively impacts to what we have to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| And so there's a number of criteria that goes into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| And so as far as the structure goes, I mean, we can have conversations with the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| and change whatever he wants to change, but your salary budget and benefit budget is going to be what it is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2287)|
| 0:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Well, that's certainly not a decision, of course, I could even make a suggestion on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2297)|
| 0:38:26| but I'm wondering if that is something that might be worth talking about with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2306)|
| 0:38:36| He may have some other ways or suggestions about how to rework, actually, the money within his preview for his deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2316)|
| 0:38:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Just a possible suggestion to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Chris, Shelby, Davis, Hamilton, Sevier, Blount, Anderson, do they have their own retirement plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| Are they part of TCRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Do any of you all know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Probably smaller ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2354)|
| 0:39:32| And I believe that we have 250 current retired people receiving UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| And you just mentioned 400 current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Of those people that are in UOP, what does the county have to put in to maintain that retirement annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| What percentage of their salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| FY22 is about 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| So it's 35%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| So what does TCRS requirement of these counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| If you look at TCRS, it's about 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| It's 7% on the employee, give or take, and 9% on the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| And right now we're 6% on the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Keep in mind, too, that we also offer STAR, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| And so STAR we're putting in 12%, so we're putting in more than TCRS and the employees putting in 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| And the reason why I ask is it seems that a lot of our deputies are giving up a lot of current money for future money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| Has there ever been any talk of a buyout of UOP and a switch over to TCRS that could come with a raise in salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2433)|
| 0:40:45| We could look at a buyout of UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| I mean, it's up to each individual, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| I know I would not buyout of a DB plan myself, but if they wanted to, I mean, that's something to think about and we could talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| because ultimately it's future gains for the employer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| But currently under TCRS it would be 9% from the county and 6% from the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2473)|
| 0:41:22| I think 7% from the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| 7% from the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| And under the UOP it's 33% from the county and 6% from the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| And 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| I'm just wondering, I heard all these officers come up here and they were comparing to other cities around us and counties around us and how there's pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2502)|
| 0:41:53| What caused that big gap between Knox County and the rest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Is it because of the way we do their retirement or is it because we haven't really been putting, trying to fund it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2518)|
| 0:42:08| You know, it's hard to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| So that's really why I think it's important for us to get the salary survey back from the sheriff's office to see how we do compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| Give us maybe more of an apples to apples comparison, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Sometimes, you know, our size hurts us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| And so when we're bigger we have more employees, it hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| And so when you think about the city of Oak Ridge that has one high school, there's not as much money there going to education potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2552)|
| 0:42:46| So I think it's hard to get an apples to apples comparison until you look at it holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| And I think if you look at smaller places, they have a little bit of an advantage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| That's why I think, you know, let's see what that salary survey shows and see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Do you know, Mr. Caldwell, do you know, could you tell me, what the last four years, you were mentioning sheriff officer raises, what would be the normal county employees raises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2594)|
| 0:43:30| Yeah, so the last four years for the officers was 16% plus 3,000 in bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2610)|
| 0:43:42| General county employees received 9% and 1,250 in bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2622)|
| 0:43:52| And I asked this question last year, I don't know if you remember the conversation, it was a year ago almost when we do budget in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| But the sheriff's department last year had excess money of a million, two million, whatever it was in their budget that was already allocated towards them in theory for that fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2640)|
| 0:44:13| And the reason why that extra money was there was because we didn't fill those positions basically, so we didn't pay anybody for those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| Since the sheriff's department, or sheriff's office is his own elected office, if he chose to, could he restructure his office and how everybody is to create better incentives in theory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2661)|
| 0:44:36| It's a theoretical question more than a practical one maybe, but in theory is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah, so I think the sheriff's office did end with a surplus in their salary budget to end FY21 and it's trending that way in 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2681)|
| 0:44:53| So the sheriff along with Allison Rogers came and we had a conversation about could we use some of this money for a one-time bonus as a retention tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2693)|
| 0:45:06| We did that back in October, and so I think that's a mechanism that we can look to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| As you know, bonuses are not recurring, and so when you look at a budget, if we were going to raise salaries in the middle of a budget, then where are you taking it from, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2714)|
| 0:45:29| If you're increasing salaries and you take it from somewhere, so maybe it's vacant positions, I understand the sheriff doesn't want to give up vacant positions, but that's where it would come from, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2729)|
| 0:45:39| Ultimately, a one-time bonus doesn't come from a position, so it's easier to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| So I think conversations like that are fruitful and helpful, and I think that's why when he approached us and the mayor specifically back in the fall, the mayor wanted to help and we found a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2745)|
| 0:46:01| Just to clarify, that happened earlier this year is why we're getting these bonuses now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| What now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| This is what happened earlier this year where the sheriff came and said we want to give the guys a bonus, and we were able to give the guys a bonus because we had extra within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2770)|
| 0:46:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| I understand during the fiscal year, because this fiscal year is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| We've already approved the budget, what the salaries are, what the salaries are this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| We can talk about 2023, which starts September of 2022 for that fiscal year going forward, but not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| Yeah, I think this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| If revenues continue to progress at a positive rate and sales tax has been positive, keep in mind sales tax for the general fund is a small piece of that budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2795)|
| 0:46:48| So we're very heavily dependent on property taxes and the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| So we catch back up there and things continue to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| We're fortunate that we normally see about a percent and a half growth in property tax revenue year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2816)|
| 0:47:04| Sales tax growth has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Like I said, a lot of that doesn't go to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I think we could look at maybe doing another bonus if the sheriff wanted to in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| And so I think that's a way to try to get there from a retention standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Mr. Caldwell, you mentioned the salary survey several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| What is the timeline for completion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| That's a question for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| It was being done this fall and probably being finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| And so I haven't heard a time frame when that was supposed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2859)|
| 0:47:56| I imagine this is a salary survey that would obviously look at the market rates, look at the other agencies, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| look at the national average, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| It will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| And we should have that finalized hopefully by the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| We should have everything done because we are working on our budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| And just real quick, I think you can tell by the gentlemen, the men and women back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| they're very passionate about what they do, very passionate to be able to come up here in front of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| What I want to say, too, and, of course, we're going to have more discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| is we went back talking about the steps back several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| And, Chris, you'll have to remind me of when that salary survey was done under Mr. Rabinowitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| The county changed the way we used to do step raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Those step raises before were approved by people passing their merit system evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| And those steps back then were at a minimum of 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| So what they did with that pay scale was they put everybody in Knox County in that same pay scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| and it also reduced the amount of each step to almost 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| So they made more steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| They made like 60 steps now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Back then under the old system, there was about 12 steps at the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| which meant they could max out quicker and still get on each year any kind of whatever the county gave to all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2956)|
| 0:49:27| So that got reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| And I think that made a big difference as far as the steps through the merit system and the evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| So we've got a lot more to talk about later on, and it's coming as soon as we get everything put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| And as Chris said, any time that I can give our people a one-time bonus, I'm going to make sure it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| But here's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Every single individual within that agency will get that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| not just as some refer to as boots on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| because the support staff can't give that information to these men and women out here that are busting their butts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| that are out here being shot at, as one of them said, as being spit upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| and there's not another, not one other job that anybody else has to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| So I have to stand up here and defend those men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Been there, done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| And we want to work on making sure that we retain the people that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| And if there's any way that I can make that happen individually by bonuses or whatever it is, that's what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| Or either I need to get out of this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| So I want to make sure that we protect these men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| because they are doing things that the average person never will ever come across in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| And they take that home with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| So I'm off my high horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Sheriff, how many total employees do you have in the force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Total employees right now, about 955, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| And of those uniformed officers, as we would expect, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| sort of front line of the jail, front line of the streets is about 400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| With adding in corrections with that, you're probably looking at about 750, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| I would say that just as I hear the comments from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| as we talk about this in what will certainly be more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| these are different jobs than the regular Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| And I think to Commissioner Buster's question, it's a supply and demand issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, down 70-something percent in recruiting nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Supply goes down, demand goes up, prices go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Basic market economy, even with personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| And we've struggled with always chasing the how do we compete with what's around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| but we still have to compete with what's around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| So interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| I would caution us in sort of comparing the average Knox County employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| and what we do on a general basis range from what we do for our sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| It's a different job. It's a different experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| It's a different set of responsibilities. It's a different set of mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| And the budget season essentially starts in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| We will debate that in early May, late April, and put it into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| But obviously this will be a hot topic. So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Commissioner Smith, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had a follow-up question for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Tom, sorry to make you come back down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3167)|
| 0:52:58| And while you're coming, I want to thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| But I wanted to ask you about the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Is that going to be strictly pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| or is it going to be a combination of benefits and retirement comparison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| Right now it's just strictly pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| but I'm working on something separate with retirement and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| If I had been the mayor, he'd have been here twice as fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| I just got one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Sheriff Spangler was kind of going into a little bit about the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| between a step and a percentage, and kind of like when it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| I think, did you all close in 2012, I want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| 12 or 14. It was an even year, but I think it was 12, maybe 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| It was probably 14. It was 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3238)|

| 0:54:04| Well, can you give me just the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I wanted 15 because of Officer Bowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| but just 10 of the steps and percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| just so I can grasp my mind around everything, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| If you have it, if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| I believe in the last 10 years it's been approximately a 19% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| that's steps included, plus 4,200 in one-time bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| As you can see, a lot of that's been focused in the last four to five, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| Thank you, Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Commissioner Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| I just got one last question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| When you compare the TCR, the TCRS plan to the STARS plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| I know UOP is a whole different animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| and what's unfortunate is we have a lot of our older patrolmen that are on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| and then we try to hire in newer people with the STAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| How does the STAR compare to TCRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| We looked at a study of STAR versus the new hybrid TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| and over a period of 30 years, STAR is better than TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| Now, I think what the sheriff would say to you is from a retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| well, from a recruiting and retention standpoint, that can be hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| because you're trying to recruit an officer from another county who's invested in TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| or is vested in TCRS, and if they leave, then that goes away, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| Yeah, I mean, that can be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| And so, you know, maybe we need to talk to the state about MOUs between us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| and the state between TCRS and STAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| I mean, I think ultimately, you know, it makes recruitment more hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| I think the plan is really rich from the standpoint of what we did with STAR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| but I can see from a recruitment standpoint it can make it challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| I can, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3377)|

| 0:58:22| with appointing commissioners to serve on certain boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3502)|

| 0:58:39| Are there any commissioners that are interested in serving on the Metro Drug Coalition Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3519)|
| 0:58:50| This is not a chair designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| This is an appointment by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Commissioner Bick, do you have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3534)|

| 0:59:05| I had the pleasure of serving on it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3545)|

| 0:59:14| I would say it's not a board that requires heavy lifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| What they ask of their board members is a lot more strategy and support and advocacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3564)|

| 0:59:37| I would encourage any of our commissioners to serve on that, if nothing else, for a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3577)|

| 1:00:02| and its chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3602)|

| 1:01:14| but her term is not expiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| What is the pleasure of the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| I'd love to hear from the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| I think this will be my third year asking the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| What do we do with this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Why do we have this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| What's the purpose of this committee when we don't own, manage, operate, or have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| to do with the structure of the Arena Use Committee, even though the bonds were paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| off over 20 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| I've never gotten an explanation of why this exists very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| I haven't served on it, so maybe our current commissioners can help us better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| what it is so we can determine whether it's worth continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Mr. Schoonmaker, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| It's my understanding that originally when Thompson Bowling was set up, that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| in the original documents that there were designations that a certain number of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| commissioners had to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| And I'm not sure if that goes back to the two initial donors that gave money to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Well, it came because Knox County guaranteed part of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| We had a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| And it's basically a once-a-year meeting, and what they do is they preview for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| calendar year what events they've got scheduled, what improvements, what the direction of Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Bowling is going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| And so it's a very good informational thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| I've really enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I've been on it for four years now, maybe longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| I've kind of lost track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| But it's well worth the time invested just to know what's going on with a great resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| like that in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| And I think probably Commissioner Daly's taken away something from that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| And if I might, Mr. Chairman, just certainly open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| I agree that it's always good to have information about what's going on, but we don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| The rest of the commission doesn't get an update on what's going on once a year, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| So it's not like it's a community meeting or it's a legislative meeting where everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| We don't get a similar meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| We don't hold a seat on the board of any of the other venues in town, much less the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| venues of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| So I just, you know, why do we work on things that we have jurisdiction of and that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| purpose for and that we separate of things that happen in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| And so we have no management of this and we have no role in this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| The bonds were paid off after 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| And so we have no legislative seat anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Well, we still, you know, we're still every year contributing to the payments for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Knoxville Civic, the convention center, but yet we don't have a seat at the table there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3848)|
| 1:04:17| Perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| That's why it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| I'm like, the bonds are paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Why do we still work on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| But, I mean, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| I just, it's always baffled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| I just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner Daly, you sit on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| I do, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Just to follow up on Commissioner Spoonmaker's point, we sit there and I think we knew Garth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| Brook was coming to town, but we were told not to say anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| We were told a couple other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Beer sales was coming, but we were told not to say anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| So we can't give you updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| So, you know, it's their position to announce what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| I don't see it as a wasted committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| We looked at it as committees on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| It's very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Commissioner Durrett has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Unfortunately, we've been on Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| I've not got the full experience because it's been on Zoom, and I'd love to be back on it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| to get that full experience of, no, we don't need to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Yes, it's been very, very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Yes, you'll be like in, what's the other meeting, the chamber meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| You're told stuff that you don't need to be telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| We were told things here not to slip out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| It's very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Yeah, I wouldn't care to give you a report at the end of the year, but you're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| going to know it by that time because they're going to announce what they're doing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3955)|

| 1:06:01| I'm not sure it's up to us to decide if we have somebody at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| Isn't it their bylaws that require it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| So wouldn't that change have to come from them, not us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| I don't know the answer to that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=3974)|

| 1:08:09| I did get an answer from the Procurement Department within the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4089)|

| 1:08:29| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Is this also for the new facility that we allotted money for, for like a COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4117)|

| 1:08:50| Yeah, I was just going to make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| This was one where the next highest bid was several hundred thousand dollars higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| And this is a tried and true local Knox County company that's going to provide the services as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| That's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4143)|

| 1:09:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4148)|

| 1:09:13| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| On page 7, item number 35 is a resolution approving memorandum of understanding and agreement with Zoo Knoxville to provide $3,500,000 in coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds for activities that are related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4155)|
| 1:09:32| Funds for activities that aid in the mitigating of the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic readily funded through Treasury SLFR funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4172)|
| 1:09:47| Move to approve without any recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| I have a motion to send without recommendation by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Commissioner Jay, your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4202)|
| 1:10:17| Mr. Caldwell, could you help us better understand how this will affect the emergency loan that we passed in support of the zoo during the early days of the pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4217)|
| 1:10:28| So, this particular amount has nothing to do with the loan. It will come as revenue loss in that formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4228)|
| 1:10:38| This, basically, we are using ARP funds to pay off our capital campaign contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4238)|
| 1:10:49| It was like $6 million for $5, so we owed $3.5, so we're just paying that off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| So, the other loan, this will sort of take that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| No, the other loan is in revenue loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| Oh, so that's part of the bigger ARPA program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| So, like Visit Knoxville, we will forgive their shortfalls, but we'll do it through revenue loss, and that will come separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4272)|
| 1:11:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| The motion is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Lundy, with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| Any further discussion? All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Any opposed? That motion carries. Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| On page 8, item number 43, is a resolution approving a Knox County Naming Rights Gift Agreement to allow donors to make monetary donations to the Legacy Parks Foundation for the use and benefit of Knox County for the recreation facilities, park enhancements, and work development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4301)|
| 1:11:59| and to acquire naming rights to those facilities or parks subject to the approval of the Knox County Commission Resolution 703.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4319)|
| 1:12:10| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Move to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Motion is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Jay. Second is by Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Hill, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you. I had asked to have this pulled off consent because I had just some general questions, and let me start out by saying I have no objection to this per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4344)|
| 1:12:38| Dwight, do we currently have a naming policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| We do not. Dwight Mendevate, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville 37902. No, Commissioner, a good question. We currently do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| Past practice has been on a bit of an ad hoc basis, which we would like to get away from, and the use of naming rights as a potential source of support for park operations is part of a national model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4370)|
| 1:13:06| so we thought it was time to develop this framework and bring it for commission to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| And just, Mr. Chairman, if I might, the Gibbs Youth Sports Organization is having a fairly consequential meeting tonight, and Mr. Mack had to duck out, so I'm sorry to get the B-team, but he really needed to be there, so I told him I'm feeling as best I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4392)|
| 1:13:27| Thank you. I notice that this policy only covers, it appears, donations. If there is something given, be it land or money, some such, then if the process is followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4407)|
| 1:13:50| whatever it is, let's just say a park, then can be named after the person that donated the land or made a financial contribution. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4430)|
| 1:14:04| Yes, ma'am. That's what the policy provides for. Now, I don't think that that necessarily excludes, for instance, if commission wanted to act to name a public facility, a park or any other public facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4444)|
| 1:14:15| after somebody for meritorious civic service or something of that nature, it certainly doesn't preclude that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| It's just intended to give a framework if somebody wanted to make a generous donation in support of a particular field or facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| In exchange for naming rights, it puts a framework in place to let us do that and obviously use Legacy Parks as a third-party financial agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4470)|
| 1:14:40| What I would like to suggest, because I do think it's important that we have a framework, I'm wondering, and I kind of took some of my information from the naming rights policy that the University of Tennessee uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4480)|
| 1:15:01| They have a framework not only for a gift or a donation, but also including if they were to want to honor someone of some esteem that perhaps had never given any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4501)|
| 1:15:19| but the university or the government or whoever wanted to recognize that person because of their good works, per se, or reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4519)|
| 1:15:32| I'm just wondering, since we're already looking at this, if it might not be wise to incorporate that premise also in this policy so that it just covers overall a naming rights policy, regardless of if there's money or donations attached to it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4532)|
| 1:15:56| Yes, ma'am. We certainly wouldn't have any objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| At the pleasure of the commission, it might make sense for us to circle around with the law director's office to see if it's most appropriate to capture that in this resolution or maybe to capture it somewhere else, rules of the commission or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4559)|
| 1:16:14| But we'll do that this week and have an answer for you by next Monday, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| All right. And another thing I might suggest, too, the presented policy is, in my view, it's a little vague because this is a what-if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4579)|
| 1:16:35| Someone donates X dollars to build a park or whatever it is with the understanding that they'd like to have it named after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4595)|
| 1:16:49| And then Mr. Joe next door also steps up and says, oh, well, now, wait a minute. I've got a real interest in this. I might like to have my name on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4609)|
| 1:17:07| I mean, what do we do with those types of situations, if you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| I'm just kind of trying to think through. And, again, I do refer to the UT policy that's in place. They've been naming facilities and properties a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4634)|
| 1:17:30| I would encourage maybe to take a look at that and, again, pass to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| Yes, ma'am. We'll pull the UT policy, and then I'll confer with Mr. Boock this week, as well as to where, because, again, we'd have no objection to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| It'd still be commission's prerogative if, again, it was simply being done in recognition of somebody having done something meritorious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4666)|
| 1:17:55| As far as multiple donors, it's a problem I sincerely hope to have. So, we'll follow up with you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. I have Commissioner Daley, then Schoonmaker, and then Jay. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Hey, Dwight. Do you mind if I call you Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| No, sir. That's my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Are you director? What is your title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Dwight's fine, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Why are we going through Legacy Parks? And, if so, are they getting a percentage of handling? And how do we fund Legacy Parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4700)|
| 1:18:30| You know, as far as any kind of appropriation, that'd be a question for Mr. Caldwell. I actually don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4710)|
| 1:18:38| What I do know is that Legacy Parks is the primary entity that fundraises and acquires property inbound to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| So, the large inventory, additions of inventory we've had the last few years, and the large improvements we've had the last few years, have been as a consequence of the work that Legacy's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4724)|
| 1:18:56| Legacy, to my knowledge, is not charging any M&A money or any sort of fee for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| It simply provides a place other than finance for this deposit to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| And I think it's also based on the national model that Joe worked from when he researched and developed the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| For full disclosure, this policy looks a whole lot like the one in use by San Diego County, California, which is, I think, one of the models that he looked at when he did the research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4754)|
| 1:19:25| It'd be a good question for Joe on Monday, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| But, Legacy is our primary partner, and they are largely responsible for much of the acreage addition that we've benefited from over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| So, we're very comfortable with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| Mr. Chairman, Carson, Mr. Daley, I serve on the board. I'm happy to answer a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4779)|
| 1:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| You can defer to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| He's trying to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| So, I've got I.C. King Park, and I have somebody who wants to name a trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| We already own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| They still make the donation to Legacy Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Where will that money go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| You know, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| I think it comes back to park operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| But, again, that'd be a question for Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| But, I believe that money, ultimately, the framework provides that it comes back to parks operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4818)|
| 1:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Sorry to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| I serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| I'm happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| We just had this discussion at a recent board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Legacy Park serves as the fiscal agent, and it allows, as a 501c3 charitable organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| it allows a donor to receive a charitable donation for the contribution as the fiscal agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4839)|
| 1:20:47| It is a pass-through without a percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| and Knox County does fund Legacy Parks through designations every year as part of our non-profit list of places we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| But, it's purely a fiscal agent to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| For instance, Collier Preserve was donated by the family to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| They were able to get the tax deduction for the value of that land, and then that was passed on through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| Same thing with charitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| If you gave $10,000 to Legacy Parks for the naming of the Icy King Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| then they would hold it in escrow, and then they would release that and send that to parks when parks was ready to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| So, they can also hold funds and release it without a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| And, if I could just defer any further questions to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| We just had this discussion, so I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Mr. VanDeVate, do you know if Director Mack activated the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board and brought this issue to their attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| I do know that he's reinvigorated the Parks and Rec Advisory Board, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| In fact, they were in a session recently discussing the Parks Master Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| To the other portion of your question as to whether or not he consulted with them on this, that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| Okay, because about 15 years ago, Parks and Recreation came to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| and they had a proposal to install 160 to 190-foot cell towers in our Knox County parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| When the public found out about it, they contacted the Knox County Parks and Recreation Advisory Board and gave their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4944)|
| 1:22:33| and then the board, in essence, voted to not go forward with that project, and so Parks and Recreation withdrew that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4953)|
| 1:22:43| So, because, and at the time, the public felt that our parks are, you know, sacred and kind of a sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| and, you know, don't want to walk into Dunkin' Donuts Park or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| They just feel like it should be a Knox County park, and if you named it after a former mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| it should stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| So, I think the advisory board should make a recommendation before we take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| I'll consult with Joe, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| I don't know if he is involved with the advisory board in this discussion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| He has done a nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| It had been, quite frankly, somewhat neglected over the last couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| and it has been, Joe's been in the process of repopulating it, revitalizing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| and they've actually had a couple initial meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| But, again, I don't know if this has been a discussion topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| Your point is well taken, and certainly we would approach anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| circles the edges of commercializing the parks with a lot of suspicion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| I've seen some other proposals come through over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| One was for those big commercial ice machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| Struck us as a poor idea and a poor use of public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| We've seen a number of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Other than sort of the standard concessionaire relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| such as we might have at the Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| or somewhere where you might rent kayaks or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| we, I think, would be unlikely to bring a proposal like that before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| But I'll find out from Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| And, again, apologies, but we really needed him at the meeting out east tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| and so he will be here next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| But we'll circle back around to all these questions for next Monday's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| The answer to your question is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| we did talk about it at the advisory board meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| Did you take a vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| It was still an open discussion, and there were a lot more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| I have a lot more questions related to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| It seems like we have a resolution and we have an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| but we don't have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| And so I'll be happy to copy the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I have a lot of questions related to sort of the policy of that same sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| the commercialization of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| While balancing the public, the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| or the individual's interest in supporting our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| there's a fine balance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| I think the intention comes from not having the Dr. Pepper Park naming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| but more or less if you have a particular field that needs upgrading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| or things that you might get a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| but once you sort of open the door, it's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| Some of the questions I have is who would set the rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| Is a park as a whole cost more than a trail at Icy King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| Is a particular field at John Tarleton one price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| and is that price the same as if it's another field at Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| Who sets that rate and determines the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| Is it a naming in perpetuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| What happens if that field has to be replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| What happens if another donor comes after a certain period of time and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| I don't like the Richie Beeler Park, I want it to be the Justin Biggs Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| and so I'll give you more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| This is where policies come into place to be able to actually sort of regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| I'll send those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| I'm sure you may have more, but I also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| there's a little bit of the question of who can sponsor the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| It has to come to us for approval, but let's say we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| have a group that wants to sponsor a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| and maybe we don't think that's the best representation for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Who am I to say that that group is or that person is eligible or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| This is, it gets really muddy really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| I don't dislike the idea, but I think if we open the Pandora's box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| before we kind of set the policy in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| it might open up a lot more consternation for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| We couldn't agree more, and I had posed the question to Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| what if, thinking about Commissioner Schoonmaker's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| what if the adult bookstore on Lovell Road wants to sponsor a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| We're not interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| But if we have a framework that says you pay these funds and you're able to name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| do we have the authority to say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| Nationally, we think that's probably the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| but we'd certainly like to have clarity on that authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| both from this body and the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| And not to pick on you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| because I actually think Commissioner Bussler has one in his district too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| It's actually in Ms. Hill's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Ah, Ms. Hill's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| We're better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| We share these concerns, and I think this will be a pretty productive discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| but it does look to me like the chair's done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| No, the chair is open to whatever anyone would like to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you, Mr. Van de Veen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| The motion is by Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| with a second by Commissioner Biggs to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5267)|

| 1:27:49| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Item number 44 is a resolution approving a lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| with John H. Daniel Company for property located at 1803 North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| for a construction trades academy for a base term of five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| and the option to renew the lease for one additional year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| five-year term with an additional rental amount of $145,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| to be paid monthly in equal installments of $12,150 for lease years one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| and two with a 3% annual increase each year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| Motion to approve by Commissioner Smith, second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5317)|
| 1:28:48| I'm not sure who pulled this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| Oh, Commissioner Jay pulled this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Commissioner Schoonmaker, your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| I guess to begin with, I'm 100% behind what we want to use the building for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| My heartburn, I guess, is that we have a five-year agreement for lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| with a renewable another five years where we're going to spend $729,000 on rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| where this is not going to be a short-term school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| I hope this goes for the next 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| I know we've had some difficulties trying to find a building to place this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| In this case, I'm one of those where I think owning is better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| because then we can control the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| and what kind of improvements we want to make and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| When you get into that $750,000 range for five years that's just in rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5391)|
| 1:29:59| and I know the team has done a really good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| but I wish there was something still out there that we could actually buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| We do too, Commissioner, and when we set out on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| we tried so hard to find a site that we could buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| and we zeroed in on one in East Knox County that we thought was a really good fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| appraised out at $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| We authorized purchasing to take steps to start negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| and it sold out from under us for, I think from memory, $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| It's just, in a perfect world, we would love to buy a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| It's one of the reasons we kept the lease at five and five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| because we hope two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| We hope, one, we outgrow the space in the first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| That would be the ideal problem to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| And two, we hope that, you know, I don't want bad things to happen economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| but we would like a real estate market where it is possible to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| and buy sites for appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Also, as you know, with our process, if we set out to buy a piece of real property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| you're probably talking a best-case scenario of 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| if everything fell into line perfectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| and folks are buying stuff for cash in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| they're buying it above appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| and we were just so disadvantaged in the market that we ultimately ended up with the lease arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| We are still finalizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| We'll have the actual lease documents and the sublease for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| The sublease is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| We simply didn't attach it because the actual lease itself is not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| It's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Chris, Mr. Caldwell's got a couple little last-minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| and Mr. Sharble, a couple little last-minute negotiations going with the lessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| But we are super excited otherwise about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| ABC is bringing about a million dollars in state funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| in order to get the facility stood up for their use and purposes for facility renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| The landlord is actually putting in about $100,000 in improvements to get it ready for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| and so our cost is just to support the acquisition of the space for ABC to stand up the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5519)|
| 1:32:07| Clay Crownover from ABC is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| and if at some point in the meeting if we could give him a chance to speak to this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| He's also brought Mr. Roth, who's a local business owner who understands the landscape on the labor side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| and we would ask for them to have a few minutes if we might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| For the benefit of the folks who are watching this broadcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| do you mind just saying the square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| It's 16,120 square feet in change, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| It is on Central Avenue in the John H. Daniels Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| We like the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| It is centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| It is public transit accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| It will be ADA compliant upon our taking possession of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| and from both a geographic standpoint, from a public transit standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| and from a suitability standpoint, it's a really good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| We feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| It would have been too big for us to buy, candidly, had it been on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| but again, to your point, Commissioner Schoonmaker, in a perfect world, we'd have bought a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| and I hope someday we will, but it was not for a lack of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| If I could say anything to this commission, it was not for a lack of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| It's just a tough market, and again, with a four- to six-month process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| anything worth having has come and gone in the amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| From the time we're aware of it, it's sold before we could ever get serious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Commissioners, do you have questions for Mr. VandeVate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| or would you like the gentleman to come up and address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| I think we're at the beginning of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| I have questions about the Trades Academy in general, but that may be part of the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Commissioner Biggs, Commissioner Durrett, would you like to hear from these gentlemen first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| or would you like to ask questions first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| If this gentleman would like to come up to address the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| and perhaps the commissioners whose lights are on or others who have questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| If you'll state your name and address, sir, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| Jeff Roth, 9307 Daybreak Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| I came up here to talk to you a little bit about the Trades Academy and this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| but let me give you a little bit of background on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I'm in the commercial construction business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| I own a structural steel fabrication and erection company here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| I've been in business since 1966.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| I've also served on the board with associated builders and contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| and chaired that board back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| I'm a little older now, so it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| But what I wanted to do is come up and talk to you a little bit about the needs of our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| I primarily represent commercial trades, which involves a little bit of everything in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5682)|
| 1:34:51| I'm going to use some numbers that Clay gave me earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| Right now we're short 220,000 open positions in construction in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| That's a lot, and that's not including people who are getting ready to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| and our workforce is aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| We've got jobs available right now for kids coming out of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| They can go to work as electricians and plumbers and iron workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| Of course, those guys are near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| In our organization, you're looking at starting wage rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Field superintendents can make anywhere from $26,000 to $28,000 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5730)|

| 1:35:50| HVAC techs, $47,000 to $85,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| So we're talking about jobs that are very well-paid, very well-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| I'm also involved with our builder's exchange at Chariot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| and we have a CTEP program that we award money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| Knox County Schools have construction trade programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| And there's kids on waiting lists at Chariot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| There's 200 kids on a waiting list to take classes in the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| For so many years, kids have been told, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| if you don't go to a four-year college, you're a less than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| And that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| This particular program, I was talking with Commissioner Daley earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| this particular program we're talking about is a little different than, say, a TCAT, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| So if a kid graduates from high school and goes to TCAT, it's a two-year or four-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| That's a set-aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| This program, what ABC wants to do is kids coming out of high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| if he's interested in being an ironworker, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| they can call me up and say, I've got this kid interested in being an ironworker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Well, they may have a welding program in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| We don't know what the curriculum is specifically going to be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| But they would try to place these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| If a kid wants to work in HVAC, place them in a company that offers that kind of program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| that they can go to work in the field, and then they can take their classes at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| like 4 o'clock to 6 or something like that, a couple days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| So this program that we're talking about is a little different than other trades programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| if you think about it, that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| It's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| The other thing I kind of really want to stress is it is a lot of money for the county to invest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5853)|
| 1:37:44| but it's not a cost to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| It's an investment in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| It's an investment in the kids coming out of high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| that want to go to work in the trades, and they stay here, and they're productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| and they pay taxes, and they buy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| Not only that, they can get into this industry, and I tell these young people all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| the barriers to entry to owning your own construction company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| or one of these trades companies are not huge if you're so inclined to get in there and go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| and learn your industry and learn what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| There's a lot of people that go out and create their own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| There's people that have worked for me over the years in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| and gone out and started their own steel erection company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| So it's a very good opportunity for young people if they're so inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| And I'd just like to impress upon you how important this is and ask you to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5909)|
| 1:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| And I'm happy to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Thank you, Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Commissioner Biggs, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Mr. Roth, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| I'm really excited about this and the direction that it looks like everything is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| and I'm very passionate about trades as well, but I actually have a question for Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| A question for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Well, I'll get out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Mr. Vanderveet, you tackled one of them, and it was public transportation, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| But the second thing is I'm for this and this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| I think it's a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| But I've told constituents of ours that Knox County does not own anything that could suit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| So there's no Knox County buildings that we own that could suit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| So that is correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Ben Charbles here from property management, and we tried to explore all the reasonable options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| Particularly, it would seem like an old or surplus school would have been a good option, and it just wasn't out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| So we didn't feel like we had anything within the inventory of assets that Knox County owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| And when we went out to buy something, we were just unable to compete in this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| So that's how we ended up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Mr. Cranover can expand on this some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| but something I should have mentioned early on, too, about this is with regard to the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| I'd want this commission to recognize, and Mr. Roth touched on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| that it is complementary and not competitive with the other programs that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| I had a little bit of constituent feedback suggesting we're reinventing the wheel, and we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| We're just trying to make the wheel bigger because it's not big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| So, again, we are complementary to existing programs, whether they're at TCAT or the Schools Construction Trade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6022)|
| 1:40:31| Just demand exceeds supply, and so we want to help try to meet that demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| So that's how we ended up before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| And the order, I believe I have seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Commissioner Durrett is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Mr. VandeVeet, if you would so indulge me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| I, too, am looking forward to this program being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| But if I remember correctly, and please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| were we not in discussion with Knox County Schools on trying to implement this somehow into our current curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6062)|
| 1:41:10| or even starting a new curriculum and being able to have, say, maybe students go to school for the first half of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| and then the second half they could attend this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| Or is that something maybe we could consider in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| Potentially something we could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| ABC's program tends to focus on young adults because, again, they are already in the workforce typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| They work their day job and then come to skill up or train up in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| We have had a couple open-ended conversations, in particular on a couple of our site visits when we were trying to buy a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| and we had sites that were physically bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| Mr. Coatney from the schools was with us, and we talked about what our options might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| I don't know where they'll be in this particular location just because of size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| because some of the other locations we were looking at were 40,000 and 45,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| So that changed the conversation quite a bit from where we are currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| Let me just say that we are absolutely open to it, and if there's an opportunity there, we'll want to explore it and take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6128)|
| 1:42:17| Thank you. I think that would be a great way to even capture more students and get them into our trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| which, as was stated, is desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| I'm not sure if this is a question for you or if Mr. Crownover wanted to give an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| I just had a couple of programming questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| He's going to ask you to state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Yes, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Clay Crownover, 1729 Falcon Point Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| Can you talk about who can attend this academy, Trades Academy, what options they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6175)|
| 1:43:03| and then are there charges involved, age limits, students, adults, anyone that could be referred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| Help us understand the program as a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| So we currently in Nashville train around 435 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| A majority of those are member and so we're an associate of 501C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| That represents about 350 commercial construction firms between Nashville and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6205)|
| 1:43:33| Our school is made up of members and non-member students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| So we have about half of our school goes Monday, Wednesdays between 4 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6218)|
| 1:43:45| The other half goes Tuesday, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| They're only going twice a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Anyone can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| The cost in Nashville, we actually charge $2,400 in tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| And if you're a member of the association, you get a $400 discount per student down to the $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6236)|
| 1:44:04| We are not doing that in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| It's just a flat $2,000 whether you're a member or non-member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Anyone can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| An adult, a graduating high school senior, we classify that as self-pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| So anyone that wants to apply during our application periods and pay the $2,000 can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| They don't have to be employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| We do try our hardest to place people in jobs so that they can be working during the day and go at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6267)|
| 1:44:36| or have their employer actually pay the tuition for them, which is what a majority of the companies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| But anyone can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| And how long is the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| The program is four years, so it's about 154 class hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| We work in extra hours per year just in case we have issues like COVID where the school has to shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6288)|
| 1:44:56| and the students are able to meet the required amount of hours that they're supposed to have a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| But it takes four years to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| And is it $2,000 a year or $2,000 for the whole program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| It's $2,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| It's $2,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| So I want to learn welding, and I want to be a welder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| So I sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| It's going to take me four years to go through this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| But what you're saying is you might pair me up with Bob's Welding Company in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| even if I'm sweeping the floor, just to be inside the bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| Right, to get them employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| Because everybody's looking for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| And then I'm going to pay $2,000 a year to get my –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Or their employer will pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| Or the employer might support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| Or the employer also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Some of our companies actually will take the $2,000 out of the checks of their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| Will support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| And then after the four-year completion, they give it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| There's all kinds of different ways that they fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| And I want to make clear, too, that the school only runs – it's a basic school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| So it runs September to December, then there's a break, and then we go January to March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| So it's only about six to seven months is a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| That's a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| So it runs like typical high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| And then how long – what are the different trades that are offered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6368)|
| 1:46:16| So in Nashville we offer mechanical, plumbing, and electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| In Knoxville, we actually have – we have a master trainer certified by NCCER out of Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| that trains all of our instructors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| And she is certified to train instructors in welding, electrical, mechanical, drywall, and plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6392)|
| 1:46:42| I may have said that twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| We are going to offer – when we get in the high schools and talk to graduating seniors this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| we'll give them an option of which trade you want to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| In the next three months, when we go into those high schools, depending on what they pick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| we will then recruit instructors to teach those trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| But we will offer them a buffet going in of which trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| And we'll see – the good and bad news is that we have demand in every trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| but we have the ability to train in all those trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| It's – demand is high in them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| So if we fill up electrical, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| If we fill up mechanical, that's also great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Do you also have expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Let's say there's a high demand for masonry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| Can you add that at some point each year and continue to adapt to the needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| So basically the only thing we would need to do with that is hire a masonry instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| And we plan with the money we receive from the state when we build out the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| to include lab space that can be morphed into an electrical lab space, HVAC lab space, or masonry lab space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6468)|
| 1:47:57| And what if an attendee wants to – starts in welding and then goes halfway through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| you know, this isn't for me, I really want to switch over to plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Do they have to kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| It depends on what year they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| I see, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| I will have to get back to you on that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| Typically they don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| We will have dropouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| I mean, just like any school, we have dropouts, but we typically don't have switchovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| Just two more questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| How would you differentiate this from other trade schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| And we have other trade schools in the marketplace today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| So how would this complement and add to what's not already in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| Why would we start this new one instead of invest in something that's already here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| Well, I think ours is more because we have a direct connection to the contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| being an association made up of contractors, and we know the specific need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| So in being able to train those folks and have them working during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6535)|
| 1:49:03| ours is different than, like, say, a TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Or there are other programs that do what we do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| But we have that direct connection to the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| And the job placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| And the job placement is easy for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| And, you know, again, going back to what Jeff said, Jeff Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| we're around 200,000 short workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| And the current programs that we have, like, if somebody –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| again, it's not – we're not competing against each other because there's so much demand in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| And with the new infrastructure funding that may be coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| there was an article today saying there may not even be enough workers to fulfill that funding that we may be receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| So they're complementary to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| They're all different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| Everybody does it different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| But there's just not enough schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| My last question is, how will you measure success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| We're being asked to invest a significant amount of taxpayer funds into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| Of all the people, do you track how many people walk in the door, how many actually get job placements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| what the rates of their employment are and salaries afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| How do you track and measure this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| We usually, as long as they – our success in Nashville is based on they stay employed for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| and then they graduate fully trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| We do not track their salaries after they're out unless they're maybe a VA student that we train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6624)|
| 1:50:33| We do work with the VA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| But you're tracking out of 100 that come through the program, 85 percent graduate with a full-time job or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| There's some data and metrics that you can report back to us to say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| because, I mean, the question we will have after the first year is, is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| Are we helping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Are we spending the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| I mean, well, after five years, if we commit to this, how will we know if this is a good idea or a bad idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| And how will we measure reinvesting in a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| And you're looking at – you've got to think again at being a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| You're looking at 50 students, hoping 50 students that first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| And then as you go each year, you add another 50 freshmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| I'll call them freshmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| First year is what we call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| That's 100 students, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| So each year, hopefully, we'll double in size to where we get around – we're at the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| We currently train the 435, 425, 435 in Nashville with 14,000 square feet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| And we just built – we just bought a building in Nashville to expand that program to train up to 500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| So we do it based on how many kids are actually entering into the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| and whether or not we're growing each year and ready to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| To Dwight's point, we want to be able to grow it, and we also – dual enrollment is – we really –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6704)|
| 1:51:52| that's something down the road that we would like to partner with the school zone to get inside the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| I mean, that will only even help the school itself grow because those kids that are doing dual enrollment –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6717)|
| 1:52:06| I grew up in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Don't hold it against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| But we had tech schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| So you went to school half a day, and then the other half you went to tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| We don't have that in the state of Tennessee, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| So we would like to offer something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Well, I'm positive that the mayor's office and Dwight and his team will do a lot to track, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| what are the results of this so we can see if this investment is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| Thank you very much for the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Thanks for the patience, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| I'd like to go last, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| Without objection, we will move to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| I think you answered one of the questions about the fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| Because as soon as it doesn't have skin in the game, they're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| They're more likely to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| So they've got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| My question, I might have been dreaming the chief operating officer of Dwight Fannie Mae.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6776)|
| 1:53:04| I found your title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| You didn't think I'd find it, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| Was I dreaming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| I think last week I looked at the resolution and it stated that we would sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| and the $2,000 per student was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Was I dreaming or has the resolution been changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| There's two items before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| One is our lease with John H. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| That's actually the item that's on the floor at the moment is our lease with John H. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| And then the second resolution is a sublease from Knox County to ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| And that's where the program specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| And we included a few things like a minimum number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| We wanted to ensure that the program was appropriately populated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| because we are asking you to spend a good bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| Those items will be in a sublease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| And, again, you'll have both of those next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Did we pull $45,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| No one pulled $45,000, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| So that's where I've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Listening to all this stuff about the trade schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| some time ago I was trying to work with the schools here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| when I first got on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| And it was about liability because some of these jobs we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| we're talking these trades about welding, we're talking about plumbing, electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| These things have a high propensity to cause injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| In the schools we had it worked out with some of the private schools here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| that had those job training deals that they were working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| One is Temple Baptist Church had one of the best welding facilities here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| and a great trade school that the people that graduate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| have a job waiting for them when they come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| However, we couldn't get to deal with the schools because of the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| What I've been finding out, too, with this type of schools here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| is that I've been helping some young people get jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| to find out if they want to be in those trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| And I've got a couple with electricity and some in HVAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| and some other stuff that are working with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| You have to work with the company one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| and then the company pays for their tuition into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| Now there's where it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| If people last one year in that job and they feel like they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| they're not wasting their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| They can quit at any time if the job gets too hard for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| I think what we're doing here is when we're asking to pay some of the tuition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| and things like this when they first start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| you have too many people quitting and that's taxpayers' dollars we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| I think what we ought to do is basically get them a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| in the field that they want to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| and then let them work for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| and then the company will pay for their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| And I don't know how we can get that to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| It helps people that's already graduated from high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| that's 18, 19, 20 years old, just try to find themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| And I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| But I'm not sure that we go ahead and pay for something when they might even quit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| and then the money's already gone from the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| So the opportunity is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| I think the school is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| but they need to work in the field that they're in for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| before they decide to spend taxpayers' dollars on their tuition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| or their own private, whatever's in this field here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| And you'll find out we'll have more success at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Mr. Van de Veet, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| Just for clarification, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| we generally agree our investment, your investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| is in the space costs to make the facility available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| And then after that, the arrangement for tuition is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| as was outlined by Mr. Cranover, between the program and the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| So our dollars will be exclusive to space costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| and making sure the facility's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| And then after that, they'll administer the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| Thank you, Mr. Van de Veet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| Clay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| I think I understood you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Students will go two nights a week, roughly eight months a year for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| Is there any possibility of an accelerated schedule for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| Because I know a lot of people that go into the trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| and choose not to go to the four-year college route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| and a lot of their motivation is a desire to get involved in a career sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and not to attend school for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| I think that, considering we are not going to be having, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| we will have one office for the person that runs the school in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| and then the rest is just training facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| considering we won't have, like, offices like we have in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| the building likely will not be used until we do the dual enrollment up to 4 o'clock, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| So I don't think, I think that it is an option to provide a daytime option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7098)|
| 1:58:26| to have those folks that are not working to come and do it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| because otherwise the building is not getting used until 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Will this school qualify, or if the students qualify for Tennessee Promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| or Hope Scholarship money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| Because it is, Tennessee Promise, I think it has some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| I can't not get you a specific answer to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| but it's, I think there's some arrangement with, like, TCAT and those that get that kind of funny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| but we do not get that kind of funny at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| We are not scholarship eligible at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Is there something we'd like to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| Is it because you are, and if you said this, forgive me, are you private?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| No, we're a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| I mean, 501C6, we're just not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| And that's according to what the state's told you that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| That needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| On our agenda, things to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Commissioner Durrett, you are next, and then Commissioner Ward will have the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| I just have one more quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| You referenced that some employers may even pay the full tuition for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7188)|
| 1:59:54| What percentage of employers or companies actually do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| In Nashville, it's around 95% of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| We have less than maybe a dozen that actually pay for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| and don't work during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| Now, I believe this will be a little different starting out in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| It will be a little bit more us going into the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| and recruiting kids to enter into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| Commissioner Ward, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| More of a statement than a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| I serve on the Board of Directors for the Home Villagers Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| and I can't tell you how many times different owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| and different managers from different construction companies have come up to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| and asked me about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| If you ask the mayor, this is probably the number one thing I bug him about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| Every single time I see him, I ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| I'll even run into his office just randomly and ask him when it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| So I'm very excited for this to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| So I just want to convey my support in that, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| multiple businesses say they want to be involved and they want to work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| and I definitely think that part of the equation will be here in this market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| because there is a very high demand and high need for this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Thank you, Mr. Cranover and Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| Thank you, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| The motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| That will be on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| On page 10, item number 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| a resolution directing the Knox County Sheriff's Department Employees Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| to hire an attorney to represent them in all matters the council may deem necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| This is resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Durrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| with a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| I was looking at this and I was reading in the charter about hiring a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| Is this the 905?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| About hiring counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| It says in the charter that the law department is the one that hires the counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7341)|
| 2:02:30| And my question is where is the funding coming from to hire a counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7350)|
| 2:02:41| Director Caldwell, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| Mr. Chairman, I spoke with Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| He said that for the moment, since we're not in budget season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| as we discussed at the beginning of our meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| that this would come from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| And he said the money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| But who would hire the lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7389)|
| 2:03:16| Well, according to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| the merit counsel would have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| And I also read the charter, and it's Article 3, Section 3.08, Part D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| that states that no elected or appointed officer or employee of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| shall employ any other attorney to represent the county and or officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| board, or member of the commission unless he or she shall first be authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| and empowered to do so by resolution of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| which was the reason for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| However, the next sentence says, provided, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| that the law director shall have authority within the budget approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| the county commission for this purpose to hire outside counsel when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| in the judgment of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| such is necessary for the fulfillment of his or her duties under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| So that, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| makes it seem like it might come out of the law department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| But that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| Okay, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| There's no way that it would come out of the law director's budget unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| the law director authorized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| End of story on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| Secondly, you cited 3.08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| and you asked the question, Commissioner Busbee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| whether there was authority to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| And the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| That 3.08D says the commission can hire one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| but it only applies if there is no representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| I am the elected law director of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| elected by all of Knox County, not just one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| I took an oath to uphold the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| The Knox County charter governs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| It tells me that I have to advise and represent all commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| boards, councils, whatever, of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| Now, if the merit council were authorized to get another attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| that attorney would be in conflict with me because I would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| relieved of my duties under that charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| In this commission, the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| nobody has authority to relieve me of the duties that have been charged to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| by the voters of Knox County through the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| I am the only one that has authority to appoint outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| and in fact, as I said in the memo, I have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| I have done that in this case with two lawsuits going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| I've got an outside counsel, competent counsel, Melanie Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| competent 25 years as a government attorney to represent the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| I don't know where there's a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| It says that there is one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| I haven't heard of it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| I don't know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| It also says in here that our office has taken a position oppositional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7576)|
| 2:06:24| whatever that means, to the Knox County Merit System Council policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| and procedures, and in favor of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| I have no idea where that's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| That is totally an untrue statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| I'd like to know who said that and where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| Commissioner Durrett, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| The conflict, in my view, is that the sheriff is suing the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| and an employee who has filed a grievance against the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| The law department is representing both the plaintiff in this lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| being the sheriff, and the defendants, the merit system council and the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7627)|
| 2:07:14| To me, representing both the defendant and the plaintiff would be a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| even though it's not the same person, it is the same office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| That was when this was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| Since the resolution was filed, as Director Boock stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| an outside attorney has been hired for the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| Unfortunately, I did not find out until we received the memo from the law department on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| that that had been done, and even more so, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| I found out in the focus before we had received that memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| That is where this was coming from, is that the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| a lawyer from the law department was representing the plaintiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| and a lawyer from the law department was representing the defendant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| To me, that's a true conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| Law Director, I think he's got a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| Thank you, I didn't see his laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| My response to that is that no, we have not represented both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7706)|
| 2:08:32| Both sides have had their counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| You've got to understand with the merit system council on grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| they sit as a judge, a judge and a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| As such, both sides are entitled to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| Both sides are represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| The complaining employee, all of them are represented by very competent legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| The sheriff, likewise, is entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| This is like a lawsuit where an employee is suing the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| Both sides have the right to have legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| We represent the sheriff under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| We've got outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Well, number one, there's no outside counsel needed to represent the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| I mean, that's a fight between the individual and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| And then the merit counsel makes a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| Mr. Jennings, at the last meeting, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| look, all we do is sit here and listen to both sides and make an opinion, a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| But both sides are entitled to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| The sheriff's entitled just like the employee is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| and that's the setup that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| So I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| Additionally, I've got to say with this conflict of interest issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| government attorneys under the scope of the Board of Professional Responsibility under Item 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7790)|
| 2:10:01| says that government employees are not under the same rules as private attorneys in conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7801)|
| 2:10:09| The state has, and I will read you these so it will come not from my mouth but them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7809)|
| 2:10:16| One comes from Chancellor upstairs in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| He has ruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| This is the law in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| He said the Tennessee attorney general is not prohibited from representing governmental clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| whose interests may be adverse to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| The rule is that the attorney general, through his or her assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| may represent adverse state agencies in intergovernmental disputes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| He then says the Knox County law director is similarly situated to the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| in the Medicine Bird case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| Cites a code number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| It says Code 5.1.2.10 requires the Knox County Charter to assign the administrative functions of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| to the county officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| The Knox County Charter assigns the duty, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| to execute and administer all of the legal affairs of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| including litigation, to the county director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| That's in the county code, Part 1, Part 3, 3.08D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| This duty is not assignable in whole or in part to any other county officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| The Knox County Charter also states the law director is hired to hire outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| when in the judgment of the law director such is necessary for the fulfillment of his or her duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| I have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| It should also be noted, and this comes from the Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| had to do with Knox County itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| It should be noted that Knox County attorney represents the interest of Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| The county attorney is charged with conducting his or her advocacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| in what he or she thinks is in the best county interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| This may entail disagreement with individual county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| However, the fact that county officials may disagree with the county attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| does not itself create a conflict of interest for the county attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7933)|
| 2:12:18| March 30, 2001, case of Woodby Metropolitan, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| It was the Department of Law's duty under the Metropolitan Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| to furnish legal advice and representation in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| And in this matter, there was a board that disagreed with the metro government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| and there was a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| And they went on to say one attorney advised the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| while another attorney represented metro Nashville government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| There is nothing illegal or unethical about this arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| Further, I would point out that Sharon Bell, in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| in a lawsuit in which the Board of Education wanted to hire its own attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7977)|
| 2:13:05| outside counsel was retained by the county and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7985)|
| 2:13:12| A quarter million dollars later in fees that were paid to outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| $250,000, Sharon Bell said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| School board, you are not entitled to pick and choose in your own attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| The charter controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| The law director is the sole person that can make any decisions with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| So I leave that with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| And then we go next to what's impartiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| I don't want to get that's part of what the lawsuit, the two lawsuits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| And I'm not going to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| They speak for themselves, and I don't make any comments on lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| other than the pleadings, and you can read those pleadings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| and see what the allegations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| Thank you, Mr. Grook. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| I, along with Commissioner Bussler and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| we raised our right hand to follow the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| This resolution will go against the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| And what really scares me in this is the word all, A-double-L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| If for some reason this does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| and A-L-L means that, oh, they can hire lawyers for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| and we have no say so over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| We, as a county commission, it has no limit on how much money can be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| This is not a wise decision for the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| and the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| And I'm going to ask this hypothetical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| If this does pass, Mr. Law Director, and we go against the charter, we will be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8092)|
| 2:15:00| I'm going to say we will be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| I will not give up my duty to represent the Merritt Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| because they want other counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| And if you pass this and they can find some money to hire outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| there's going to be a conflict because I will not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| I will not under any circumstances give up my duty that I was sworn to do under the charter, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| So there probably would be, just like there was with the school board lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| Since the motion was for approval, this vote is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8132)|
| 2:15:38| If it passes, that means it goes on consent next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| But if it's voted down, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| And like I said, my personal opinion, it's going against the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| Because it's going against the charter, I'll vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Boots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| I had a question for Director Boots on, maybe you could help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| how did the Sheriff's Office get outside counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| If you could kind of refresh us to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| And how Mr. Prince is also, under what you were saying, he's a government attorney too, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| He falls within those qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| I kind of lost the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| I appointed outside counsel Mr. Prince for the sheriff in the Dooley lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8177)|
| 2:16:26| Did the sheriff ask for outside counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| I'm just trying to get to how he was entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| No, I was representing the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| And the issue came up, here's the way that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| You've got to understand, there's a lot of misinformation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| What started this was, is Ms. Dooley filed a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| did not follow all of the grievance procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| and simply filed this thing with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| And we gave an opinion that under the Fowler case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8213)|
| 2:17:01| the loss of a car was not a loss of salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| and that therefore this is nothing that the Merit Council could hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| It's its own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| We cited their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| At that time, Mr. Jennings, who was the chairman, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| oh, we have already decided that that is a loss of salary and therefore we can hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| What that told me was that the Merit Council felt they had the authority to tell the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| that they would have to foot the bill to supply a late model Chevy Impala| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8250)|
| 2:17:37| and a free gas car to Ms. Dooley to drive back and forth to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| At that point, I knew the sheriff had to have representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| and I reached out because Mr. Valiant said, oh, there's a big conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| Instead of fighting that battle at that time, I retained Mr. Prince to represent the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8271)|
| 2:17:59| The reason I ask that is I was listening to you speak earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| and you said something about the lady from Maryville being the government attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| Does that mean Mr. Prince is a government attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| No, I was just citing that the person that the lawyer that I had hired to represent the Merit Council was highly qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8291)|
| 2:18:19| and that I wasn't just sticking somebody in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| I got one of the most highly qualified attorneys out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| and hired them to represent the Merit Council in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| I was just wondering if that meant they had to be a government attorney and what those qualifications were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| Well, quite frankly, I think Mr. Prince had represented the sheriff, J.J. Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| and prior to that Sheriff Hutchison in many issues involving lawsuits and Merit Council issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8322)|
| 2:18:50| So he was highly qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| Thank you, Commissioner Riggs. Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| I just got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| How many lawsuits do we currently have against or involved in the Merit Council in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8338)|
| 2:19:07| There are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| There are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| And how many cases are they hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| Are they just hearing two cases or are they hearing multiple cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| I'm sorry. Say again. I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| Are they hearing two cases or multiple cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| Who the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| They've got four cases right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| Two of them are legitimately to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| They're not in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| The hearing procedure is not in violation of their own rules like the two that are now subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8366)|
| 2:19:32| So the two that, two of them are in violations of the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| therefore we're suing the Merit Council to stop them from hearing the cases, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| Well, it's not just suing the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| The sheriff who has a right to have an impartial hearing has sued in both those cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8384)|
| 2:19:53| sued the claimant, the employee that is claiming it and asking for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8393)|
| 2:19:59| and then the Merit Council is also a necessary party because they're under declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| Anybody that has an interest has to be in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| although the real guts of the action is the sheriff against the individual employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| So the sheriff's department, the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| is technically suing the Merit Council to not hear the two cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8419)|
| 2:20:24| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| They're suing on several issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| One is for a judgment saying, Judge, tell us what this rule says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8431)|
| 2:20:37| Is there authority for the Merit Council to hear this Dooley case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8437)|
| 2:20:42| because they're alleging that they're hearing this in violation of their own rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| Then also what has come up is a motion to recuse because of appearances of impropriety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8448)|
| 2:21:00| and the fact that one of the Merit Council members is running for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8460)|
| 2:21:07| and is therefore cannot serve on the Merit Council while she is running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8467)|
| 2:21:13| So those are two issues with regard to the rules and the facts that are before the judge right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8473)|
| 2:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| I kind of agree with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| I would have not chose to use the wording that was used in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| I agree that it's probably too broad and not restrictive enough, even if it was the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8495)|
| 2:21:44| I would like to know how much money we're spending on outside counsel, if you could, for next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| just in general with all these lawsuits that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| I don't like wasting taxpayer dollars, and this is a lot of money I feel like that's going out at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8512)|
| 2:21:58| I don't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| We don't have what we spent already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| Chris, if you could just, I would like to know how much we're spending on outside counsel at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8524)|
| 2:22:09| and what it kind of looks like going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| I don't need it this week, but for next week, just in case this goes to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| I'd like to know where we're at with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| So that's all I have for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Commissioner Biggs, just to go over what Commissioner Ward said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| So the Knox County Sheriff's Office has outside counsel under Mr. Prince,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8548)|
| 2:22:37| who Mr. Buca said we've retained before in the past, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| I haven't. He's been retained by prior sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| Oh, okay, under previous law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| No, previous sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| Okay, sorry, I'm just trying to summarize it all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8572)|
| 2:22:56| Well, the law directors, the previous law directors would have approved the hiring of Mr. Prince on behalf of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8576)|
| 2:23:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| That's the way it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| So the Knox County Sheriff's Office has outside legal counsel against the Knox County Mayor Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| and they're using an attorney that they've used previously, is basically where, to summarize things up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| is where we're at as of right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| I would be happy if everybody would waive this conflict issue in coming forward and doing what has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| and approved in the past and put up a Chinese wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| and our office would represent the sheriff, the merit counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| and then the individual employees would have their own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| I'd love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| However, there's so much misinformation, there's so many accusations, I didn't think I had any choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| But if everybody wants to waive that conflict thing, we'll be glad to not cost the county anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8629)|
| 2:23:57| Is there a reason why it wasn't the other way around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Is there a reason why it wasn't the other way around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| What do you mean the other way around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| Like, why did you decide to defend the merit counsel instead of defend the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8643)|
| 2:24:08| and hire outside counsel originally for the merit counsel instead of the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| I've lost you. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| So the sheriff is suing the merit counsel, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| For multiple different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| That's the two lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| I'm trying to understand why you decided not to represent the sheriff instead of representing the merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| So you have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| I could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| I could represent the merit counsel, but that's what they're hollering about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Because I gave them an opinion that they couldn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| That's why I'm asking that question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| I'm asking why did you not defend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| Because you make the final decision on who to hire for outside counsel, if outside counsel is needed or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| and you decided instead of hiring outside counsel for the merit counsel originally and representing the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| you decided to hire outside counsel for the sheriff and represent the merit counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| even though your conflict is originally with the merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| I'm confused by that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| I'm confused with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| I thought I explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| You've got the sheriff's entitled to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| Let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8708)|
| 2:25:09| I'm suing Commissioner Biggs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| And you're the one that gets to pick the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| But you disagree with Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| So you decide to represent Commissioner Biggs and hire outside counsel for me is basically what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8718)|
| 2:25:24| No, we've got to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| The lawsuit starts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| It's between the sheriff and the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| That's the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| The lawsuit is also to declare, because the sheriff says, number one, there's no impartiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8733)|
| 2:25:40| I'm entitled to an impartial justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| I'm also entitled to make sure that the rules as promulgated and as stated by the merit counsel are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8743)|
| 2:25:53| He says they're not being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| He's got a right to question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| And he questions that in the lawsuit involving the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| By definition, he has to bring the merit counsel in under the declaratory judgment act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| There's no choice in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| He's got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| But why didn't you represent him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Why don't I represent him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| They don't want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| I'll be glad to if that's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| I'm at a loss now because everybody says there's no conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| I'm trying to understand what went into the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| I'm trying to understand what went into your decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| Is it the sheriff gets to pick if he wants outside counsel or not, or is it you that gets to pick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8790)|
| 2:26:35| It's two different things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| No, no, no, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| I picked the outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| You picked the outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| I'm asking why didn't you decide to represent him instead of picking outside counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| Because I was already, apparently, from the information going around, I was conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| We do represent the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| That's my point exactly, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| The information that's going around is that you're conflicted, but you didn't decide to represent the sheriff first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| and hire outside counsel to represent the merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| It started off the merit counsel wasn't a party to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| It was a case where the merit counsel is simply sitting as a judge, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8833)|
| 2:27:21| That's all they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| They're sitting as a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| The sheriff comes in and says, look, they're not following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| That's his argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| The employee says, well, yeah, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| So the argument is between the two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8857)|
| 2:27:38| That's where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| So without a lawsuit, then it's going to wind up in a lawsuit anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| No, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| So why not head it off at the pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| But I'm still not understanding what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| I'm just trying to understand why you picked to represent one side versus the other originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| I didn't feel I had a choice because I had a duty under the charter to advise and tell everybody that they've got to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8878)|
| 2:28:07| I could not in good faith represent a merit counsel that, in my opinion, was violating its own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| I couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| Why didn't you represent the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Why didn't I do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| Why didn't you represent the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| But you hired outside counsel, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| No, we represent the sheriff in the most recent lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| You are representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| Then what's the outside counsel for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| To represent the merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| What about on the other lawsuits, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| I didn't represent either one because I had this issue that John Valiant raised, and I didn't really want to argue at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| But now it's come to the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| It's got to be argued, and it's got to be decided by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| So you're representing the sheriff, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| In the second lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| I thought you had outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| I thought you had outside counsel for both representing the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| That's where my confusion is, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| That was my confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| I'm trying to ask, like, why aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| What Director Book is saying is Prince is not representing the Knox County Sheriff's Office on the Nathan Cole case for merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| That's where my confusion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| I'm like, well, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| On the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| So one you are, one you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| Now I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Thank you for the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| I would just like to caution my colleagues that it would not be very advisable to vote to violate the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=8977)|
| 2:30:00| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9002)|
| 2:30:09| I probably shouldn't say this, but that's a matter of opinion, and we've been told that before, and it wasn't a violation of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9009)|
| 2:30:16| My question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Does the Merit Council have representation, outside counsel, for all the cases they have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9018)|
| 2:30:27| The Merit Council does not need outside representation of any kind in the two cases with Moore and Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9027)|
| 2:30:38| They're not violating any rules by having those hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| They don't need any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| They're the judge and jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| They don't need any counsel on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| And on the other two, Dooley, they do have outside counsel now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| In the lawsuit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| And there is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| They have outside counsel on that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Same person as the outside counsel for the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| And they're there only because they're required to be because it's a declaratory judgment action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| I guess I'll say this, and I hope I don't make too many people mad, but I've learned a lot about Merit Council over the last year, year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9068)|
| 2:31:24| and I've learned a lot about commissions' role in the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| And I'm not a fan of suing before they make a ruling because either way, in the end, somebody's still going back to court more than life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9089)|
| 2:31:42| I'm more of a fan of even if you believe they're not supposed to hear something, let them hear it, then take it to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9102)|
| 2:31:53| That could happen, couldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| It could, but it would seem to be a lot of waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| Well, we're wasting a lot of time and money right now on lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| So let it happen, then go to court, and then if judges overturn their decisions, that's where we as commission come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9123)|
| 2:32:13| hey, the Merit Council we've got aren't following the rules and doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| That's the only authority we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| At that point, we could change the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| So I don't know why these things get drug out and drug out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| Lawyers here, they'll have their hearing, and I'm sure whoever loses is going to wind up in court again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| So sometimes it's just best to let things happen, then go to court, then correct those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9153)|
| 2:32:44| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| I have a question or two, comment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| You make a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| However, what we're voting on is a little bit different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| We're voting on whether or not to direct the Merit Council to hire an attorney to represent them in all matters the council may deem necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9177)|
| 2:33:10| So my question is for Mr. Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| Is your interpretation of the charter that no county department can retain outside counsel independent from the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9193)|
| 2:33:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| Well, I would agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| These things are matters of opinion, and they're open to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| However, I'm not comfortable approving this on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| If this is going to be heard next week, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9223)|
| 2:33:50| But I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| This is a razor-edged interpretation of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| If it is okay for a department or a board of Knox County to hire outside counsel without the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9237)|
| 2:34:05| I'm going to have to see more proof of that before I can vote in the affirmative on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9245)|
| 2:34:15| I will not violate my oath to uphold the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| And I'm not comfortable tonight as to whether a yes vote would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| Well, as part of our rules, if this doesn't pass unanimously, it does not go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9264)|
| 2:34:32| Okay. Well, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| But if six votes votes it down, it's killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| I will look to the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| You have your light on, Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| I will amend my motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9296)|
| 2:35:01| Is the second agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| So, we have an amended motion to move this forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9304)|
| 2:35:11| That is by Commissioner Durant, with a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| We will, by voice vote, ask for all in favor of moving this forward without recommendation, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9319)|
| 2:35:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211213?start=9327)|
