| 2:09:01| across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| They have an alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| because community members, organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| and their chief of police did not feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| that the co-response was adequately meeting the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| and so they voted by public referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| for the alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| And so I think that shows that when states or cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| do things without community buy-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| you sometimes end up with programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| that aren't what the community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| I think, again, we want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| that there was nothing in the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| that talked about how alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| removes police from those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| and how having a police officer there can escalate calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| Like Sergeant Clinton said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| there are times that he has to arrest people who have warrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| and I get that as his role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| but it's another great reason to remove police from these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| If a police officer, their main responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| just in their job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| is not to help people in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| They're upholding the legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| So if we remove police from these calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| we just don't have that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| and the focus of the team can be just dealing with the crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| and the person in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| I also want to say I think it's concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| that McNabb talked about wanting to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| mental health professionals integrated in police even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| and as a licensed clinical social worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| I find that concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| People already have such difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| accessing mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| There are so many challenges and so much stigma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| and we don't want to associate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| mental health professionals with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| It just adds another layer of a potential barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| when people with vulnerabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| have had negative interactions with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| So I'm glad that you all are thinking about alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| and let's make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| Thank you, Ms. James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| Next we have Alex Riffwald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| Okay, glad I got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| If you'll give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Hi, I'm Alex Riffwald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| My address is 5522 Dogwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| I've talked to so many of you all through Zoom and phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| but never in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| so I'm excited to be here for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| I'm here as part of Knoxville HEART| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| to advocate for an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| I wish that we had been able to have a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| from an alternative response team come to this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| because you guys had so many great questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| about alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| that I think would be better asked to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| that are doing alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| I'm not going to go over what an alternative response team is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| because you guys already know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| The last few times I've spoken at city council on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| I have focused on the impact of those most affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| That's because I believe that when we create a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| to serve people, their needs and lived experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| should be the most important things we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| We know based on other cities that alternative response models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| proves better outcomes with less arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| and less risk of escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| We know that the International Association of Chiefs of Police states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| the mere presence of law enforcement vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| an officer in uniform and or a weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| has the potential to escalate a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| when a person is in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| We also know that people with serious mental health disorders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| are 16 times more likely than the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| to be killed during a police encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| Alternative response serves our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| While I prefer to advocate for the needs of those most impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| today I will focus on how the city would benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| from an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| The city of Knoxville could save millions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| and I will send you all the data on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| because there's lots of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| KPD claims to be chronically understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| As of October 2020, KPD has 45 open positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| In 2020, the city authorized $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| to be sent on branding and marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| to help the recruitment problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Understaffing led the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| to pay $2.1 million in overtime in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| Beyond the cost to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| research is clear that police overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| has alarming consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| The Sheriff's Department in King County in Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| found that working one additional hour of overtime per week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| increased the chances that an officer would be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| in a use-of-force incident the following week by 2.7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| and it increased the odds of an ethics violation by 3.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| Researchers have also found that inadequate sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| may heighten preexisting implicit bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| Both the police officers and the people they encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| suffer when burnout and exhaustion runs rampant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| inside a police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| In 2019, CAHOOTS responded to 24,000 calls for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| Only 150 calls required police backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| I feel like that astounding number is worth repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| 24,000 911 calls, only 150 backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| That's 0.6% of CAHOOTS calls requested police backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| In total, they answered 20% of all 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| Now, just imagine if Knoxville's alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| took just 10% of KPD's calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| Would KPD still be understaffed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| Would the taxpayers still have to pay out millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| for KPD overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| While the $400,000 expansion of the co-response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| seems pretty affordable, we have to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| that is on top of the police budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Police officers, police gear, and police cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| are being used to run this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Responding to a 911 call with a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| The co-response model makes it even more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| The data is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| In Eugene, cost per police response is $486.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| Cost per CAHOOTS response is $86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8063)|

| 2:16:00| Just for safety reasons, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8160)|

| 2:16:06| But I just ask that you bear with me, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8166)|

| 2:16:12| Just hear me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8172)|

| 2:16:17| but he humbled himself unto a bondservant and even unto death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| So God exalted him and gave him a name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| that was above every name that in the name of Jesus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8184)|

| 2:16:31| and he was resurrected and justified in the spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| That man, Christ, when he died, he died once and for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| for the remuneration of sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| And I tell you, you have faith in his blood alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| Have faith in his blood alone, knowing that no flesh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| shall be justified by the deeds of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| for by the law is the knowledge of sin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| And I've seen that by the commandment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| the commandment which was ordained to life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| was that ordained unto death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| So I tell you that if you trust in his blood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| for the remuneration of sins, you shall be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| Anybody that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| And I ask you to bear with me just a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I don't want to get to KPD, but I just want to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| that nobody comes to the Father except through the Son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| If you've seen me right now, you've seen the Son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| If you've seen the Son, you've seen the Father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| So I just want to tell you that you need to trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| in his blood atonement for the remission of sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| I'm telling you that only trusting in his blood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| for the remuneration of sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| I'm telling you that only trusting in his blood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| that's all he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| Many will say to him on that day, Lord, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| have we not cast out demons in your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| done many works in your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| He will say, get away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| Only those who do the will of my Father will answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| The will of the Father is that we believe in the one he sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| not that we do just works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| And I'm telling you that all sin that falls short of the glory of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| We're no longer under law, but we're under grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| And I tell you about grace, we have been saved through faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| It is the gift of God, so no one can bust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| And I tell you that no flesh shall be justified by the deeds of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| For by the law is the knowledge of sin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| I'm telling you, you can't work your way into heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8265)|

| 2:17:49| But it says that no flesh shall be justified by the deeds of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| But nobody in this courtroom right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| will glorify themselves in my Lord's presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8273)|

| 2:18:07| He just wants you to trust in his blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| Just trust that if it pleases the Father to see his Son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| crucified on the cross, for curse is any man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| who hangeth on the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| But he just wants you to trust in what his Son did on the cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| That's all he wants. He just wants you to trust in his blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Not that you should be justified in your works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| Not none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| So just go on to, and I didn't come here for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| but after I said the message of the cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| I just wanted to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| what they talked about and about all the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| that they were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| And I'm just going to go ahead and give it to you straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| because that's the only way I know how to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| They don't practice what they preach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| I am the one who, in 2016, they arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| multiple times for disorderly conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| And this man sat here today, and he said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| they don't want to arrest people all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| So I asked them, since when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| And I'm saying to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| is that they come here, they tell you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| hey, we only want to do this and that, we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| But I'm telling you that unless you're with them all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| then you will not see what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| So I'm telling you, he said, we only want to arrest people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| that we see are committing a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| But they came to me the other day, and they wanted to arrest me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| because they said that a woman said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| just by me saying my words in my mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| that she seemed threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| So just by her being threatened by what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| they said that they was going to take me to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| But I told them, I said, hey, it's like Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| casting a stone at Israel, and then Israel calls the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| What she did to me was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| it's like ISIS calling the attorney of affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| and saying that the police is messing with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| So by them just taking her word for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| they're about to take me to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| So what I'm saying to you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| these people don't practice what they preach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| So what I'm saying to you, they come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| and they say, yes, we were going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| and they tell you what you want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| But I'm telling you, these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| have been investigating me since 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| and I have did nothing since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| I tell you, everywhere I go, they investigate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| They say that they're not going to take you to jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| when you do something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| But I tell you, they're going to walk up to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| and you talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| Okay, let's look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| So he says, from this time point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| we haven't took anybody to jail who did certain crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| So whenever they made that theology about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| I want you to look at that time until right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| and I want you to look at all the arrest records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| and I want you to see if any of these arrest records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| have been determined to show that this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| could have walked free or that they had to take him to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| So from that time frame, whenever he established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| those arrests, he could have took him to jail, or he couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| And that's how you can tell if they're alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| So these people, they don't want to reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| They walk up to them, and you argue with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| they're going to say, get behind your back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| you're going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| They don't want to reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| So that's why all these dead bodies out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| they want to say, get behind your back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| you're going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| They don't want to reason, because they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| All they can say is this oily conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| you're going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| They don't want to reason, because they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| But in their mind, they say, we can take you to jail right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| for this oily conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| So it's in your best interest to do what we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| or we're going to take you to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| So they don't want to reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| They want to stone cold and say, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| if you don't do what we say, we're going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| So that's why the people are rioting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| And so that's why they can pick up the bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| from the other people, because they don't want to reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=8461)|
