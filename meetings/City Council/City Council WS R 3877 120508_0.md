| 0:01:36| Yeah, hopefully we'll make some good headway this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| We'll start out with a brief presentation by the administration, but before saw us will remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| I know we get a little excited at times and we don't have our lives in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| So, please let's you know kind of raise your hand like we had to do in the third or fifth grade and and be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| To hit your green button to speak. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| Thank you and very much I appreciate council's patience on all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| The administration is going to be very brief and we know the purpose here is for we all to deliberate in us to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| You in those deliberations as you see fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| I'm gonna go ahead and speak for about one or two minutes and then turn it over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| To Alan who's going to fill you in on some on the hybrid the new hybrid that it's not new the hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| We've shifted to based on the concern about the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| That was it been enunciated last time the sharing of the market risk and I will let Alan get into those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| I just want to preface our discussion with a with a sort of the three points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| We would like to make and why we're still very much committed to this hybrid as the what we think is the best approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| One we've to me. We've got three points that we'd like to make one this all the plans including this one are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| Reductions and plan benefits from where we are now their reduction in dealing with the changes in the retirement age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| also eliminating such things as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Rule of 80 which allow people to start collecting the retirement earlier and finally and we probably haven't discussed this as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| Reducing one of the big drains on the system right now, which is a cola| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Which is set at a very generous level and moving that to be capped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| At 3% rather than floored at 3% and that's a tremendous protection against against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| Later inflation so the plan itself has been limited secondly we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| Listened and know the great concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Which we went going in is to limit the taxpayer risk by limiting the defined benefit portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| The DB DC plus plan we thought had many advantages had the advantage of a little more simplicity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| Which is why we went initially with it though that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| I'll let that put a little more risk on the city and a little less of market risk on the on the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| We've switched to this other plan. I want to give credit to one of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Miss Whitaker who sent an email to all of us, and I read everything from everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| And I thought it was very insightful, which was you know they she'd heard that concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| Let's take a second look at another one of the hybrids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| So very much appreciate that and and as I told her I thought that was a very good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Shows there's a lot of wisdom in a lot of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Out there and third and this is the one that's become more relevant lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| And I'll stop with this one is the impact we need to consider the impact on the human resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Element of the city that is we are mostly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| individual performing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| and so there's a great management of human beings of human resources of people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| make and maximizing that delivery of services and in the way we we deal with that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| Our concern with a drastic move from a pure DB over to a pure defined contribution is that we'd set up a whole secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| new class of employees hired after a certain date and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| There is a high risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| I think of when we think of wreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Say wreaking havoc too strong a word but of massive changes that make the dealing with folks a lot different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| And I think we're at some levels risk being a little cavalier when we when we get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Corrections such as well. We can raise salaries to account for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| discount in benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Then you get into unattended consequences such as entry firefighters making having a higher salary than senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| Firefighters if you make such an adjustment and then the managing people end of this is critical and I'll end with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| It's critical here when we compare ourselves to the private sector and all of us are sensitive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| To the pressures that the private sector is facing and the retirement plans there and it's tempting to make a comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| the private sector does not have civil service and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Retirement decision is a voluntary decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| And I think the goal of having about a 60% of pay final pay figured as a retirement benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| I think is a reasonable one. We've had Allen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| underscored that and that if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Risking having a large number of folks who just find themselves through a defined contribution unable to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| We're going to have a lot of significant human resource issues down the line about people hanging on more than they should have in critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| Positions I would just sum by saying do we know all of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| No, we don't know what the impact will be. That's risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Also risk is not knowing something with certainty in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Just as risk is not knowing with something with certainly relative to stock markets future performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| so the plan that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| We're can right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| Recommending is this DB DC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Max plan that I'm going to let Alan describe and hopefully we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| present a case that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Convincing to it to to you that that's a wise ways to move to mitigating risk in all areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| Reducing the obligation and protecting the taxpayer which I everybody in here is sensitive to and we in this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Amir Rojero is as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| First let me ask I think I sent around a copy of this today. I had since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| Modified it and added a few more examples to clarify some of the issues if you have a page 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Well, actually the modified version last page is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| 15 I think the other one last page was 11. So if you don't have a updated version, please let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| I think I've handed one around everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=440)|
| 0:07:34| Yeah, I'll get I'll get I'll get samples out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Well, you only got a limited number. There's a stack right there behind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Yeah, I'll go ahead and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Dr. Lyons pass some of those out while he's passing those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Let me again say that it's a privilege to to be before you again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| And I appreciate the opportunity to be of assistance and what's obviously a very challenging process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| You know from my perspective. It's my goal to try to bring clarity to the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| You know on on issues that you asked me if I have an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| I will certainly tell you but at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| I want to help to bring as much information and clarity to the issues that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Regardless of you know, which side of the table that may support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| With regard to the concerns that were raised in the prior council meeting about the amount of risk in the DB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| DC plus plan being 70%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Is there something we could do to reduce that amount of risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| as dr. Lyons said we've looked at the DB DC max plan, which instead of being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| Defined contribution plus a defined benefit. It's the maximum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| Two different benefits. It's the maximum of a defined benefit component and of a defined contribution component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| I'll walk through some numerical examples in a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| I'm not going to go through all of this presentation unless there's something in the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| I sent you this morning if you if you flip through it and you've got specific questions about specific pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| I certainly want to spend as much time as you need me to but I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| Want to get through it as quickly as I can as I know your time is quite valuable valuable and you'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Happy to be finished up sooner rather than later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| I'll try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| That that will be my goal. So if I do not attain that please stop me and and tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| Let's look over if you would to page 11 which jumps right into some numerical examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| I think perhaps looking at a numerical example may be more instructive than talking about it in in generic terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| I'm going to start with the DB DC plus which is the plan that we previously discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| just to make sure that we're all on the same page with how that one works and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| then I will go to the DB DC max and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Compare and contrast that one and then and as I say as I go through this if this is not clear you have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| Please feel free to stop me on page 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| If we look at the DB DC plus for a member that retires with $40,000 final average pay was hired at age 32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| retires at 62 has 30 years of service in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| the DB DC plus in the DB component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| We are limiting pay to $40,000. This individual has $40,000. The basic formula is 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| Times average pay limited to 40,000 times service in this case. It's 2% times 40,000 times 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| I used an asterisk there instead of a X. So I apologize if there was some confusion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| But 2% times 40,000 times 30 is $24,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| So from the defined benefit component this individual would get a benefit of $24,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| Since he did not make more than $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| There would be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Contributions that had been made to the DC account because in the plus plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| You only get a DC account to the extent your pay is over $40,000 in this scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| Okay, so this person ends up getting $24,000 a year and there's no DC account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| Okay, everybody comfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| Second the next page second example page 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Same plan the DB DC plus general government hired at 32 retires at 62 but making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| $60,000 a year instead of 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| The DB benefit is the same because we're limiting pay in the DB component to $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| So it's still $24,000 a year same math same everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Well now he's been making over $40,000 for a good part of his career and account balance is accumulated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| $84,000 using a six and a half percent investment return assumption that keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Accumulation equates to approximately $6,000 a year as an annual lifetime benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| So in this plan configuration you take the $24,000 from the DB component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| That's guaranteed the six thousand which is not guaranteed because it could be more or less based on the account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| Add those together and this individual would get a benefit of $30,000 a year for the rest of their life with a COA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| Based on the parameters we've currently set out would be limited to 3% based on the CPI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| but a lifetime benefit of $30,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| Starting at 62 now, this is kind of all review from what we've already been over with a DB DC plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| But before I look at the max, is there any further clarification that you'd like on this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=754)|
| 0:12:42| If I could just be sure when this individual pays is 6%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| Does he pay 6% and until his ink his pay goes over 40,000 and it goes in the DB plan or easy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| Does it get allocated partly to one plan and partly to the other? How does how does this get funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| Excellent question for the person that makes less than $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| All goes DB. They're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| $60,000 then two-thirds goes into the DB and one-third goes into the DC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| So for pay in other words, he's making $60,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| How much that is greater than 40? Well, there's $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| So I'm going to put 6% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| 20,000 is an employee contribution into the account and then the 8% match on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| $20,000 goes into the account for that year and then you do the same thing every year and accumulate that to retirement. Thank you. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| Yes, mr. Saunders. Thank you. So on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| $84,000 whatever that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Does that assume you buy an annuity at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| That would assume that the defined benefit plan would have assumptions in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| That would convert that annuity that lump sum to an annuity and then that would be funded through the defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| The same way that we fund annuities at retirement under the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Page 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| DB DC max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Again, looking at a general government and and I've framed these on general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| The fire and police would work very similar different retirement age, but I'm not going to go through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| But for the general government again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| $40,000 hired 32 retired 62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| The DB component would be calculated the same way as in the plus plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| So you get the $24,000 a year but in this plan the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| $24,000 is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| minimum benefit that the employee will not get less than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| 24,000 when we look at the account balance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| This configuration in the max plan the 6% employee contributions is based on total pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| Going into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Account balance 8% contributions on total pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| So it accumulates to a bigger account balance because it's on all the person's plate just like a DC plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| then whatever that accumulates to in this case two hundred eighty thousand dollars that equates to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| approximate benefit of twenty two thousand five hundred dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| well, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| $24,000 is bigger than twenty two thousand five hundred this individual would get a benefit of twenty four thousand dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| For the rest of their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| So in this case the the account balance did not apply and they just got a benefit based on the defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| Yes, it's the maximum of a or B hence DB DC max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| Now for a person making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| $40,000 or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| It's just as likely that the DB benefit is going to apply versus the DC just because the way the plan was designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| So a lower paid person is going to have that 2% of pay sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| Minimum that's may kick in many, you know much of the time if you look to the next page 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| at a relatively higher paid person and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| You know, even though the average pay in general government fire and police is around 40,000. That's across the board for all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| That's not the average pay for retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| The average pay for retirees may be closer to fifty thousand dollars a year or fifty five thousand dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| I mean once people get to the end of their career, they've been here. They've moved up, you know designations or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| There's there are some people that retire at lower pay levels, but a lot of people retire at the higher pay levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| So the sixty thousand fifty five sixty thousand might be more typical in this case the defined benefit component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| Still provides the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| $24,000 minimum benefit because we're capping the pay at forty thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| But the account balance which is based on all pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| Accumulates to a much larger amount for this person making sixty thousand in this case almost four hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| Which equates to approximately thirty thousand dollars a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| So you compare the thirty thousand dollars to the twenty four thousand you get the maximum of the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| So this individual would get a benefit of thirty thousand dollars a year and you say well is that thirty thousand dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| Guaranteed well once they retire it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| But up into the point they retire the account balance, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| You may average six and a half percent. You could average seven percent. You could average, you know, five and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| I mean all of that flux in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| The employee is absorbing those gains and losses unless they fall below the point where they hit the twenty four thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| You know in this example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Yes, the twenty four is the floor. That's right. It's exactly right. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| You know in this example, it might be a four percent average return for thirty years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Where they break even so to the extent the fund got less than four percent for thirty years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| Then the city starts to have risk at that point, which is why this plan is shifting more risk to the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1082)|
| 0:18:12| Particularly for the higher paid employees the lower paid employees still are not taking very much risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| But the higher paid employees are taking relatively more risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| So this is about a 50-50 split in the risk versus the 70 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| Risk profile that we had in the DB DC plus plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Let me recognize councilman grief, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| It for if they're making forty thousand dollars or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| I mean if they're making twenty thousand dollars or more than you base it on twenty thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Because the pay is capped at forty. So but yeah, assuming they make forty or more than twenty four thousand becomes the base. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1140)|
| 0:19:09| Well, once they get to retirement the account balance of three hundred ninety thousand is not guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| It could accumulate to whatever it accumulates. But once you convert that to a monthly benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| Then that amount is guaranteed and locked in for the rest of their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Right, there's no reflection of the stock market after retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1164)|
| 0:19:36| Once they get the $30,000 and that's what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| For the pre retirement risk, which is a lot of the money that you're putting in to accumulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| That risk is being shared the post retirement risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| is still largely being borne by the city, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| you know if you start moving over more of that risk, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| At some point, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| You get to a hundred percent and you basically got a DC plan where they're subject to a hundred percent of the market risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| For the entire career. So I mean I I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Believe that the the point was to try to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| equitable sharing between the city and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| That was my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Let me follow up on his question because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Thought you were saying when you get to retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| You obviously look and find out which pots bigger. You're not going to pick the smaller pot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| They go to the bigger pot. Yes at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Do you literally buy like an insurance product annuity that pays out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| No, you've got all the assets in the pension plan just like you currently have and you say, okay this person's retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| So now we're gonna set him up as a retiree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Getting you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| $2,500 a month or whatever and then at that point it just becomes administered just like the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| You've got assets and you got benefit payments and you know, so that explains your comment after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| the person elects retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| the benefit scheme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Goes on and in fact, it escalates with some cola over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| But that risk in that time frame is the city's risk. Yes the retirement risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| In the middle of that you've got a semi-empty pot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| The idea and my suggestion would be once somebody retires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| Take those assets and invest them relatively more conservatively for inactive liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| Right, I mean something relatively more conservative and it would be up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| discretion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Pension board as to what the appropriate mix would be which would also affect what the conversion rate would be when we convert it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| An annuity and so forth. So I've assumed a 6% post retirement return right now if that's deemed to be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| It's certainly much more conservative than the current investment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| But whatever the investment policy is would drive that. Yes, but that policy then says okay this person's retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| We know we're paying it out an income stream. So we try to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| A more conservative mix for for this pot of money of the group of retirees the inactive workers. I believe that is correct. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| All right. Thanks. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Did not hear any mention of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Cost of living increases in the base in the 40 base 40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| In this example, I've assumed a 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Increase in the base and a 4% increase in pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| And the reason I've suggested that as a starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| if we increase the base approximately with a cost of living then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| proportional amount of risk sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| stays approximately the same over time if the base is not indexed over time then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| Proportional amount of risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Changes so a generation of employees that's hired in five years would have a different risk profile than it's hired in 10 years or 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| years or 30 years, so what I was suggesting is if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| risk profile was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Decided that okay. This is the correct risk profile then presumably you'd want that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| Be relatively static over time in order to be treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Different generations of employees the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Observation it just seems to me like once again at the end. We don't know our risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| We're kind of in the same boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| At least it feels that way to me. I mean a defined benefit plan has risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| There's no doubt about that if you're gonna have a defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Then there's gonna be some investment at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| And then it's a matter how you're gonna share the investment risk if you want no investment risk defined contribution plan does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| You know it doesn't do some other things very well, but it does that excellent. You know it's very very efficient at doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| Councilman Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| When you say health cost are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| We have several plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Are you talking about post retirement medical plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Yeah, the medical plans is a totally different issue from the retirement and is not part of this analysis at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1468)|
| 0:24:50| This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Would be a bit higher than the DB DC plus, but not as high as the DC only so it's about in between if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1495)|
| 0:25:05| If you look back, I think on page 9 or 10, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Page 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| I've estimated approximately 100 basis points additional cost over the DB DC plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| It would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| About a hundred basis points less than the DC only the long-term expected cost that less risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| The the city would be taking on less risk with the DB DC max as opposed to the plus plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| the employees would have the potential for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Relatively higher benefits versus the DB DC plus and since on average the benefits are a little bit higher of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| the average cost is a little bit higher, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| The volatility would be expected to be relatively less than the DB DC plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1548)|
| 0:26:00| That takes us back to this blue line that you couldn't see on the screen correct because right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| Why is that of necessity higher because there is no pot that's growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| What is the what is the thinking of why why which line is higher the blue line blue line is that's the top line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Yes, okay. The blue line is higher for a couple reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| number one in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| DC only if somebody becomes vested and leaves then presumably they would take their entire account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| Employee and employer money the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| out of the pot in the DB plan and the hybrid plan the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| First of all the entire pots not available as a lump sum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Secondly if they terminated and they were vested and wanted money they could get a refund of employee contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| Which in fact a lot of people do plus interest plus 4% interest on the current provisions and then employers share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| No, they don't get the employer share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| They forfeit money back with interest right and and the difference is that forfeiture and that makes the overall cost of the hybrid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| less than the cost of the DC only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| Anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Well, I'm gonna go back to and I thank you Alan for taking my call on Saturday and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| Spent an hour going through this. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Go through this line by line with you and not what I like about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| The max plan is is that it there is a guaranteed portion to the pension and it's my belief that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1652)|
| 0:27:41| There's a city employee that the amount of work that the work they do and the kind of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| They do that are not only doing it for the voters and the taxpayers of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| But they're doing for everybody that sets foot into this into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And they're doing it over a long period of time and in all hours of the day and night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| And I believe it's that type of employee it sets itself apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| From the public sector that they are a lot different their role and their job is a lot different than than any employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| I have that would work and they're doing stuff on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| People that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| That don't pay to him directly and and then we're reaping the benefits along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| There are a lot different employee for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| philosophically, I think that it is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Think it's reasonable to ask the city of Knoxville to guarantee them a pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| To guarantee them a set number a set dollar amount like what we've done here and this plan puts it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| on the average of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| 40,000 it could be less than that. That's at 40,000 is a number we can tweak you want it less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| You want it 22 5 you can run it you can run there run that 30 about 40 down to 35 if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| There are some multipliers in here if we can agree to the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| But I believe that the city employees as employees of government deserve some type of guaranteed pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| The the benefit of this plan as I see it is that the money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| That is paid into the defined contribution piece of it. It's still the city's money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| It's still in it's still in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| It's on behalf of the city if it grows at rated higher than six and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| Then they get the benefit of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Pretty nice. That's a pretty nice deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I mean and if it doesn't grow at that then you know then then we're still back down to the there's there's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| 24,000 now if it grows substantially less than and we can't make it up then we're still guaranteeing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| 24,000 so there is some risk, but it's not that big a risk. There's risk on every employee. I have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| I'm gonna pay their health insurance. I mean, I'm gonna pay other benefits to them. I mean there is some risk so I think that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| philosophically, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| committed that we should have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| pension plan for the city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| And we can tweak the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| And I think this plan gives the benefit if if they're if their rate of return can equal six and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| They might walk out a little bit more you take that money at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| They retire you set it aside put it in guaranteeing something. You know really low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| And it's their money now and then it's set so I think this is a really good alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| I think it accomplishes what I was trying to get at last time with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| In my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Amateur way of trying to lower the risk down to where it's you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| It's balanced between the city in or to an you know certainly the city and the employee so I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| But we've got the we've got the control if we write this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| To set the COLA if that's what we want to do we can have I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| I think that we write some rule that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Where it comes back to council and we get the we get to say so on whether we've got the money into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| so there's a way to write that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| I think if you want to even lower the risk down below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| 24,000 you could you can play around with that 40,000 number for the general employees, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| You know I think philosophically you got to decide whether you even want a guaranteed pension plan or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| That's where some of us are and some of us aren't but I mean I mean for me. I think it's you know I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| Fully support some type of hybrid plan that limits the city's exposure, but also provides something guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1881)|
| 0:31:32| Councilman can I ask Alan another question he was talking before about the DC plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| And once you vest in five years or ten years whatever the number is you pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| That's a pot. That's basically yours, and it's portable so it goes with you in in this hybrid world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| When you get over the 40,000 you have a separate pot does that same rule apply in other words if it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| No, no in the hybrid world that the only purpose of having an account balance is to have the basis for an ultimate benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| When you get to retirement if you don't get to retirement, and you want your money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| You can take your refund of employee contributions plus interest plus interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| And it doesn't matter whether parts in the DB and parts in the DC. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| So so you the goal is to make it to retirement, then you get to pick the bigger pot. That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Guess if I could follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| Your numbers your numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Your numbers are using a cola up to 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| Obviously we don't know what that is until we live through an experience. I heard mr.. Wallace say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| Could that be defined in a way so that it's calculated as a cola up to 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| With an added criteria that if there ain't no money in the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| We can't put it in in the pot so to speak or there's some discretion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Limits that certainly you get into a really dry year. What do you do certainly I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| It's been suggested, and I've read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Situations where some states have adopted a cola subject to the funded ratio of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| So if the funded ratio that is the assets divided by the liabilities is less than 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Then you might not award a full cola| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| During that year, and you might say another way of saying you're underfunded yes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| Well it wouldn't hit you see you see those formulas in your head in your case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| It wouldn't hit the six and a half percent right so it hits five percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| You hit five percent. You don't have as much assets as you thought you'd have then you say okay. We're gonna just call up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| This year or something whatever right, but you'd have I mean my proposal is you'd have that vote right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Then you could decide well wait a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| We do only have five percent, but we still don't have any money to afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| So you still maybe but you'd have that control here as opposed to building into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| And we're just automatic where it's automatic. I think the automatic is really one of the things that got us in trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| You know you're funding 70. You don't you don't have the money to pay for I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Council could certainly put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Parameters as part of the benefit structure that just said this plan will provide this cola under these circumstances, and that's just how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| Yeah, I think bud Gilbert talked about that in a previous workshop. I don't I haven't seen him come in today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| But I thought he would not be able to attend the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Cherries there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| So so that's a tentative tentative yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2074)|
| 0:34:43| Councilman grave, did you have another question? Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| Customer stare well, I just wanted to I handed out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| Alternate defined contribution plan. I think Alan for explaining that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| The plan I presented here can be explained in two sentences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| Employees in the city are required to contribute 3% to a DC plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| The city will provide an equal match for an employee's voluntary contribution up to 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| Does everybody understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Why three no six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Well first I just wanted to show that's one of the benefits of a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| Mr.. Pennington did a very good job, but it did take him a while. There were a number of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| It's complicated to explain. It's complicated to explain to voters. It's complicated. It's complicated to explain employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| Defined contribution plan is very simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| The reason where I got this from is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Murfreesboro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| They adopted it for new employees on July 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| 2010 some of the other information there. There's a vesting. It's a five-year vesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| 100% after five years so if someone leaves before five years all of the city's contribution to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| Goes into a forfeiture and that money can be used to pay for other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| some of the other parts are there of the plan, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| I just want to to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| The fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| We're not the first organization to look at this problem, and we certainly aren't going to be the last it's happening all across our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| Private organizations have been dealing with this for decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| And there is a very very very clear trend toward defined contribution plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| A GAO report estimated that less than 18%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Private employees have a defined benefit plan. I would I would guess that in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| Actually, I don't know so I'm not going to guess whether we're above the national average or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| But we're not the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| I've heard a lot of things that we're worried about a drastic change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| wreck wreaking havoc walking off a cliff well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Murfreesboro adopted this plan on July 1st 2010 and I would like you to look to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Comparisons there at the bottom. It's a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Smaller than Knoxville. It's roughly about half the size. It has the same sort of proportion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| safety employees as we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| They're starting salaries for police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| The recruit salaries are very very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| The biggest difference really between the two cities is that Murfreesboro is a lot more wealthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| The average household income is significantly higher than Knoxville. So they're having a lot more competition with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| private sector I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Talked to I called the HR Department and they explained to me. They had a defined benefit plan prior to this July 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| It it was they had a 2% multiplier and it was capped at 60% the employees were not required to contribute at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2285)|
| 0:38:14| Retirement was at 65 for general employees and 55 for fire and police seemed like a very generous plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| In 2008 they started a process looking at it. They brought in experts seems like they really went about the correct way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2301)|
| 0:38:30| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| They felt that the and the employees also felt that you know, a defined contribution was was was good. It was portable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| It was what a lot of the younger employees were looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Their counsel adopted this plan unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| When I asked the HR person if they noticed any difference, they she said and this is Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| McFarland as is her name CH RS MC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| FAR LA NE she said that they had not noticed any differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| I asked her if they had to adjust salaries. They have not had to make any adjustment in salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| So to say that it's this drastic change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| I think Murphysboro is an example of of a organization that has adopted it and has not I talked with the City Council member there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| Shane McFarland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| and he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| That they've that it was unanimous people were very positive about it and they haven't noticed any changes at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| They haven't had to make adjustments. He said they had eight positions for the police department. They have 1,500 applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| This is not you know, I didn't make this up. This is a city that's similar to Knoxville. It's not the exact same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2383)|
| 0:39:51| That has adopted a plan with no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| So that's that's that's what the proof is. So I think that's that's why I modeled this plan after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| And I think we need to remember why we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| I gave you some information. It's not just Murphysboro Johnson City and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| Kingsport have adopted these as well. Johnson City has a percent of payroll their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| Contribution their pension plan was at 19%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Murphysboro told me that was at 14% Kings Kingsport. It was up to 16% I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| Did some calculations today. We're this at the 1213 budget. We're up to over 21% guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| This is just a huge amount of our budget going into this and as that number creeps up to 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| I mean it as a percent it gets close to 30. We are here because the fine benefit plan is broken and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Feel good about these numbers and projections and that's what the council's did in the past. That's what the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| And the voters did in 2006 when they adopted the sheriff's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| They're broken. Maybe it would work for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| But sooner or later, it will break a divine contribution plan will not break it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| It is what it is. It's paid every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| That's you know, that's what I would like to emphasize is that this has been done before and it's not just small cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| There's a referendum on the ballot for June for San Diego to switch the vast majority of their employees to define contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| the mayor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Philadelphia who's a Democrat is pushing negotiating with the unions in Philadelphia to switch to define contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| This is like I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Johnson City and Kingsport in the last two years. I've both switched so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Mean, we've got a problem here. And I think you know, the fix is a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| I think the hybrid is certainly a step in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Because it does reduce the risk, but it's still what it is is a new defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| So I just I just don't feel comfortable supporting and especially knowing the tax increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| I think if we were having this conversation when we had a proposal for a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| It might be a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We might and I think the other important thing to look at is that median household income in Knoxville is 32,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| these are the households we're going to be raising their taxes to pay these pensions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Certainly like I've said time and time again have so much respect for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| They work hard and put their life on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| But a lot of people in Knoxville who are going to be taxing work hard, I mean think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| all the different types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| People that work for and we talk about public and service service employees. There's a lot of private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Employees that work hard that come home tired cooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| That that work their tails off and they don't have access to this kind of plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| So I still just don't think it's fair to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Have them pay for a plan that they just don't have access to so that's my main points that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| And other cities have done this and this is what I would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Look, well, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Let me follow up on that. I mean, I think what doctor health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| Dr. Lyons began the evening out is the difference in between what we do here and what Murph, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| What Murphysboro John City Kingsport, you know, whatever they do and I can think back to the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| So I don't think we do them anymore, but we used to do surveys of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| They would rank the departments and you know, I know the fire employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I mean the the fire department was always the first and police was close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| I think a little bit different job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Descriptions and they may not some people may not be as happy because they have to go to places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| They don't want to go but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| We we've got great employees and the reason we have so is because of what we've been able to offer them and granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| We got a problem, but we're here fixing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| I mean, we can't revert back and can't move forward based on the mistakes that we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| I mean, we've put a lot of time and effort and a lot of thought and debate on how to fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| And and I really feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| My councilman Wallace said that this is this is something that that is good for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| It's good for the employees. I mean they I mean, I'm gonna say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| They have given up a tremendous amount because they realize I've had so many employees tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| I know y'all got to do something just be fair with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| And and I think we're there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I think this is the most fair way and I obviously struck a chord with you when I said we went off a cliff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| And the only reason I say that is because it's just so different from what we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| And I just think that that's just too drastic a change to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| From from what we've had to just to a DC plan and based on what our actuaries telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| It's gonna cost more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| This plan or the plan whatever we adopt whether it be the hybrid or the DC won't take effect for ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| Ten years, so we've got opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| If things go further south, you know, I tend to believe that you know, it's down this far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| I mean, this is the worst time we've had since the Great Depression and and you know, maybe I'm optimistic or naive or coy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| Whatever, but I feel like it's going to go back up and I feel like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| We're in a position to where we can make I feel like this is a drastic change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Probably not happy with it, but they understand they've been reasonable and I just think it's a great mix and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| In and I hope that we can drop adopt what's been presented here tonight and move forward with it and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| You know, if we've got to take a leap of faith, let's take it, but I don't think it's that I think it's good solid planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| Lot of thought a lot of debate. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| That's my thoughts on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Given all of these plans a great deal of thought and I've looked back on experiences. I've had in different places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| Regarding retirement changes in plans and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| Some years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Where I worked and I was in a public employee in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| We no longer became people we were referred to as units and each job site had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| X number of units and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| half a unit was a custodian a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| 3-4 of a unit was a secretary and a teacher was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Almost a unit and the principal was a unit and a half and I found that to be very demeaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| It's humorous in some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| But I also found it to be very demeaning and as I thought about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| I think it struck a chord with me that the very radical switch to defined compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| Puts dollars on all of our employees foreheads and we can sit here and say that we value what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| We understand how important it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| But the bottom line is we're putting a dollar sign on their forehead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| And I don't think that that's what the people of the city of Knoxville expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| We are moving forward as a tourist town. We are moving forward in attracting some new businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| Forbes called us one of the six best cities in the nation for a job growth today. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| We spent several years now talking about the doom and gloom the world has fallen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| Well, apparently now it's picking itself back up a little bit. So I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| Would not be able to support a defined compensation plan. I think it's just too radical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| Mr. Pennington, I appreciate your coming back to the table today with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| couple council members asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| There may come a time down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| when we need to look at something different than defined benefits and I have the feeling that if the stock market starts flying high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| Again, and other kinds of investments that make a lot of money start flying high again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| Then defined contribution will be very attractive at the same time. I also know that we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| Who you know looking at twenty four thousand dollars a year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| Not very much money for a person to live on in a retirement plan and after you take taxes and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| We're looking at some other sources of income that people may depend on that may not be as available either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| So I really think that we need to not see our employees as dollar signs or units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| But rather as human beings who do a good day's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Who try to do the things that make our city attractive and welcoming and most important make us all feel safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| And we hear time and time again from people who come to this city from other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| How nice everyone is and they're not just talking about taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| But they're talking about employees and people they meet and I think that we must keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| as we look at some of the attractive features of some other plans, but I really do think the hybrid is the way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| need to go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Councilman Wallace, I appreciate you were asking questions that got answers that I think that we all needed to to have clarifying. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2967)|
| 0:49:36| I'm working on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| Teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| Counselor I just want to respond. I certainly don't want to treat employees like like dollar signs at all, but it's about how do we provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| services to the city in the most efficient way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Right now 20% of our money is going into pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I don't know if that's the best way in terms of recruitment and training and everything we're talking about. I just don't see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| It's the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| allocation of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And talking about dollar signs, that's the thing to me that just gets me about the defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| Benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| You know, it's got a cost. It's got a dollar sign. We just don't know what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| And you cannot get around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| You can't tell me what it's going to be next year or the next year or the next year. You don't know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| So it's got a dollar sign too, and you're putting so that's it's putting a dollar sign as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| And so, you know, I think I mean this I mean this is a this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Our budget and and dollars and where they should go. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| propose a modest plan because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| The way to really recruit and retain employees is through increased salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| And that's something I'm for and I'd also propose that we bring Mercer back in to look at our salaries if we adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| the defined contribution plan to push the salaries up but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| You know, it's about I mean, it's it's about dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| I don't see how you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| But one has a known cost and one does not so and if you look at the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| They usually hover around 3% I think that's for a reason they know that they can recruit more people if they have higher salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| It didn't I don't see that in our in these plans that there's much much thought to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Councilman Del Valle. Yeah, I just wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Marshall or Alan depending on maybe both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| we taught we left the last time with the notion that if we had a defined contribution plan we had to think of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| Disability element I noticed you have a hardship withdrawal where you can take your money out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| But but did did the Murfreesboro folks deal with the you know, the injured fireman worker or whatever that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| It ends up getting a disability retirement and if not, how do we deal with that piece to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| Because we have more than just a retirement plan. We have a retirement plan with a disability, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I've always you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3134)|

| 0:52:20| Just do it with insurance. Right Alan. Did you see anything different with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| No, that's my understanding that it would be a separate independent disability insurance policy just by coverage for someone who gets hurt, that's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| It's sort of like workers comp only. It's a disability retirement. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| That's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3158)|

| 0:54:06| Over the next 15 or 20 years the total cost between a hybrid or DC only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| Is not particularly material when you look at the total dollar cost going into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| The vast majority of the contribution going into the plan over the next 20 years has to do with the unfunded liability in the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Whatever decision is made about new employees is not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| materially impact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3269)|
| 0:54:43| Depends on what the match is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Mean if we put a defined contribution plan that had previously been discussed with the 10% match for fire police and 8% match for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| general government the cost would be approximately 9% of payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Just averaging the two right the payroll of they're not exactly the same, but it's proximate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| if we put a defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| benefit plan in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Like the DB DC max the expected contribution might be between seven and a half and eight percent of payroll going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| Assuming a six and a half percent investment return and to the extent over the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| That investment turn was or was not realized would of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Impact that the the fundamental problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| I would suggest and the reason that we currently have a large unfunded liability is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| Because there was a time that the inactive liability was a hundred percent funded if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| Liability had been de-risked and locked in and set aside on the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| We would still have some meaningful unfunded liability today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| But we'd be talking thirty million dollars of unfunded liability not a hundred and thirty million dollars, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| I'm saying that once the person retires that the asset should be invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Less aggressively to reflect and we didn't do that. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| The way it's set up right now, it's a board decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| It's not it's not a council decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| But you know from everything that's happened and from the people on the board that I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| There's a lot of momentum to re-evaluate that and even though you can't just go in and flip a switch and say we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| Do everything different today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| My impression is that whatever DB plan is in place whether it's just the current DB plan or whether it's the current DB plus some new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3384)|
| 0:56:32| hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Oversight and investment policy is going to be much much different than it has been in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3395)|
| 0:56:56| Yeah, I mean to the extent you're looking at the new employees, and you and you're looking at that piece of the graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| Then yeah, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| If you assume that the defined benefit plan the new defined benefit plan would be invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| In a less aggressive more conservative way, then there's going to be less volatility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| It's going to be more predictable, but you know a DC plan. I mean not that's defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| You know what it is. I mean everything that people have said regarding to find contribution plan is absolutely accurate. I've got no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| disagreement with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Councilman Wallace, please. Well, I'm going to go back to the philosophical differences between a defined contribution and a defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3447)|
| 0:57:38| You've heard that these employees get up and just think about it in your own company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| If you're back my most valuable, I'll say it to myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| My most valuable employees are the ones that have been with me for a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| The reason these employees stay here a long period of time is because that because of the fact that they're a part of the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| Here a long period of time is because that because of the pension because of a guaranteed pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| You turn it into a defined contribution that that money is theirs. They walk out with that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| so now you've trained them and now they have no reason they have no more incentive to stay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| the cost goes up that money leaves the plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| In this plan in these in these in these hybrid plans the money's belongs to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| You control the money, I mean so the cost goes out the window now, there's there's risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| I don't care what you say about the fine contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| There's risk on everything because the intended there's risk on well, you just added a disability insurance component to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| I mean it right there you just you know, go figure what the cost is and disability income on a on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Fire and police I gotta believe it's a lot higher than it is on a real estate guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| So, I mean, it's it's pretty it's gonna be significant. That's a cost. You're gonna have to look at I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| Think we go back to what I brought up last time and bill lines and then picked up on it. I'm glad they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| It's her it when you start managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| You you have I don't know how many managers you have in the city of Knoxville and soups shifts supervisors and so forth when you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| managing based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Raises you've given certain employees because they don't have a defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Against ones that do and don't and back and forth. You're creating a management nightmare and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| And you're all of a sudden you've got two classes of people even with even with this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| It's going to be it's going to be something to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| It's it's going to be something they're going to have to take training on and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| They're going to have to work on and ease this transition into and I think it to make a real big switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| Would it's going to put your employees at risk and I'm just I'm not sure that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| That's what you want to do. The second thing, you know, the employees it is is in my business and in this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| It's no different the employees are your biggest asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| That's what you're paying for you're paying for that and that's what you know in the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| And so it's not it's not something that's here replaceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| It's not like we got some product that somebody wants and we're in the focuses on the product products on the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| And getting the job done. So I think that it's it's something that you know, philosophically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| This is a you know, the conversations I've been having myself over the last couple months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| Trying to really it is different than private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| I mean, I believe that it's totally different and that's something that I've really come to wrestle with and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| I really you know as we've gotten into that I really believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you, I just wanted to make a brief comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| And that is that I very much respect all the time and energy that all the council members have put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Many of the comments that mr. Grieve. Mr. Saunders. Mr. Stair have made I agree with I think there's some very compelling reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| That a fine contribution plan makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Otherwise, you know not so many people would put them in on the other hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| I think there's a lot of compelling reasons that define benefit plans make sense, but I don't want to you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| Parade a lot of different information around everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| Clearly, there's a few folks on the board that are on the DC side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Clearly there's a few folks on the board that are on the hybrid side a few folks on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Then I'm not sure where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| The the folks that are on the side, I guess I wanted to ask the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| You know if there's any information that I can bring clarity either toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Why does it define contribution plan make sense because I think there are some good arguments for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Or why does a hybrid plan make sense because I think there's some good arguments for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I'll be happy to give you information if it's going to help you make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| I can bring studies or send you studies that say, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| DC plans make sense because of this DV plans make sense because of this but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| if you guys are kind of decided in your mind about where you want to go, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| I don't need to share any more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| So I guess I just want to throw that out and say if there's anything else that I can provide that's helpful for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| Let me know and you know, and if not, then that's fine, too. But I just wanted to offer that up. Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| Did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Well, I was just gonna again. Thank everybody and we recognize how complicated this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| I just want to make one comment on the human resources end of it which gets to again risk and unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| And I think many people have picked up obviously on defined benefit. There is market risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| That's by definition and there's not with defined contribution. It's defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| That is and you can look at a few cities and a few communities that are that are moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| We don't have any experience over a long period of time as I look at this. I can't get past one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| I think has to be on the table and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| once you bring in new folks and they go through the cycle if you're on a 401k type of thing such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| With the kind of contribution levels that that could accompany those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| What are the consequences of having a set of employees with rights with employment rights who find themselves unable for financial reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| to retire and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| That are in specially but not limited to in public safety and in say public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| It is very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I think in the public sector because of the nature of that job and the degree I think councilman Wallace said and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| Vice mayor Pavlis because of the nature of the position of the mouth that the public relies upon them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| That is a tremendous unknown. There is great risk in something like that because it is an unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| It doesn't show up in three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| It was going to show up in 20 years or so and I and that is why you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| We can quarrel with wreaking havoc is too strong language and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| But I wouldn't want to and I would like to underscore it is an unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| And just make sure that that doesn't get eliminated at least to me from it's very important in my thinking through of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| Issues are that also want that balance against the market unknown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| I think those are two sets of unknown that are in balance here. I think that's what the philosophical issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| Councilman Del Bocchi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3840)|
| 1:04:12| Maybe if he's willing to stand up there and come visit with us to tell us a little bit about this idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| The board's management and are you looking at ways to take less risk? And and what have you seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| recently in that regard I mean a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Comment was made earlier like well, maybe the markets gonna pick up and things are good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| But of course anyone who reads the paper knows that that Europe seems to be blowing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| I mean France is tired of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Restrictions and so was it so were the Greeks and they're all riding in the streets and they want to spend every last dollar and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| Going down the toilet. What are you guys doing to to moderate risk as you as you manage the portfolios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3885)|
| 1:04:53| Well, we have been speaking with pension board for some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Of course, there has been a change and there's some new members on so we're having to revisit some of those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| Which we're going to be doing certainly over the summer months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| And this idea of de-risking is in the plan that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| Irrespective of what the decision going forward is is just exactly that point of how do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| Do we transition if you will in my view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| And again, this is I don't want to speak to the pension board on you know, they all have to individually make up their decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| but how we can transition from where our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| investments are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| to a position where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Again in my view, they're more lined up with the liabilities of the fund as Alan mentioned those people that are already retired and receiving benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| That we that we move over time and this wouldn't be something that we do in any short order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| You know that this could probably take years, but but clearly that's the idea of discussing a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| So that we have a plan of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| If and when there are market conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| You know as they exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| We already have have discussed and have a plan as to how we're going to react to that and what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| When those events occur, I think that's you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Just in any sort of an emergency and one could argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| This is somewhat of an emergency here that we're in that you want to have a plan in case of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| Things happen that you can't control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| That you have discussed what you would want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| We refer to it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Triggers or things that are going to set that off our funded ratio for instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Which currently at the seven and three eighths percent the new assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| Is around 70 71 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| Certainly it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Even in the more near term that maybe that could be a goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| That yes, that's the assets compared to the total I was just a percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| Market value that you have that's covered the current liabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| And certainly any sort of a plan like that as you say in the certainly the conditions today where there is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| Presumption that things are going to get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| And we can certainly talk about those plans, but certainly even today and of more immediate is if things don't get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| You know what's our plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| I would think in the much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Shorter term to be sure that we I think we all understand currently where we're at that we couldn't afford I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4048)|
| 1:07:37| Can't say again you can't avoid another 2008 not that it's going to be to that degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| but whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| You know the conditions in the market are if it does decide you know to kind of go south again for whatever reason in the short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| Term then we have a discussion about that and make sure we understand and look at that funded position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| And and and do what we can in pretty short order to try to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| You know our position as exist. Do we have a current policy where someone retires that that pot gets into a more conservative plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| That we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| That's the reason we need to have some serious discussions. I think the board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| Decide where we want to go and again. We're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| We understand to you're talking about the cost going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| You know on that and the investment returns again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Would you look at the better times as Alec had mentioned at one point investment returns were terrific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| You know and all of these liabilities were funded at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| so it is a fine line between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Attempting to de-risk, but also what I would say not leaving money on the table for the city. You know we could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| To a very conservative policy tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| But those charts that you see as you would see those returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| It's like you see you haven't seen anything yet, so you have to be careful, but you do have to have again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| I suggest a plan I think in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Pension world a lot of reference to kind of a glide path how you go from where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| To where you are positioned a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| And again like in today, where would you with this low yield environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| That is you know the interest rates being so low that just I mean that's part of not just our pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| But every pension plans problem when you cannot you know just get a decent yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| Off of it. It's it makes it extremely difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| To some extent I don't want to say forces you into risk, but certainly you're considering those things where you can get some return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4177)|
| 1:10:01| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| The this meaning the plan we're discussing now going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4209)|
| 1:10:23| Well I thought our discussion today was choosing which choosing among the new plans and that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4223)|
| 1:10:31| A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Well we're talking about an estimate of 9% of payroll under the DC mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| Pennington said that we would start paying on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| For new employees as they started on January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| 2013 if we went to a new plan and a little less than that going into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| pension fund to take care of all the assumptions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| You know for the hybrid under the under the DB DC max plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| That is those are relatively the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| Paying for these the plans from which we're choosing between in this case are about the same in fact slightly less for the for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| Hybrid plan going forward taking the existing plan. We can't do anything do anything about off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| So we're going to paying for them is a constant between the two. I mean you know it's it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| almost six one half dozen the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4291)|
| 1:12:01| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4321)|
| 1:12:21| Again the cost of the new plans is a constant between the new plans as to we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Presented this year's budget this year as to how and it is funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I think obviously as it prepared the the next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| We'll have to address all the ways that we're going to deal with the additional X million dollars that have to I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| Seven that that will have to go into that, but I think that that is another those are as I those are separate discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| I mean this this choice today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Cannot affect the other I mean so I don't know what somebody else would like to speak to that or the mayor would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Say what I've said before you know there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Next year actually starting now now that I've now I've given the budget to you all and you can decide what you're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| With that we're already starting to talk about how we reduce costs for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| You know we have to look at what our revenues will be so we'll be projecting revenues based on the economy based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| You know the property tax rate sales tax and all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| So we'll be projecting our revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| And we'll be projecting what our fixed costs are and then there's you know that you have to you have to reduce costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| And you have to raise revenues, and so there'll be some combination of that, but I can't tell you more now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| I can't tell you exactly how we'll do it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| But but we are already looking at that and starting to project I talked to Eddie Maness about that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| And I know he and Jim York are already looking. You know where can we save money? Where can we reduce costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| What are the what are the costs that we know will be going up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| And you know that we have to account for and then what are our projected revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| So it's something that we will definitely be working with counsel on as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| Do this you know preparing for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| But we have that unfunded liability that we have to pay for but these what we're talking about the basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| Benefits we're going to have employees what we're all about service as someone has mentioned already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| You know we exist to provide public safety and to provide joint services to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| That's why people come together in cities and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Political subdivisions like like a city and so we will have certain costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| associated with that and our struggle as mayor and council will be to determine what level of service there is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| You know how we pay for it, but we'll be working with you this year to to have a plan to present this time next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| So I'd answer your question I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| Think I heard mr. Pennington say that for about 10 years it almost doesn't matter and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| depending on the market risk in the defined benefit portion you could have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Bigger or smaller gap depending on whether the pots growing or shrinking, but the early initial phase for new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| Yeah, I mean for the next 10 or 15 years the new employees are a going to be a relatively smaller percentage of population B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| It's going to be a relatively smaller compensation, so the overall liability and contribution impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| Regardless of really the markets. It's just not going to be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| Significant whether you're in a DB plan a DC plan or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| Yeah, I mean if you look at the to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| What the most telling thing is even under the 5% scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| When you looked at that cone that was going out as the line diverged if you're just looking at new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| Even on a relatively poor investment term scenario the lines don't change that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| Because what what happens is over 50 60 70 80 years you get this huge inactive pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| And then you've got all those assets, and then you have a loss there, and that's what blows everything up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Part of the discussion we're having about what we do now when you close an existing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| You don't have like people behind you throwing money in the pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| So does that explain your difficulty going forward in other words you don't have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| People who have already put in plus new dollars going into that pension plan that will be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| Does that affect the divergence? I mean, I'm sorry can you restate the question? I want to make sure I'm answering the right question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| Yeah, in other words as if part of the of the resolution that would be on a ballot would be to a close plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| GC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| And and then adopt some some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Solution for new employees as to the first part of that when you close the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| One of the difficulties you experience is there's no new dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| coming in from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| Employees at least well, yeah, but you have full-time employees. They're still paying in but it's a smaller group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| right I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| To some extent you've just got new employees put their money in and there's contributions for their benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| But you still have this hanging. You know this old plan out there, so I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| I think the answer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| Exacerbate the problem to put a different plan in but it doesn't solve the problem either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| Yeah, I mean ultimately the city's got to put in X million dollars and whether you know the new plan is a B or C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| They still got to put in you know hundred thirty million dollars or whatever over the next several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| I'm going to assume we're ready to move on in to number six, which is a straw poll. I think we've vetted it enough less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4666)|
| 1:17:54| Unless somebody else's has something else that we I don't know what we haven't covered, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| but anyway, I think that it's I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| Think it's time that we do that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| Yeah, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| You know we've heard a lot tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| And I don't know that I've had any kind of Eureka moment in the past few days or you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| We've heard a lot of good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Know something that doesn't get talked about is security working for the government period whether it's uniformed officers general employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| You know I've worked a non-profit blue-collar job for ten years plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| And you know fortunately my wife was smart enough to get me to invest my money smarter years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4713)|
| 1:18:41| And into a plan period I don't know where where we'll end up going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| I don't know if I can make my mind up on a particular straw poll one way or other of the options in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| So I guess that I guess is what I'm saying is since the last straw poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| We took it doesn't sound like you know I'm going one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| So I just again. I wanted to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| That's I guess what I did last time, but tonight. I haven't heard anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Definitive that has changed my mind one way or the other I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| You know there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| One thing that makes it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I guess in a sense is looking at these people in their eyes, and I respect them all very much the employees general government fire police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| We're not detracting from their benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| So we've got to be smart stewards of the city's money and taxpayer dollars going forward new employees, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| you know short of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Putting my two cents in I sit and listen a lot over here, and I don't say a whole lot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| Anyway, I just wanted to throw that out there, and you know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| Honestly the straw poll. I don't know what's getting ready to be put right before us besides choose one a or B, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| That's all I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| I guess I would come back then obviously there are things that are left out there that are not answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| But I mean I you know I would wholeheartedly want to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| That we could walk out here tonight knowing whether or not we're going to support a DC or a hybrid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| I mean because I don't I don't know what else what other rock and we'll keep this discussion going what other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| If you have other concerns or questions, I mean let's get them out here on the table, but you know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| You know we put a lot of work into this, and I don't know where what else we could what else we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| Yeah, and I'll open it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| That's great. So what what you're looking at from from a straw poll standpoint is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| Whether or not not necessarily this is the hybrid plan, but whether or not you want to go hybrid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| Yeah, and I mean and we're this isn't the end of the rope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| But I would hope that we could walk out of here again tonight knowing which way we need to go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| And I you know maybe that's too black and white, but but but I think that's where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| I mean, I think from discretion discussions. We've had particularly the last two meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| You know it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out where I think most of us are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| And I think we're just about there, but but again. I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| Have a concern that you know we haven't answered all your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4882)|
| 1:21:31| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4891)|
| 1:22:01| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4921)|
| 1:22:19| But I'd like to say I mean we're not at the end of the rope, but I think it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| Hey, no at the end of the rope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| That we you know that we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| You know in a positive way either way however the vote comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| I mean we have to all rally behind the decision councillor Wallace. Oh, we've got over. Yeah councilman grave has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4958)|
| 1:22:48| We're we're trying to come up something we're trying to come up with something that we present to the voters correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| So is there anything that says you can't present to the voters that we close the existing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| And then we either decide on a the hybrid plan or a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| Do you have to go either or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4987)|
| 1:23:18| Well, I mean basically I mean if we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| Let's just say that we go with the hybrid plan and the voters voted down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| Then where are we if we go if we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Two plans, I'm just throwing that out. I'm just curious as to what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| Think that we would run the risk of total confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| I'm gonna run the risk of rejection also well, and you could but but my answer to that is if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5021)|
| 1:23:49| Whatever is decided. I'm gonna be a hundred percent behind whatever it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| And I want to urge the people to you know to move or whatever, but I mean we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| Collectively you know we need to make a decision on which way we're going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I just I mean I wouldn't be a proponent of putting two two up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| Is that a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Couple things I want to touch on I've had some conversations with mr. Swanson in the past. I think he's left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5056)|
| 1:24:24| You have to avoid the issue of confusion for the voters and we spoke about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5064)|
| 1:24:32| You know a part a question and then a part B question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| And then if part B only voted was only voted on if there was a certain outcome for part a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| that that could lead to confusion and then ultimately the problem could arise if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| Part a was voted one way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| The part B question was voted another way you couldn't divine the the will of the voters so there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5092)|
| 1:25:00| You know real concern with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Measures that are put on the ballot the way I read the Charter and state law. I have to have a yes or a no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| question of if you like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| Then you get to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| so I'd be very reluctant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Believe that I understand that you're trying to leave options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| But I would be reluctant in the inadvertently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| causing confusion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Another question. Mr. Swanson. I've also discussed it no matter what is put on the ballot if it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5134)|

| 1:25:54| Another two year time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| Something that was originally want to speak about speak about now is a question about what you just said sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| so if it's if it's put on the ballot that we close the existing plan and that that passes and that whatever plan we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5165)|

| 1:26:22| I got it. I think late in the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| So maybe not everybody got to read late in the day like I did or I haven't been able to see it yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| But but Gilbert drafted a couple of questions and the question the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| part of the question addressed closing the current plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| Then effective January 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| The new plan whichever one it was counseled decided on would then go in effect. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| It's my belief and you know, like I said, mr. Swanson, I've talked about it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| The question is defeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| We would continue with the defined benefit plan that is presently in place. Does that answer your question? Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5221)|
| 1:27:10| You're welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Second or the third point that I was wanting to discuss is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| Mr. Swanson I yesterday had a really good conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| Getting whatever council decides with prepared to present to council present to the pension board and more importantly present to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5241)|
| 1:27:30| it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| very labor-intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Apparently quite literally there are only six people in the state of Tennessee that have the expertise to deal with this because there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5257)|
| 1:27:46| serious ramifications of not being in compliance with IRS guidelines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| threatens the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Probably would expose the city to all sorts of liability that nobody. I'm certain of would be interested in so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| You know at some point I would respectfully submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| This council needs to say we like a or we like B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| So the people who have to prepare this have an adequate amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| Where they're not bumping up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| Deadlines to get something to the pension board to review and then have time to you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| Accurately reflect and consult all federal tax laws and IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| Guidelines, I mean, you know, there's the joke about you know, we started with Ten Commandments and then Congress got involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| Well, I mean it's a joke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| But it's also it's a very serious reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| That those people who are putting the pension plan together and the pension board have to consider so I'd respectfully submit if it's not tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| you know council needs to give some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Direction so the people who are putting pen to paper and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| Sweating this out through their brow have adequate time to prepare a good solid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5339)|
| 1:29:09| Yeah, well right now we were trying to get this to the pension board on June the 12th, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| You can actually deliver it as late as the 21st. The pension board meets on the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| The pension board simply has to receive it. That's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| They can opine on it, but it's up to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| We're t-minus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| We're t-minus 34 days if we're trying to get it to them on the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| So, I mean and I think a good part of what we've got to do next is we've got to move into the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| Real nuts and bolts of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| So, I mean we we really don't have a lot more time to sit here and discuss a or B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| We've got to make a decision and if we're gonna go either one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Then we've got to really get into the nuts and bolts of either one of the two plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| And that was my whole point. I mean, we've got other workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| We've got to decide and move forward tonight on one of those so we can get to the nuts and bolts of it, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| Thank you. You stated it better than I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| What he's saying is the nuts and bolts include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| discussions about retirement age the wage amount if you're gonna have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Hybrid plan that you put in the defined benefit the COLA control and the percentage of that you match or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5420)|

| 1:30:28| And I think that's you know, we got to make sure it's you know, I throw out ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| I mean, I have a lot of ideas. Not all of them are good. I don't know which ones are good or bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| That's what you lawyers come up with. I just make the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| Councilman Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| At what point well it again we would have to go through you know, we would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| Define exactly what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| We want to give to the six folks in the state of Tennessee that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| Draft it and it would have to go back to the pension board and then it would come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| You know, I mean, I don't know exactly what that I mean, that's the chronological order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| I don't know exactly what that time frame is. And I don't know if dr. Lyons if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| Is there a drop? I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| Don't know that that we've arrived at a final procedure such as vice mayor palace discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| But for certain it has to come back from the pension board and then be voted on by council prior to be putting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| The ballot on two readings. So that is certain now whether you want to have a rough resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| I guess you could have a resolution sending one to the pension board. I don't know that that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| I've heard that they're mixed feelings on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| But that obviously is a vote another vote that would be more formal that would send it on to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| Could I say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Attorney Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Whenever whatever we get on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Hopefully, I know you have to have it in legal terms and legal definitions that is written in a way that lay people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| Can understand it because when I work in the elections, I saw many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| Who would leave and say what I just didn't vote because I didn't understand but I know we have to have it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| Legal terms, but I will hope that we can have it as plain as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| Councilman Greene says keep it simple as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| plain as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| Councilman Starr did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| What I just thought it made sense to vote to have a resolution to send it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| To the pension board that way we can have some feeling that it would pass when it comes back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you. I agree with Councilman Starr finally on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| But I would feel much better and I think it makes it a cleaner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| Operation if we do have a resolution that we do send to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| Obviously, the problem is what is that resolution going to say? And so may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| Ask the permission of council to ask councilman camp in a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5585)|
| 1:33:12| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| Councilman Campin if you're not prepared to do is I could make a commitment tonight on one of these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| Could you be prepared to make a commitment on Tuesday night at the regular council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| I'm not pressuring you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| I also know that we could spend the rest of our lives on this and be all up for re-election and still not have a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5612)|
| 1:33:40| Well, yeah, I I think I can in a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| No, no, no Tuesday night. It is a week from tonight. Yes a week from tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5624)|

| 1:34:02| Well, I really don't care what he thinks I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Well, we're not say that nicely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Okay, if we could go ahead with a straw poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Yeah, and then maybe that might encourage him to take one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Thank you, and I want to go to that and we won't twist arms afterwards. We will let you know more so than tonight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| And we're not we're not talking the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5661)|

| 1:36:10| Sets of wording and I guess the question I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| Do the voters have to have it spelled out in total or can we use the phrase hybrid plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| To give more flexibility in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| Crafting the plan. I believe the word hybrid can be used but that's based on attorney Gilbert's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5786)|

| 1:37:14| I've got to know what the hybrid plan is. Sure. And so we're talking about the nuts and bolts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| I mean, are we are we gonna retire at 62 or 65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5838)|

| 1:37:27| Board and so I think we have to do the nuts and bolts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| I mean, I don't want to go to the I don't want to go and just say well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Are you for the hybrid plan and not know what the hybrid plan is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| No, I agree with that. I mean I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| I'm here. We're going to a nuts and bolts. Okay, so I'm hearing that a resolution would be probably premature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| More workshops. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Yeah, and we'll do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| And some are half units, but I didn't mean to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Just just to let you know, I will be unavailable from the 19th to the end of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| I'm available to you between now and the 18th to do anything that you like and I've got other support staff that can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5886)|

| 1:38:18| We will go to public form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5898)|
| 1:38:39| Members of council, my name is Scott coffee 72 12. I'll be in line Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| I've come before you tonight after coming to obviously all of these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| Most of you I never for a number of years. I was the vice president the FOP for approximately eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| One of my jobs there was the pay and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| Pretty much we were the cause of the Mercer study. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Dr. Hatfield every year civil service performed the annual salary survey. They came up with the results of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| Essentially what I did to bring it before council and to let you know, I'm no expert in math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| My my grades in college in high school can obviously attest to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| So just to let you know where where we're coming from. It was fairly simplistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| We had roughly if I remember right nine ranks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Roughly if I remember right nine ranks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| What I generally did was I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| The average that all those ranks were consistently underpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| I had him together and said by and large the members of the Knoxville Police Department are this far below average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| During the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| 2007 year the budget mayor Haslam said, you know, I'm not sure that that that that survey is accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| He said I want to get him more outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Look at it. So which dr. Hatfield was I don't think overly ecstatic about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=5996)|
| 1:40:05| However, they did that and we hired Mercer which was a very competent company and did a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| The exception of the benefits were put together in one lump sum, which I don't believe is quite accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| However, the pay came up to be exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Within a very small margin of what dr. Hatfield said it came up to be underpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6018)|
| 1:40:26| So the reason I bring all this up reason I'm bringing this up is if you go to a defined contribution plan, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6026)|
| 1:40:33| You're going to have to at least meet the 50th percentile and pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| All right. The only thing that saved the city of Knoxville during that survey from an incredibly reputable company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| Was the fact that we had an extraordinarily good pension and while it has a high percentage rate of retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| That percentage rate is not nearly as good as if you were make making the pay of the 50th percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| If I was making $60,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Okay, what I'm what I'm trying to say is if I'm making $60,000 if I get 75% of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| You know, okay, that's nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| But if I'm in Nashville and I'm making $75,000 and I'm getting 50,000 of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| Your numbers are going to come out to be the same that's the point I'm trying to convey to you. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| I've heard the $24,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| In brought up as far as the hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| $24,000 is barely above according to the US census the poverty level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| I realize the pensions got to be changed and I understand that and I've looked at the budget for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| Take that into consideration if you go to a defined contribution whether you like it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| The county got away from the defined contributions plan and whether you like that plan or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| And whether you agree with it or not, there was a reason they did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| Because most people on that defined contribution did not retire until they could collect Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| My age right now. I can collect Social Security at 67 and I've been here six 17 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| There shouldn't be 67 year old policemen working on the street out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| My life the life of these other policemen and the life of you all citizens depend on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| Not to mention the fact that the city's gonna be paying out a significant amount when these people are just dying at their desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| We don't have the pension problems that other places have all right, the sky's not falling here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| Nashville officers, they're paying nothing into the pension. They're not altering their pension. They're getting a 6% raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| They do and I will say this could a smaller percentage. However, they're paying more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| So what I'm seeing here is is Chief Roush and a multitude of other people have told you that it costs $100,000 training officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6165)|
| 1:42:53| And while I agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| I think it costs even more because I think for the first five years that you work here as a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| You're still learning and you're still in training. You're paying that officer and I'm gonna go with the baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| $32,000 a year. It's $32,000 a year plus benefits for the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| There's not a minute 30 seconds not to mention that hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| I think you need to think long and hard about the hybrid thing that the mayor's proposed to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| Because they're gonna lose a lot of good employees to various surrounding areas. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| Tony Willis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| Good evening, Tony Willis one zero seven three Bartlett Drive, Jefferson City, and I wanted to start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| Giving you my thanks to council. God has heard your prayers and the cubs are no longer in last place by themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| The Brewers have joined them. So thank you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| Couple of things. Um, I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I was a little disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| Tonight I wasn't here at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| Tonight I wasn't here at the last session, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| Think it appears that it feels as if some of the rhetoric went a little bit backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| And I hear everybody saying that they well appreciate the employee and I believe that I believe you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| However, I don't know that there's a full understanding at what's at stake when employees hit the streets and their various capacities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6252)|
| 1:44:21| When we work Rose any fest this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Had a comment from a retired or soon-to-be retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| Central Florida officer who was downtown for the festival and he said this is amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| There is nothing like this in Central, Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| And I intend to move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Because of the way that this is and he specifically mentioned mentioned and I meant to pass it along to Alex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| the cleanliness of downtown and the number of police and how safe and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| What an eclectic environment it was and he tends to move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| We are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| We are different and I thought that was well established, but I want to repeat it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| We are the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| comparing us to cities such as and I respectfully submit and I appreciate the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| Councilman stair did and trying to get some comparisons here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| But we're not Murphysboro. We're not Johnson City this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| This town is the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| When you go to training in law enforcement across the country, they know about Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| Those other cities don't get mentioned. It is not surprising that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| They have 1,500 applicants in this economic environment for a handful of positions. I assure you they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6331)|
| 1:45:39| 1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| Credible candidates, they don't have 1,500 qualified candidates. That's simply not the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| Again we are talking about a legacy vote in a direction we go. We're talking about an impact a decade or two down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| We have talked about this problem being an inherent one for this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| Much like that in 10 or 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| There will be discussions about the decision that this council makes on how we deal with this pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6363)|
| 1:46:10| It is terribly terribly impactful on future employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| The issue is already settled it appears for current employees. So why are we still here? Why are we interested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6374)|
| 1:46:22| it is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| it is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Future employees will take the same risk that we do. We have an obligation responsibility to lend them a voice today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| That they don't have and that's why we are continuing to come back and put this issue in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| We've had some rhetoric throughout the workshops of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| the pension changes the current pension being on the backs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| Taxpayers, and I don't think that's fair rhetoric to say it in that term any more than it is to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| that creating a new park or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| Whatever new amenity for the public is on the backs of taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120508?start=6421)|
