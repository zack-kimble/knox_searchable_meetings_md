| 2:50:23| I'm not Thomas Carpenter, Commissioner Wright, but I'm going to represent him tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10223)|
| 2:50:29| I just bought this property from him two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| I've been trying to buy it for about eight or ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10232)|
| 2:50:35| because I own another piece of property that joins this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10235)|
| 2:50:38| but I had called MPC today plus trying to get an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10238)|
| 2:50:43| about how do I make another application under my name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| and I was told by MPC just make sure I show up here tonight if I'm on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10249)|
| 2:50:56| So I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| This piece of property is on the agenda and you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| That answers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10263)|
| 2:51:04| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| Mr. Hibben, this has two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10272)|
| 2:51:22| One is to improve the Twin Oak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10282)|
| 2:51:28| The other is because it's inside the parental responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| you must provide sidewalk connection to the immediately adjacent Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10294)|
| 2:51:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10303)|
| 2:51:44| One thing I would like to ask you for is if it is at all possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| with other adjacent property owners north toward the Gibbs Ruitan Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10309)|
| 2:51:56| if you would consider, if other property owners are in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| to maybe have a walking trail between the Ruitan Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| using this access on into the Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| Are you agreeable to that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| Commissioner Wright, I would certainly be in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10331)|
| 2:52:17| I would make a motion that the recommendation be approved for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10337)|
| 2:52:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10344)|

| 2:52:36| Make sure with Daniel, are we good to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| I'm looking on KGIS and Mr. Carpenter is still the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| Are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| Are we good on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10363)|
| 2:52:44| I mean, I'm good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10364)|
| 2:52:45| I just want to make sure that we're, Mr. Kelly, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10365)|

| 2:53:21| Is there any other action to come before this meeting of the Knox County zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10401)|
| 2:53:28| We didn't vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| We didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10410)|

| 2:53:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10420)|
| 2:53:46| We did not have a chance for any discussion after the commission meeting a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10426)|
| 2:53:51| Did anyone, this is, if there be no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10431)|
| 2:53:56| did anyone have any announcements or anything that they'd like to bring before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10436)|
| 2:54:03| I would like Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| Yeah, I just wanted to make a quick comment on the senior picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| I thought it was great that the different organizations volunteered their time to help out the senior services staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10450)|
| 2:54:17| I noticed there was about 20 individuals from the Walgreens Corporation that volunteered their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10457)|
| 2:54:23| and there was also some young ladies from a church, but maybe one of you will remember who that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10463)|

| 2:54:33| The Latter Day Saints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| And I thought that was terrific that they volunteered their time to help out the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| and I thought that event went off very well despite the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| Let me hurriedly make two or three announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10483)|

| 2:55:38| The Midway Road discussion is to occur the 8th at 630 at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150928?start=10538)|
