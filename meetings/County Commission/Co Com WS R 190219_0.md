| 0:00:30| Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| And thank you to all of our guests who are joining us at this work session for the February Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=38)|
| 0:00:46| Before we begin tonight, I will invite Commissioner Bussler to join us in a pledge to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=46)|
| 0:00:53| After that, we will call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| Chairman, before we start, I would like to recite a little thing that I learned to go along with the Pledge of Allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| to give a little bit more emphasis while we do the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| It begins with, I believe in the United States as a government for the people, by the people, of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| A democracy and a republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| A government of a sovereign United States, sovereign states, and derived upon the principles of freedom, justice, liberty, and humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=77)|
| 0:01:35| Saying this, it says, I also believe it is my duty to love my country, to support its constitution, obey its laws, and honor its flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=95)|
| 0:01:47| I therefore now ask you to stand and honor our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=107)|
| 0:01:56| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=116)|
| 0:02:14| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=134)|

| 0:02:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=150)|

| 0:02:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=152)|

| 0:02:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=154)|

| 0:02:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you, and I am aware that both Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Daly both are sick, so please keep them in your prayers and hope that they get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| So that is why they are not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| We have not just pulled a no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| We are aware that both of them were sick, so let's hope that if they are watching on TV, I hope both of you all get better soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| So, okay, moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| And for those of you who this might be your first time meeting, our guests or to our folks at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| the way County Commission works every month is tonight's meeting is considered a work session, which we review our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| We'll discuss and debate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| We will take some items and put them forward as part of a consent agenda where we will vote on all of them at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| So tonight there will be a lot of discussion as we're truly formulating the formal meeting next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| where we will be doing the actual votes that count on so many of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| So with that said, at every County Commission meeting we have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| and I have two folks who have signed up for public forum who both work for our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| and I'm going to call on Daris Upton, our diversity development manager, to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| So thank you, Daris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| And Daris, please do formally state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| Using my accessible podium here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| My name is Daris Upton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| I live at 202 Tuscaloosa Drive, which is actually in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Don't hold that against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| But I was brought to this staff with Mayor Jacobs to be diversity development manager, and that means so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=260)|
| 0:04:30| Diversity encompasses so many different groups and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| Essentially, it's a lot of folks that we have maybe not thought about and left behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| and that's kind of my job is to think about all those groups and individuals of people that we haven't thought about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| So what does that mean, and what have we done so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Simple things like changing our vendor application to reflect a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| that you can identify yourself as a veteran or service-disabled veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| This is especially important since we have veterans' preference here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| Changing our business license application to collect diversity information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| so we know who is actually signing up to be our business owners here and leaders in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| so then we can network as a county to purchase goods and services from those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| We hosted a small business forum in November just to get more ideas from our local business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| to understand some of the problems and issues that they faced in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| and how we can do a better job moving forward to engage our minority business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| Now, when you think about diversity, that also includes some folks with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| people like me who are disabled veterans, and we have to think about how we engage them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| And with that in mind, with the help of Cindy Pionke and the city's ADA coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| we put on an awareness training session back in February that was open for everybody who works in our city-county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=358)|
| 0:06:06| so that they could understand more about how to interact with folks with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| and how we could understand more about what those needs are from that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| And we are planning right now for the month of March a diversity business expo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| Now, this is an opportunity for our departments to interact with our minority business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| whether African American, Hispanic, folks with disabilities, veterans, all of those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| to come in, to sit down and talk to our department heads, learn more about opportunities to interact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| to network, to do business together, because quite frankly, looking at our own data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| we haven't done a good job of that in the past, and we need to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| And our mayor is determined to do better, and we are determined to support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| And that also means supporting our community in other ways we haven't thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| So this summer, we are happy to announce that we are hosting 10 interns from Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| to be part of our various departments to learn and see what we do as Knox County on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Giving these young folks an opportunity to know more that it's not just sitting here in a pretty building all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| What we're working on continually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Things like working with the KCDCA authority, excuse me, our public housing authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| and Volunteers of America to address veteran homelessness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| How do we meet that challenge? What can we do? What models can we use to be successful in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| And finding solutions to introduce things like computer science to young folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| who don't have that in their curriculum at their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| but it is important that they know about that opportunity as a way to become successful in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| Programs like C-SPIRE and their software development pathway in Water Valley, Mississippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| are examples that we can pull from and use here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Overall, our goal is just to continue to make sure that as Knox County moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| that we include everyone at that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| That everyone has the same opportunities that maybe they didn't have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| And that's what diversity development really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| So I thank you tonight, and I appreciate any and all support that all of you can give me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Thank you. Do you have any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you for coming and informing us of what you're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| and some of the initiatives that you're most passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Just a quick question about will you both inform this body or include some of the metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| and some of the goals and some of the objectives in an annual report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| How will you best both inform the Commission and the public about milestones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| or things that you're accomplishing along the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I think right now when we look at things, right now the best way to do that is probably like an annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| meeting with our department leaders on a regular basis to see where things are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| and then compiling that and reporting back to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| As a new department, I think it just would be helpful to keep us informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| of what's working, what's not, what are you finding along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| and certainly ways that you're moving the ball along the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Darius, thank you for that hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| I know it's very important, and I'm personally and professionally grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| that we're investing in the work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| It's very important, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| And thank you, Mayor Jacobs, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Before I move on to our next speaker, I wanted to recognize, first of all, Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| We've got two of your staff here speaking at a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| I appreciate you giving us an opportunity and the public to find out some of the things that they're working on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| I notice I see Sheriff Tom Spangler in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Sheriff, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| We've also got our circuit court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| I saw Charlie Susano earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| He appears to be hiding in the back right next to Nick McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| So thank you all for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| I also saw our school superintendent, Bob Thomas, was here back in his corner back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| And a special guest is Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| I really want to take a, if everybody could really take a second to look and thank Terri for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| Terri has been in Nashville this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Most of the members of our school board are still in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| She made a trip back from Nashville early specifically to join us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Prior to this meeting, we had a chairman's briefing where we reviewed our county's balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| And Chairwoman Hill joined us to participate in that session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=653)|

| 0:11:01| And we're glad that you made that extra effort to join us at the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| And thank you for sitting in on tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Now, moving on on our agenda, we also have Roger Cain for public forum, the educational liaison from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=670)|
| 0:11:22| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Since September the 1st, work has been furious and fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| I see my position as an advocate for better educational practices in both public and private school settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| and as a facilitator of various groups and businesses who want to see Knox County schools and education in general improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| I visited 18 high schools and 37 elementary schools since September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| and these visits have been helpful to determine what is working and what needs assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| On many of these tours, school board members and I have met with principals and staff to get a state of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| Where are they now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| How do we get them to where they need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| And how can we at the mayor's office help them to connect with resources and programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| I've also inquired into how the mayor's office can be of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| For example, at West High School, while touring a CTE program, I'm speaking to a teacher who is teaching cybersecurity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| I was able to connect him with two cybersecurity companies out of the Oak Ridge area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| who were sending their staff members to his classroom to help improve his program at their own expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| We've also met with several student groups at local high schools to determine the state of Career Technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and what they're interested in learning through Career Tech and what resources are still needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Since reading is another major focus of the mayor, I've been meeting with numerous organizations and program directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| to try to develop best practices on how to improve Knox County's reading scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Each school board member was given their district's reading results for the last five years for perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| and ideas have been bounced around on how to improve these results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| I've also met with Janet Sexton, who is in the year-round reading program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| and met with the University of Tennessee's School of Education directors to elicit their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| While meeting with Johnson University, we've asked them to help by bringing attention to the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| that their teacher ed students could be also helping in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| To date, I've delivered 37 cards from various parts of the county of citizens through the Great School Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| who want to help children read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| These citizen helpers come from visits to our senior centers, veterans' breakfasts, and church speaking engagements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| that have listened to a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| I typically have an easel board, I have a copy of it down here, that shows the Knox County reading scores by each elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| I also attend many seminars to help better understand programs currently being used or in consideration for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| programs like Restorative Justice, community schools, a seminar on ACEs, which is Adverse Childhood Experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| KnoxWorks, and board meetings with the Greater School Partnership to understand the plethora of programs that they offer for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| I also serve as a facilitator coordinator for several groups meeting to assist Knox County to develop the resources and programs not currently available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| I'm on the Dyslexia Coalition Board, the TCAT Board, the Greater School Partnership Board, and Partners in Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| I also brought the USDA to visit with Russ Oaks and others to help develop resources to have access to federal funding that we have not previously looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=854)|
| 0:14:25| I've also met with two foundations about funding programs at two schools that were not currently on the school board budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=865)|
| 0:14:34| but that the community and the principal felt passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| I've also toured our Tennessee School for the Deaf and am currently working for a program with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| and also working with Mary Palm and the Friends of the Library to help develop a summer reading program to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon Flight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| I brought the state's resources to help our newest school board members and county commissioners better understand the BEP formula at a workshop most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| Also, I've invited Governor Lee to take a tour of one of our local high schools to get a good view of what we need to make Tennessee a top-notch state in career technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=897)|
| 0:15:07| My involvement in Partners in Education just recently helped Knox County host a career day showcase for 8th graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| and later in April we are working to host a trade show for high schoolers with BXTN and the University School of Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| to help show children the amazing careers available to them through the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Success in education, though, can be sometimes elusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| My goal first and foremost is to improve the reading abilities of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| While reading is one facet, it is incredibly crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Children who cannot read face a life of educational frustration, employment uncertainty, crime, and incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| I was surprised last year to learn that although Tennessee has a law against promoting children who are not academically ready to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| 44 counties did not retain a single child in our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| This is unconscionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| These children are not ignorant, they are simply missing a vital skill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Efforts have to be made to address these issues in Knox County, but also more can always be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| As for measurable metrics, I am working with our local partners to ensure dollars spent result in marked improvement in our achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| I am looking to bring state and federal dollars down to help assist our local schools, colleges, and universities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| to improve and increase the number of offerings for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| I have explained to school administration, school board members, and numerous principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| the freedoms the state gives local authorities to enact change, especially in some of our most failing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| I have offered assistance to connect people with other programs and resources to ensure that we do not remain at status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| I have coordinated tours of counties near us who are taking education in a different direction and are actually getting results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| I will also follow up with members to see what directions and programs they would like to see in the 2019-2020 school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| and how we can help to achieve those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Since community involvement is paramount to our success in any education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| I would like to coordinate and develop a listening tour to see what the community needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| and how the community intends to participate in the educational landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Thank you, Roger. We appreciate that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| That was an awful lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| If you have a copy of that, that would probably be helpful as a follow-up for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| I will be glad to email it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Great. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Any questions? Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Mr. Cain, how would you define your relationship with the elected members of the Knox County School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| and what types of engagement steps do you take to productively work together with our school members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| Well, I am currently in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| I have met with all of our school board members privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| gave them their reading results as far as the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| so they could get a perspective of where we are and where we're going and where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| While on tour of these schools, the elementary schools particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| school board members with us or with me and the principal, like I said in my message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| we have good relationships with our school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Part of my job is to bring what I learned from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| what I learned as a teacher myself, what I learned as a parent of four children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| who have been in private school, Christian school, public school, and Montessori school to the full front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| and say, look, this is okay, but we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| All right. Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Did you say you had some kind of poster that had the reading scores on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| Was that something that you wanted to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Every group has a different process and procedure of how they like visual aids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| I'll be glad to email each of you the educational reading results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| To me, that's an incredible metric of where we are and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| Just so you know, currently we have 52 elementary schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Twenty-nine of them are below the state average of 34% reading proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| So as you look at these numbers, you're going to be kind of surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| where we are and where we still need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| That would be great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Okay. Seeing no other questions, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| All right. For the public and my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| this is the part of our agenda where we actually set the agenda for tonight's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| and also the items that will be carried forward on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| So I'm going to read out the items that are not going to be on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| These are items I posted to the commissioner's forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I've also heard from a few other commissioners about other items that we're going to be adding to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| First of all, our non-consent items will be item 5, 7, 16, 20, 22, 35, 36, 43, 50, 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1191)|
| 0:20:19| I do have a few here I'm going to have to pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| All right. That was 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1221)|
| 0:20:34| I am going to go back and make a couple of modifications real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Commissioner Biggs requested item 21 and 41, and Commissioner Gill requested item 12, 14, and 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| Now, that was our original list. I do have three items that we need to pull from our consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| Excuse me. Could you go back over those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Sure. Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| No, no, no. Just the ones since you sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Okay. Items on the forum, Commissioner Biggs added item 21 and 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| Commissioner Gill added on the forum item 12, 14, and 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| Now, we also have a few others that we found out tonight that for different reasons we need to pull from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| Those were items 46, so that was one of our original items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1281)|
| 0:21:30| Item 19 and 40, I think when I did the original list, those were items that were on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| and we're going to be pulling each one of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Either they, some of which will be sent forward with no, I think the proper on 46, 19, and 40 will be sent forward with no recommendation when we get to them on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1300)|
| 0:21:54| Items that need to be added to our agenda would be item number 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1314)|
| 0:22:03| Additionally, as posted on the Commissioner's forum, Commissioner Biggs brought to my attention an item we'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| I will ask him to bring up for commission as it relates to collecting business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| So, I'm going to ask the county clerk to add an item when we get to it related to Commissioner Biggs and collecting business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1338)|
| 0:22:27| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| As a discussion item, not an item to revote, but as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Yes, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Number 58, the presentation of emergency services study by CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Kevin is out of town and he's scheduled to be here Monday, and he'll be driving back to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| so if we could move that as far to the front, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| It's a 10 or 15, maybe 20 minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| For tonight or for next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1371)|

| 0:22:54| Okay, so item 58 Monday early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| Also, item 57 is one discussion item that will not be led by a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| We're going to move item 57 to the front of the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1395)|

| 0:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| So, 61 we will pull and move to Monday for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1419)|

| 0:23:51| so can we just defer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| The request remains to move it up in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So the request remains to move it up to agenda but have the discussion next week to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| I want to make sure my clerk has got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| That was from the health department, so we will not move up on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| We will work on that to get early next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1450)|

| 0:24:16| I think I was asked to defer until next Monday item 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| Yes, and to clarify, item 59 was the AMR discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| The representative from AMR is not here tonight but clarified with me that he'll be available next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| so we'll be moving that item to next week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1470)|

| 0:27:48| We appreciate this group being founded, and I thought the public would want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Cindy Pionke, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| The group is going to be interested in looking at the transition plan that is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Some of you may have heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| It's the ADA transition plan, which is required that the county have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| At this point in time, the consultant is working on an amended contract, but the initial work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| that they did identified over $73 million worth of improvements that the county needs to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| This coming July will be the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| and essentially we're trying to we're way behind on getting caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And as part of that work, they've identified over $27 million worth of projects that they consider to be high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1717)|
| 0:28:46| Obviously, we're not going to be able to fund everything in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| so this is a 40-year plan in terms of getting this implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| And because we have so many high-priority projects, what the Dagwood group will be doing is helping to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| to find out what they consider to be the really top priorities that we need to attack first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| That's a big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| It is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Yeah, Cindy, thanks for bringing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| So you said it's a 40-year plan with a $74 million price tag currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Currently, and that's going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| So why do we have a, I guess, we have a 40-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| The rules are going to change 40 times in a 40-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Why do we plan out that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| And is it because it's a funding discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| It's a funding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| That's why we're going out that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| A lot of places that already have their plans in place, it's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| It's not unusual for them to have a 30-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Forty years was what, in talking with Chris Caldwell, our finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| seemed to be reasonable in terms of what we could actually achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| So that's just based on today's budget and current dollars that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| It's going to take us 40 years to come compliant with ADA regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I'm seeing Mr. Caldwell approaching the podium if you'd like some extra insight on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Just so you know, we're planning on doing that with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| That's opposed to bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| That makes it a 140-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Mark, did you have anything else you wanted to add on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| That motion is seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Item number 12 is a resolution approving a subcontract with West End for external evaluator services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| with a value up to $899,307 for a term of 60 months beginning November 1st, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| It's funded through the United States Department of Education, Education Investment and Research Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Resolution 205.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Motion for approval has been made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Discussion item on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I know that Commissioner Gill asked to pull this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| She's not at the meeting, but I'm sure she's probably watching from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So, you know, one of her questions that she posted on the forum, and I'll ask John or Bob can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| just provide number one some general insight to this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| and then a more specific question was the purpose of a five-year STEM evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| the schools that were involved, and the grade level involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| So if you could provide some of that additional insight, we'd appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and I know Commissioner Gill from home would appreciate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Laura Denton, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I may ask you to repeat some of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| So to start with, the schools in year one will be Ball Camp, Bell Morris, Cedar Bluff, Green Magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| and Mount Olive Elementary Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| The five-year length of time is because this is a U.S. Department of Education grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| You all approved it back in November, as does our board, and the grant period is five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and so that's why the need for the evaluation to last the length of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Can you repeat the rest of the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Grade levels, what grade levels is this impacting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| So we'll start in year one with fifth graders only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| In year two, which will be the next school year, we'll look at third through fifth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| at each of those five schools, and we'll also add another five schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| So we'll be at ten schools in year two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| And I guess more specifically, one of the questions was the purpose of a five-year STEM evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| Does that question make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| So the purpose of the evaluation, many of the large-scale federal grants require an external evaluator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| to give an unbiased opinion on whether or not the intervention works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| So WestEd and the evaluators assigned to the project will look at things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| are these kids more successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Do they learn more than kids who aren't involved in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| And very specific indicators of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| And at the end of five years, hopefully we will know whether or not this amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and this programming was successful and if it's something that should be replicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you for your insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Page 3, item number 14, is a resolution approving amended allocations to the fiscal year 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| budgets for Title I, Title I Neglecting and Delinquent, Title II, and Title III funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| in the amount of $20,251,070.02, resolution 207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| So a motion for approval has been made by Commissioner Smith and a second has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I think that one was pulled by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| I guess we'd like more general information on that particular item, specifically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| schools that are going to be impacted by that particular grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| Cheryl Martin, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| So the $20 million that you see is actually the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Can you pull the microphone closer to you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| So our original budget was approved in September, and then the $20 million that you see on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| is including the carryover that was determined at the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| And so the schools that are affected, we have 31 Title I schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| We have two neglected facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We have two delinquent facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And then the Title II funds serve professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| It funds coaches, instructional coaches, and RTI coaches for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Is there any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Item number 15 is a resolution approving an amended allocation to the fiscal year 2019 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| for Title IV funds in the amount of $1,287,821.35, resolution 208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| The proper motion is before us from Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| So as part of discussion, if someone from the school team would provide, should have had you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| but could provide additional insight to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Melissa Drennan, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| So Title IV is those dollars we utilize for the instructional supplies to go through for AP and IB application fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2153)|
| 0:36:04| We also have a portion of those dollars that have to be spent for private schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| and they do things around some of the same initiatives that we're doing in the school district around positive behavior support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| restorative practices, and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| A large portion that you'll see under contracted services, we started in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| and we've been adding up until this month a mental health counselor from Helen Ross McNabb to all of our middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| and high schools, so that's been something that we've been really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| And then the rest of that is just an indirect cost in all of the other French benefits that go with employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Is there any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Yeah, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Did I hear you say for private schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| All the federal grants have a proportionate share that have to be given to the private schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| and we oversee the same thing for Title, IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| Any of the federal grants have a proportionate share that goes towards the private schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| and so we manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We meet with them and collaborate on what kinds of things that they want to spend that money on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and then we make those purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| How many private schools here in Knox County do we have participating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Is it all of them or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Well, any of them that choose, we have to send out the information to the private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| There are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| I don't have the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| I can certainly get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Item number 16 is a resolution approving amended allocations to fiscal year 2019 budgets for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| I-DEA Part B and I-DEA preschool funds in the amount of $16,099,487.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| This is resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders with a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| For discussion, I was the one who actually pulled this item whenever I see a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| it that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| I always think it's important from a transparency point of view just to share a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| insight to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| So if you don't mind approaching the podium again, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| For this budget, this is our federal I-DEA dollars, and just like the title budget, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| approved our original amount in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| We have our carryover dollars, which are generated from fiscal year 2018 that would have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| The majority of this budget is all in personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| We have over 400 TAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| We've got a small handful of teachers, some supervisory staff, some specialists in autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| behavior specialists, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| There's a smaller amount in materials and supplies because we sometimes, all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| children have access to the general education program, and many times they might need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| additional materials to help provide some additional instruction or supplement what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| they're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| You'll also see some equipment money because we have specialized equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Anything that a student that's, every student with a disability is a general education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| student first, and so anything that we purchase out of the general purpose fund, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| required to buy that for our students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| All of our federal dollars, just like Title I, can only be used to supplement the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| So, for example, if a school buys computers, the special ed dollars may be used to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| the equipment that would allow access, so special switches or any kind of additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| If you have a student that uses an eye gaze, et cetera, we would be able to buy that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| of these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Is there any other additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| This motion is promptly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Item number 19 is a resolution approving a grant contract with the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| of Human Services for Title IV-D Child Support Enforcement Services, which amendment increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| the maximum liability of the state under the grant by $242,946.46, increases the local match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2416)|
| 0:40:25| requirement by $125,154.23, and extends the term of the contract by one year to expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| June 30, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| This is Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Motion approved by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2443)|

| 0:41:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| I called 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I was looking for one, but I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Was that the one with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Y'all don't mind if I lower this, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| I'm tired of the mayor coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| We won't talk about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| I'm going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| I think we received a motion for – to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I'd like to get a – the chair will entertain a substitute motion on 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| I can change my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Or you can change your motion to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Consent with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Consent with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| That would be the proper thing on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| So, thank you, Madam Clerk, for keeping us straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| So –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| On 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| That would be on item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| The discussion is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| We just wanted to make sure we had it set for the Roberts rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Go ahead, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Are you ready for 20 or –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| We're ready for 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| This is 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| That's just going to continue – or that grant is going to let us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| obviously, as it says with the Tennessee Department of Human Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| child support enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| It gives us just a little bit more advantage, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| which I think that we need, and obviously to help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| So, that's why we're on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| And I think it does nothing but benefit us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| but it also benefits more of the public out there that needs that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Is it funded in the current or next budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Yes, it is because it increases us up to $120,000, $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Just to clarify, Commissioner Anders changed his motion to send forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| So, that – go ahead, Commissioner Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And the reason we're doing this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| I think we were wanting to get a copy of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| We're just waiting on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| It's not here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| It was just needed to get the updated contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| So, we'll approve it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Sorry, you were reaching for your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| You need to second to approve his change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Are you good with his change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| This motion to send forward with no recommendation to next week's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Page 4, item number 20 is a resolution approving a three-year grant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| in the amount not to exceed $249,999.83333 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| with the State of Tennessee Department of Correction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| for the purpose of expanding the existing officer reentry program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| This is resolution 302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Commissioner Smith with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| What this is is a contract that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Actually, it was a bid that went out to four different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| or across the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| They awarded it to four agencies, obviously, we being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| There's no match for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| This is a grant for $250,000, right at $250,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| which comes out to about $83,000, $84,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| And what it does is allows us to work with the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| of trying to get them acclimated before they go back out into society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| to reduce that recidivism that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| So what an obvious and great opportunity for us to jump onto that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Is there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Item 21 is a resolution approving a contract with Summit Helicopter Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| for helicopter parts and services for the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| This is resolution 303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| The motion for approval has been made by Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Sheriff, I had a couple of questions, actually, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Number one being this is just a contract for us to do business with Summit Helicopter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| but we've done business with them for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Do you know how many years and how much money we've spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| And also, do you know the ages on the helicopters by any chance, how they're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| Is it going to be more costs every year if they're kind of aged helicopters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Knowing anything about aviation, as long as you keep up with the timed parts on that aircraft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| they'll fly for as long as you want them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| They all range from 71 to 72 models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| That company, Summit, we've done business with them for the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| Over the past year, it's been about, or at least through that contract over the five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| we've spent approximately $150,000 with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| So it's not something that's going to occur all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| It could be less than that and very seldom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| I don't think it's ever gone over the $150,000, at least from what I've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| and what I've been associated with that unit for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| Do we have any grants or anything like that on the helicopters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| Not at this time, but we continue to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Anything and everything that I can get with aviation, I'm looking at daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| or at least I have our people looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So, yeah, it's something we continue to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I certainly want to continue that program because I think it's an asset to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| and anything that I can do to help save money with this county, I'm going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Do we currently have a drone program where we use drones instead of helicopters in specific areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| I know Nashville and stuff like that does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| I didn't know if that would be more cost-saving measures instead of drones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Nashville still has their aviation unit, but, yes, we do have some drones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| The drones can be used in certain circumstances, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| but they can't replace the helicopter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| They can't replace being involved in pursuits or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| and other things that they can't do because you can't go but a certain distance from that module and that operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| So it does limit it some, but they are a very useful tool, and we're using those at times when we can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| All right, thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Mr. Skinmaker, you've also got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| How many active helicopters do we have today in service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Active, there's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| There may be five, but I want to say that there's four active anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Are there any other questions or discussion points on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Item number 22 is a resolution approving a procreation in the amount of $250,000 from revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| from the benefit of Knox County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| is a one-time additional development payment from Securities Technologies, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| approved by Resolution R-18-10-301 of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| This is Resolution 304.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Okay, can I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Okay, I think the motion came from Commissioner Smith with the second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| All right, Sheriff Spangler, if you could give a little quick insight on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| What this was, it was approved by Commission back in October, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| and all it's doing is we're having to come to Commission to appropriate that money to come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| so that we can use it within our corrections facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| What had happened was Securities wasn't able to perform the duties of that management program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| and so they're not able to do that, so they were willing to reimburse us that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| and we're wanting to be able to put it back into helping us provide another program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| an inmate management program and repairs with our technology program within the corrections division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| So we think that's obviously a good thing for us to be able to get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and we want to be able to put it in that account to where we can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| Okay. All right, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| All right, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| All right, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| On page 6, item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| This is a resolution approving a contract with Baker's Waste Equipment for Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| and Recycling Equipment for Knox County Agencies as needed, resolution 413.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Okay, the motion to approve was by Commissioner Anders, and the second was by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Okay, if you could please provide us an update on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Hey, this is Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter, Solid Waste Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| So it is a contract for waste equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Depending on whether it's a convenience center, we might have compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| or we may have containers that accept recycling or waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| or even something like a school that has a trash dumpster, the type that you would come, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3023)|
| 0:50:31| see at the side of a business, or just other types of waste equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| this contract would allow any county agency to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| It creates a menu of all the types of equipment they offer that they could buy from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| I know that trash and recycling is not always the most exciting thing that we get to discuss at commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| but I'm the one who pulled this just because it's, you know, whatever we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| I know that you hear people talk about what are we doing to be green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| what are we doing to be recycling and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| so will this contract help us increase our recyclables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| and help reduce some of the stuff that we're sending out to the landfills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| or is this just going to be mainly the equipment that's going to help us process it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Well, that equipment, I mean, everything we do, at least at a convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| I can only speak about how we manage convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| everything we do is structured to minimize the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| so we're trying to get people to put waste in a recycle bin or instead of a trash bin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| because a recycle bin, we get a check, the county gets a check, Chris Caldwell likes that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| as opposed to a trash container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| So it is nice to have nice-looking, visually pleasing newer containers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| We think that, you know, it helps people, you know, want to recycle more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| But I would also say the same thing about trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| You know, we try hard to avoid the term dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| People like to call convenience centers dumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| It's a household waste and recycling facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| and we would expect if you came in there, it's managed well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| We're minimizing our costs, and we want it to be clean and easy to use and convenient for residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| But, yes, this contract is more about securing a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Will most of the equipment be used at the convenience centers then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Well, the schools have bought a lot off this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| I think I had mentioned in a summary that, you know, we used to, when we needed equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| I might need something or maybe another agency needed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| And then in 2014, we needed a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| The schools needed a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| We needed something for the Carnes Convenience Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| and we structured a bid that would allow us to have just this menu of all these different types of containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| And it's really worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I would say from a cost standpoint, you know, when you buy a piece of equipment once here, once there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| you may not have a whole lot of terms and conditions to go back if they sell you something that's not that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| But where we're having a consistent vendor, if they sell me something today that I don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| I can go back and say, hey, you know, you really need to honor your warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Their future sales are, you know, their current sales and their past sales, in fact, their future sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| So having a longer-term contract, I think, gives us a little bit better quality merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| Also secures the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| So do we know which facilities are going to be getting any of the new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Well, so the most recent thing we bought off this was all the equipment for the Carter Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| So I would say as we need to replace items, this is the contract I'm going to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| But right now there could be a senior center or some other county facility that might need a new dumpster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3232)|
| 0:54:01| They would also be able to use this contract, not unlike mowing or custodial, any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| So we structured the contract to where any county agency, any department can actually pick this up and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| So our schools and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| Yes, I mean, I guess technically PBA or other public agencies and governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Okay. This item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| All in favor of this item, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Thank you. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Item number 36 is a resolution approving the 2019 Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| subaward agreement for the receipt of funds in the amount of $60,000 for the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| to assist in funding a position to assist in assessing and developing a strategy to deal with the opioid problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| in Knox County for the funding period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| Resolution 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| All right. A motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders, and I heard Commissioner Carringer with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Okay. Dr. Buchanan, I'm the one who actually pulled this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Whenever I see something that we're doing to help fight the opioid epidemic in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| I think it warrants public discussion, and I think this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| and through this commission to public would be interested to know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| So if you could please share some more insight into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Again, Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, Director of the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| This is part of a two-part funding that our community will be receiving to help address the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| This position that we'll be hiring came out of the work from the Mayor's Summit in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| and my staff and the community has been really saying we need somebody that can kind of help have that 10,000-foot view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| of all the things that are being done in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| but also help have that 10,000-foot view of where are the gaps and how do we best fill those gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| help reduce people doing the same thing to try to affect the same problem, and better utilize our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3372)|
| 0:56:22| Another big piece they're going to be doing is to help our Metro Drug Coalition move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| with a community strategic planning process to have a community-wide strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| where business, nonprofits, health care, they all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| they all have an idea of the best practices and what they can do to address the opiate problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Yes, sir. Just a quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Dr. Buchanan is part of a group of people that just received the HIDTA, what we call HIDTA grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| just received an award as the HIDTA unit of the year, I believe, for the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| I know the division, but maybe the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Law enforcement has been prosecuting people for second-degree murder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| for selling to people that overdose in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| and so law enforcement, DA, health department, MDC have done a phenomenal job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| and recently received an award for that work, so this will just continue that push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| So congrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Okay. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| And I second everything Commissioner Anderson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Martha, I've known you for a long time and really appreciate the hard work you're doing for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| especially in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| So we are very lucky to have such a solid, strong health department here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| that hits every part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| So it's a big honor, and we are grateful for the hard work of you and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Okay. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3468)|

| 0:57:53| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3474)|

| 0:58:11| pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 67-5-2507 and 2508,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| and fixing the offering price of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| This is resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Okay. The proper motion on this will be to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Okay. Commissioner Anders makes that motion, and there's a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| Discussion? Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| We have time to public, by changing this to notify the public that this is going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| in the proper length of time, a five-day's notice, since we're changing the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| because we didn't have the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| I'll check with procurement. Go ahead, Commissioner Carington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| Well, our insolvency board consisted of me, Commissioner Biggs, Commissioner Gill, and Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3546)|
| 0:59:15| So, we did not have a quorum there, since it was just Commissioner Biggs and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| So, it has been rescheduled for 4-15 Monday, or as soon as the billboard is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3560)|
| 0:59:29| And that will be exactly five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Drew's already contacted the paper and all, so it should be in the paper Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| So, that will be exactly the fifth day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Thank you. Commissioner Biggs, and then I recognize Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| Would it be you, Mr. Myers, or Ben? I had a quick question. Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3589)|
| 1:00:08| Ben Charble, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| I had a quick question. So, are these the properties that we auction off online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| What's the percentage that the auction company charges Knox County to auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| Is it by each property or as a sale in a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| It's just like any other auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Powell Auction, their bid is 5% of the purchase price to be added on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| The county does not pay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| So, that comes out of the person's pocket that buys the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Okay. I've just had questions about that, and I hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| So, if I were to buy a piece of property or John Smith, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| 5% buyer's premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Okay. All right. Stay there, Ben. All right. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I'll be optimistic, and hopefully at least one of the members will be back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| but I was wanting to ask the law department, what happens if we don't have a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Will this affect timing for you in this sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| If we don't have approval and recommendations of this body without, it's statutorily required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| So, we would have to defer this thing 30 days, and you'd have to defer your auction 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| Correct. But that's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| These sales tend to drag on because of the one-year redemption period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| and waiting on the clerk and master and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| So, we can work around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Okay. Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Okay. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| I'm sorry. Have we ever done this in-house before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| The auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Actually, no, we have not. We've always used Powell Auctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Okay. I didn't know if Howard Hogan may have sold the surplus property or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| and how much it would cost for Knox County to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Since the county doesn't pay anything with Powell Auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| the way we look at it is they're really perfect for this because they bring in a lot of bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| Last auction, we had about 40 properties and made almost a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| and got them back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| So, I mean, it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you for everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Item number 41 is a resolution approving the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| with Lasting Impressions Lawn Care and KMF Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| to provide mowing and general ground maintenance services, resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Is this one that needs to be sent without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| No. The next one that needs to be sent with no recommendation is item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| All right. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Okay. The motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| with a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| I actually had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| So, my number one question is on these mowing contracts, first off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| have we ever done business with KMF or Lasting Impressions Lawn Care previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| Lasting Impressions is an incumbent vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| They were under contract the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| KMF did work for us years ago when we were bidding out for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| Do we know how much the contract and how long the length of a mowing cycle actually is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| I know with the schools, a mowing cycle is 15 days, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| How long is the mowing cycle with schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Ten days. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| So, do we know the length of the mowing cycle as well as about how much it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Mowing cycle is in the contract just before you, I believe, was every five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| With the weather we're having, we'll see how that goes, but it's typically been every five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| So, the reason why I'm asking all these questions is we have an inmate work release program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| that we just basically talked about back, I think it was item number 22 or something like that, or 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| And whenever we talk about that, we talk about putting them back into the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| Is this something that we could do in-house to save money for the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| I certainly can't speak for the sheriff and how many individuals he would have to put on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| We would need to look at, you know, obviously up front you're going to have a capital cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| You're going to have to have a crew, truck, trailer, mowers, blowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| So, there's going to be a capital cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| There's going to be an ongoing maintenance type cost with fuel, oil changes, repairs, or replacement if something breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| I think one of the biggest reasons for doing this for me is the liability transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| I have all the liability on the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| They're responsible for their maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| They're responsible for their equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| They're responsible for their injuries that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| Again, like I said, I've not spoke to the sheriff about does he have capacity, can he do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| and who would pay that up front capital cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| I know that the sheriff's office does have lawn mowers, trucks, and trailers and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So, the main reason I'm doing it is just for savings to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| But I'd like to look a little further into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| I know that if we have natural disasters or acts of God, they have, like, at the cove down just for instance at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3937)|
| 1:05:46| That was very costly to us on cutting trees and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| So, I could see maybe doing that, but I just had really a whole lot of questions about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| and if we could save any money for the taxpayers just because I think having it in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| and maybe letting the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| But, unfortunately, I think the sheriff has already gone to ask him any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Actually, I'd like to make a substitute motion if we could defer it until next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| so that way we can ask the sheriff's office and some other department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| Who made the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| We'll defer it until, send it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Yes, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| That would defer it a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| I think we're coming up on season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| I don't want to get too far down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| But I'll make a motion to send it without recommendation so you can check on that this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| And the second, was that Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| So, do you consent to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Or was it Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Carringer was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| So, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| You're the second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| So, Commissioner Jay, I see your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| I'm going to restate the motion, then I'm going to get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| To restate the motion, the motion has been substituted to send forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| and both the first and second agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I just have a question for our law director, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| Can you help explain to us some of the state statutes of prison labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| and some of the laws around forcing inmates to work versus some of our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| and how that might relate to this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| Number one, we don't force prisoners and inmates to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| It's a voluntary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| It is a time accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| It's agreed by the judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| It's all on that side of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| What they do and don't, I think they have some statutorial limitations on what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| I don't know exactly the whole list here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| but I could probably bring that to you Monday for your discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| But we have very little control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| I mean, the county can't just say we're going to use inmates to go mow yards at a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| This is part of a sentencing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| and it has to be within the jurisdiction of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| and also the jurisdiction of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| So we're really moving outside our normal lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| The sheriff would have to come up with probably some kind of MOU or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| to take over a project like this, even if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| I'll have to look into whether they can even do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| In general, in your opinion, as it relates to county liability and county resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| I know that our inmate crews have done work on a number of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| but in general for normal maintenance, normal operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| and normal services related to our county and our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| from a liability perspective, is it a better option to be using contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| or is it better to look internally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| It's always better to put your liability on somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| I say always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| More often than not, it is better to put your liability on someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| The problem we have oftentimes is that we are considered co-employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| by the way we pay people or the way they get benefits or stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| where we get hung with some of the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| Also, sometimes the state is actually the one in charge of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| but statutorily we're the ones hung with the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| So it all depends on what it is that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| but the general rule of thumb is if we can defer the liability somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| generally we're better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you, Mr. Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Commissioner Biggs, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| I think the entire point might have been missed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| What I was trying to say is two for ones are a real thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| that you get two days for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| It's called good time whenever you are in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| and that saves us hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So what I'm looking out for is the citizens in doing whatever I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| to make sure we can save that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| I think looking narrow-mindedly just in contracts and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| we need to make sure that we cover the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| I understand the liability issue, but we're already mowing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| We have 40-some-odd acres up there at the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| and they mow it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| We need to backpack blow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| The things that I want to look into is the ice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| and snow area eradication on that contract as well as leaf removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| and just making sure that we're covered on all these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| To once again restate the motion, it was actually Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| It was not a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Brad actually changed his motion since it came from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| So Brad changed his motion, and that motion itself is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Item number 43 is a resolution approving the 2019 Appalachia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| high-intensity drug trafficking area subaward agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| for the receipt of funds in the amount of $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| for the Knox County Regional Forensics Center to be used for a software license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| to assist in the tracking of overdose cases as part of the drug-related death task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Resolution 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| and seconded by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| All right, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| I actually was the one who pulled this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| because whenever I see something about such important work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| I wanted to give you a chance to share with us in the public a little more insight to your work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| and this particular grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| John Watt, Regional Forensic Center, 2761 Sullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| This will be the third year that we will get this grant from the Appalachia HIDTA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| and the grant is to help us purchase the software that we use in order to do our caseload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| and to categorize drug overdose deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Just as a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| the Appalachia HIDTA Drug Task Force of the Year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| was comprised of the Knox County DA's Office, KPD, KCSO, the Regional Forensic Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4336)|
| 1:12:25| the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District, and the DEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| I see Commissioner Carringer's line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Thank you, John, for coming to share this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| The data that we get from any, what are we planning on, I guess, using the data that we get back from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4362)|
| 1:12:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| So as part of the work with the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| we provide immediate notification to KPD, KCSO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| and the Knox County DA's Office about possible drug overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| They're able to follow that within our system and work with us on drug overdose cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| Then we take that data cumulatively at the end of the year and produce our annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| and I've shared the annual report with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| It's also online under the Knox County Regional Forensic Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| and it provides you data about what types of overdose are happening, how many, the locations of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| the types of drugs that are being found, and other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Seeing no other discussion items, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Item number 46 is a resolution approving the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated Subsection 8-21-101J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4436)|
| 1:14:06| to authorize the Knox County Register of Deeds to demand and receive a $2 electronic filing email submission fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| for each electronically filed document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| which is recorded over the Internet through the Knox County Register of Deeds Office electronic filing portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| This is resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| The Chair does not recognize those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| I believe this is one of the ones that came to us that required a motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| Are we missing one piece of paperwork on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| Jill, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Two-thirds of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Yeah, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I had a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| So that motion, we do require a two-thirds vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| This is something that we'll need to have a special vote on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| So we send it forward with no recommendation in order to get the two-thirds vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Keep it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| So we've already pulled it from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| So the proper motion is to send this forward with no recommendation to be voted on next week with a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| So who made the move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Item number 50 is resolution approving a procreation in the amount of from the general fund balance for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4532)|
| 1:15:41| Knox County, planning to begin development of updating the county growth and general plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| This is resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Can I get a motion for approval so we can discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| We don't have a total on this one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| I know Gerald Green had sent me a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| I'll share that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| But I know we're probably going to want to have some discussion with both Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Green on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| I'd like to make a motion to send without recommendation because it's got a blank in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| So we have a motion to consent forward with no recommendation from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| and I think I heard Commissioner Carringer with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| So we have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| I'm going to ask Mr. Green to come forward on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Gerald Green, Knoxville, Knox County, planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| I've contacted consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Other communities have undergone updates of their county general plan, and the prices, I'll be honest, astounded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4593)|
| 1:16:44| The prices came in, as I mentioned in an email to you, Commissioner, our chair at Nystrom, around $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| Was that a bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| It would have to be a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| What we would have to do is prepare a request for a proposal, send it out nationally for firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| They would respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| We'd work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Mr. Charvel is gone, but we've worked with him in the past, go through the county procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| Then identify a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| The way we have to do it is identify a consultant who meets the standards and requirements we set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| Then after selecting that consultant, we would negotiate a contract with the price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| and if we could not reach an agreeable price with that consultant, we would fall back to the second in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| I'm sorry, perhaps I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Where did you get the $350,000 from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| From talking to different consultants who do this type of work, giving them a broad outline for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| talking to other communities who have undergone similar processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| This was, to be honest, on the low end, and I think in doing this we would look for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| especially if we could work with the Knox County Engineering and Public Works on combining transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| there might be some transportation planning funds that we could leverage with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| In the past, have we contracted out our general plan away from the MPC, and what all would that involve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4683)|
| 1:18:13| That was way before my time, so I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| I know the latest big project that we've undertaken is the updating of the city of Knoxville zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| and that was contracted with a consultant at a price of $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| That was zoning codes, not a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| And there's not that much, I think the key elements are community input, working with all the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| drafting that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| So we are going to contract out people to come here and hold these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| or is MPC staff going to hold these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| That would be a combination of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| We would work with them, but they would do the bulk of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| We don't have staff to carry on the work that we have to do with plan review, development review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| zoning ordinance updates, and do this work also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Or excuse me, that's Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| We talked before about how we're going to do our plans in the future if we get by this urban growth boundary situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4747)|
| 1:19:16| which should be sunset pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| But we talked about the developments are changing so rapidly of how things we used to do in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| and what we're doing now where we're developing more communities instead of just a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| because a lot of people like to build and live within community structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| Shouldn't we have, before we start getting somebody or a bid out like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| sort of get a consensus from the community of how they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| before we even start putting out, I guess, just a general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| And that's the process in talking with the consultants in the other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| One of the items I mentioned was the need for a lot of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| And what we do is what we would propose doing is going out to those communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| working with them to get their input on how the county, including their community, should develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| And that would generate the basis for the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| The general plan may, in fact, dictate that we start looking at more community-centric mode of development in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4823)|
| 1:20:32| as opposed to sort of a sprawl anywhere it can occur that growth occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4832)|
| 1:20:40| So your question is good, but we need that input from the communities to build the general plan for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| and provide direction for the county to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| And again, you know, instead of putting a notification in the paper or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| say we're going to have it next week or five days or ten days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| go to these different communities since you have centers and other community groups to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| Go ahead and start saying, give them, say, 30 or 45 days notice and redo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| Say we're going to meet in this area for this community and this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| So it gives people time to plan to be there and things of that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| so we get the most we can out of the public for what their ideas for their future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| not just what we say it's going to be, but what they think it should be in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| So I don't know how we do that, but we should start making a plan for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| instead of, I mean, go ahead and spend money on something that may not even be relevant to the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4893)|
| 1:21:40| in which they're going to try to issue those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| One thing we've done already is starting to identify existing community groups in different parts of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| and looking at how do we tie into their regular meetings so we don't ask people to come to another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| but just to a meeting that they've already come and invited instead of just their membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| or broader population of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| And then once we get that information, shouldn't we kind of compile it maybe through your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| and say these communities see this and this community over here sees this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| because you'll have a different aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Say you go to Gibbs or that area out through there, even North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| my area will be a little bit different than some of the other cosmopolitan type areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| on what they see the plans for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| So I don't know how we start compiling that and then say, okay, how do you make this fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| Yes, and that would be one of the tasks of the consultant to work with those communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| gather all that information and compile it and then present it first to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| and then to this commission for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| You're saying that if this body in our county wants to go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| which we've exhausted that conversation with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| that the Knox County, Knoxville planning department that you run does not have the bandwidth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| to take that on unilaterally with everything else that is currently in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Ultimately, if we want to pursue that, an outside consultant would be needed to facilitate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| working with you, but ultimately being the body that is driving the boat on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| That's correct, except driving the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| I think this commission and the planning commission would be driving the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| Driving the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| And, you know, in looking at this, if we did it in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| we'd have to hire additional staff, incur that cost, and it would take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| And we wouldn't know what the cost, having gone through this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| doing it with the department that I worked within, it took a lot of staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| It took longer, and the cost was likely greater when you calculated it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| I think this way we know what the cost is, we know what the time schedule is, and we can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| We bring in expertise that, quite frankly, our staff may not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| because we'll be working with consultants who do this on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| And I just had, Mr. Chairman, if you could clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| is the resolution asking to begin the procurement process to identify a bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| or is it looking for a very specific dollar amount to allocate towards the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| Well, I'll state the intent, and then I'll state the resolution, Joe, because let's start with our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| Our intent was to make a demonstratable statement that we as a board have committed to redo our growth plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5085)|
| 1:24:55| and then turn to general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Step one on that, at our last meeting, I committed that we had at least put on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| to begin that process of figuring out the budget for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| So when we put this on the agenda, it was really, let's take a look at the finances on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| if it was as simple as beginning to appropriate the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| This is something that's going to happen over multiple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| so it's something that we could partially fund this year and then fund the rest of it next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| or even the cycle after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| So we potentially can fund this over two years for sure, potentially three, I hope not, but definitely two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| The right motion may end up being, once again, it's kind of like the growth plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| We put that on here to prompt the discussion, but is the right answer to say that we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| instead of making a specific number, which we don't even have yet since we're going to have to put an RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| is the right motion maybe for the meeting next week to say we authorize to work with purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| to begin developing an RFQ to begin this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| That might actually be the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| I think we want to sort of make our intent known and say go forth and find us the best option for the best price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| and then bring it back for approval down the road and not hold up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| I think we've got to get it on there so the public knows that, hey, we're moving on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| So does that clarify your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Yes, sir. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Looking at Commissioner Smith had a line on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| He was the first one to come in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| So go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| And then I'm thinking we had Bussler and then Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Oh, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| All right, then Carringer, then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| I've already spoke once, so Carringer would be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| Because the East Sector community, when you're planning, is going on right now at Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5205)|
| 1:26:53| And I guess they didn't realize that we would be meeting tonight, but that left myself out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| Commissioner Beeler out, and Commissioner Gill out of not even being able to attend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| when you're planning meeting tonight, which affects our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| So my other question is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| So I'm just wondering how that looks to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| But I hope they will find out where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| But my other one is a question about is there not anything that CTAS can help with on any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5241)|
| 1:27:32| First, I apologize for the meeting being scheduled tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| We have City Council, Historic Zoning Commission, Downtown Design Review, Board of Zoning Appeals, Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| So it's hard to find an empty night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| And I think back two months ago when we scheduled the one-year plan meeting, which is a city requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| we didn't realize that this meeting, the Commissioner's meeting, would be shifted tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| So I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| And the answer to your second question is pretty short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| CTAS does not provide this type of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| They can provide some broad parameters, but getting this level of assistance is not within their purview anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5286)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Yeah, we've already spoken on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Yeah, Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Charlie had spoken earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| So, yeah, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| In your quest to find consultants to do this work, were they ones that have already done work in the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5308)|
| 1:28:39| And, number two, were they aware that this is for basically a county-only correction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| Some of them had previously done work in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Not all of the ones I contacted had done work in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| They were aware it was for the county only, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Then Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| I'm having a hard time keeping track of everybody tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Director Green, the growth policy plan is kind of in limbo at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| It's still in place, but it's in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| We're trying to reconvene the committee, and I think the state has a piece of legislation in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| So there's really three options that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| The committee makes an amendment to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| The state makes a statute that requires us to make a plan that could have all kinds of things in it or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5376)|
| 1:29:45| In order for us to do a general plan, we need to know what the growth policy plan dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5385)|
| 1:29:53| I'm all for allocating this money, and I think part of the reason why it's before us now is because, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| we all wanted to come forward with it and show the public that we are committed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| But also, Director Caldwell, is there a time frame we have to allocate those funds from last year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5405)|
| 1:30:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| The funds that were in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| The fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| Well, it would just be a designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| In this instance, it would be an estimate and appropriate from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| So I think depending on what you all do, I would look to see if we could end the year with some sort of monies to put toward this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5435)|
| 1:30:45| so we wouldn't just estimate from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| So it's a fund balance from the current budget we're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Is there a time frame by which that has to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| We'll have to make sure that we're going to have a budget surplus, and if that's the case, we do that in the course of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5460)|
| 1:31:08| But if you all needed it prior, then we'd have to talk, and it would have to be an estimation and appropriation from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| But I think we need to wait and see what our directions come, because they're going to come from either the committee or the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| But I am all for going ahead and setting aside funds for it with the caveat or contingency that the money is not spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5483)|
| 1:31:34| until we know what our growth plan policy dictates our general plan should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| I just wanted to add this on, which I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| At the state, we have a bill that may extend the present urban growth boundaries for another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5506)|
| 1:31:59| So it depends if that passes on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| We will be bound underneath that again of what we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| It's just extending it on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| So I don't know if we – I'm for going ahead and making a plan like it's going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| Hopefully it sunsets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| And it will sunset, I'm not sure, next year or the year after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| Mr. Law Director, do you know when that may sunset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| If they don't extend it, I think it's supposed to sunset in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| My understanding of the legislation that's currently within the state, they're extending it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| but they're also having a requirement to reestablish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| And almost it sounds like it's starting from scratch again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| You have to have a new plan by 2031.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| That's my understanding, too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| And I think that's where having the general plan in place may inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| If we have to have a new growth policy plan, then that would inform the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| and we'd have data and analysis on which to base what may be a new growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| and we'd take it in those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| I understand what Commissioner Smith is talking about and some of the rest of you would have some uncertainties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| but I think we start this process and we can serve us in several ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| and regardless of what may happen with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I think the updated general plan would be a good tool for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Would it not have to conform to the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| Yes, it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Can or has to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| It has to, and the general plan can conform to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| Again, maybe if we can't get agreement from the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| which I think we can, we need to look at some of those restrictions in the growth policy plan and amend those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5629)|
| 1:33:58| The general plan would inform that and give us the background and the information to argue for revising the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| if that's the direction we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| I'm just worried about spending money and it not be applicable, that we have to go back and do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| And I would make sure we keep in a direction where we don't have to do it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| that we stay somewhat nimble but go to those communities, get the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| What direction do we want, do the citizens of Knox County want this county to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| and then use that as data, if need be, to amend the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5667)|
| 1:34:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Mr. Chairman, my light has not gone off since I started talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Sorry about that. Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| The only reason why I brought this up is if it sunsets and goes away, we've got to react and have a growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| I'm with Mr. Smith on this, that we should start making a basis of what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| If it doesn't and they continue on and extend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| then we're going to have to deal with the growth plan that we want to try to do away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| And this growth plan extension has come from two of the representatives from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| And what we want to do, I think this body wanted to do, was to make it go away, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| The urban growth boundary, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Is that not what we decided on one time before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| That's not how we voted last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| So, anyway, let's make sure it doesn't go through, it sunsets, and then we can go with our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| That's all I'm trying to say, is let's be careful doing money, but we need the plan to start being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| This comment is for Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Are you referring to House Bill 717 and Senate Bill 530?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Okay. Well, that actually now is a caption bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| So those dates that you saw on that bill, that's just there because they wanted to select the certain parts of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5760)|
| 1:36:10| So that's in limbo right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| It's been assigned to the, I think it's property and planning subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| But at this point, it's still just a caption bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| Yes, Mr. Skinmaker, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| But, again, it can metastasize into what it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| So we just need to make sure that it stays where it is right now just as a caption bill or whatever it does, and maybe it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5790)|
| 1:36:40| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Just real quick, did anyone send a letter to the city of Knoxville or Town of Farragut yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| I've drafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| The law department is reviewing it, and it will be going out probably, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| Daniel Sanders has got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| It will probably be going out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Here's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| We've talked this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| We've got a motion on the floor, I believe, to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| We do want to begin the process of moving forward to update our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Now, I'm going to say, when I say plans, I'm talking about we've got a growth plan and we've got a general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| both of which are similar, but they're not exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| So the next step on this, Mr. Green, I want to get back to something I brought up originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| which is, is the proper motion to begin maybe the request to Myers or to the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5852)|
| 1:37:41| to begin drafting what a proposal would look like on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| At this point, that's not allocating any money, but this could give you the chance to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| here are the requirements that we're looking forward, that we need out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| That is also something that could be shared with this commission to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| and then we could let a motion to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| We're not even approving that yet, but I think that's probably the right step to begin moving forward on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| so that we are beginning to take action rather than just talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| That would give me direction in my staff in working with the procurement and Mr. Charvel probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5893)|
| 1:38:22| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| So what I'd like to do is if one of the commissioners would make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5904)|
| 1:38:32| if this is acceptable to this body, to begin drafting that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| We've got that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| So we probably need to defer it to next Monday, where we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5920)|
| 1:38:48| so that motion to defer is on the floor for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| Or is that, to send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| So let's send it forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| At next week's meeting, we'll make adjustments similar to what we've discussed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| and then approve it so that we can begin to move forward on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| That's not allocating any specific funds, but that's probably a good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Brian Hare, 12811 Saddle Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| Point of clarification from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| it was the understanding of the mayor's office that we were instructed by a commission to send the letter to City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5956)|
| 1:39:24| Town of Farragut, along with KUB, Hallsdale Powell, Soil Conservation District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| and the school board, which we have drafted, and that letter is going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I was unaware that commission was also sending out a letter because the commission doesn't have jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| over the City of Knoxville or the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| The last month vote, the commission directed the chairman to write a letter to those three parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| The only party of significance that the original letter would have any matter to is the mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| The mayor of Knox County has the jurisdiction over the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| The mayor of Knox County, in that letter, would do what you're exactly saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| because all of the parties he has to then organize and call together, which includes the other two mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| and the KUB and the appointed officials from each of the different parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| But the chairman was, I would assume, the letters to put the other two on notice that the mayor is going to request something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6016)|
| 1:40:25| It was the only reason I could see where it was coming from at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| But this body voted to, it's really a request of the mayor because the mayor has the jurisdiction over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| I just don't understand why commission needs to send a letter advising that the mayor is going to send a letter when he's sending a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| It seems like government at its finest to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| You'd have to talk to the chairman of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| The main step to take forward, process-wise, is for us to send the formal letter to the mayor just to begin this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6050)|
| 1:40:58| Which we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Yep, which you've done. So that's the main step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Okay, moving forward, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| Is there any discussion? Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| Motion is to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Motion is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Okay, the ayes have it. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Chairman, before we go, I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| I'll be out of town next week, so if any of the commissioners have any questions regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| if they want to call me or email me or come by and see me prior to next week, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| I'll blame it on a fellow county employee who talked me into an adventure trip next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6098)|
| 1:41:47| Please, if you have any questions or want to discuss it, let me know, and I'll be happy to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| All right, thank you. All right, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Item number 52 is a resolution urging the Tennessee General Assembly to support Senate Bill 1126,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6115)|

| 1:42:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Okay, the motion to approve was made by Commissioner Schoonmaker, second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| All right, all in favor of this item, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6141)|

| 1:44:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Yeah, Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| I was just going to see if anybody had any questions about the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6289)|

| 1:45:27| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| The motion has been made by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Just as Mr. Snowden, I mean, I'm sorry, not Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Mr. Caldwell is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| It involves Mr. Snowden's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| Could you clarify the number nine on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Because I'm sure Commissioner Daley is in the watching this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| And if it says, did that actually say a litter grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| Is that what that says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Being transferred to another department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Nine and ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| I know that ten is a duplicate of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Is a duplicate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Because it says SW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| So is SW stormwater or what is, it comes out of engineering and public works or solid waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| They're moving salary dollars from solid waste, the litter grant, into the convenience center or codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6390)|
| 1:46:46| But is this a litter grant for actually going out and picking up on the side of the roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| and now we're eliminating that position and moving it just to a full-time employee at the solid waste center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6413)|
| 1:47:18| And then for the record, number ten is a duplicate of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6438)|
| 1:47:33| I think, Commissioner, and I can check with Drew to get specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| but I'm fairly certain that this is essentially moving the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| but the position will essentially serve the same function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| in the sense of the personnel is being moved into a new funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| but the personnel will still do the same job, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| I'll have to get you a better answer on that specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| but I think that from the perspective of it will not disadvantage any litter grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| or litter pickup in the county is what I know your concern and Carson's maybe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| But I'll confirm that and send you an e-mail in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Mr. Chair, since we have this question, should this be moved with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| But it was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Was that the way it was presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| I didn't hear that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Any additional questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Item number 57 will be heard Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| This is item number 58, presentation of the emergency services study by CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| It will be next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| So that will be moved to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6533)|

| 1:49:01| regarding the cultural diversity training for school personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| I want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| We don't have to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| We're doing a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Do you want to talk to that now or do you want to wait until next Monday since you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| having so much fun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| Monday is going to be packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| I'm happy to do whatever you would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Basically, I know when we first came up, I had asked some questions what it was to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| You know, like is it going to improve test scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| Is it going to increase our better understanding of the cultures around us that would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| people, I guess, assimilate with one another and things of that sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| The only reason why I'm asking this is when I was back in college, we spent a whole quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| doing the find of what culture is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| I thought this was unique, so I just want to know what we're getting out of the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| that we're doing the study with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| How's the teachers and employees of Knox County reacting to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| I can tell you that to date, we have trained 4,622 of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| We have over 8,000 employees, so I hope that number is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| We're about a little over halfway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| We were actually supposed to have a training this Monday to do another large group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| However, we were out because of the sickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Overall, I think our responses from teachers have been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| We have, when we look at our overall ratings, every session has an evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| and we will look at the evaluation scores overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| There are some people that really like it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| There are some people that are not as pleased, and both of those numbers I would call, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| the people that like it the least are the smallest numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| I think middle of the road is how I would describe the overall reception of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| So we've had some, again, very positive and some very strong feedback on the other end, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| I think that Ms. Campbell has attended far more sessions than I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| so she can speak to maybe some of the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| But the focus has been really an overview of understanding of just cultural diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| implicit bias, and then really looking at how do we help think about the lessons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| that we're teaching in our classroom and do culturally competent pedagogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| The other thing I would share is that this has been our year one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| so year one really was the overview to kind of get a common language for all of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| We'll have a make-up session for either new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| or folks that didn't get to attend this school year in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| But then the second phase, and then we're still kind of designing what that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| with the University of Tennessee, but our plan is that we're going to have the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| that are doing our training come and meet with our principal advisory council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| and talk about what that next level of training will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| because it will be more focused on schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| So schools will be doing some needs assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| determining what areas they want some support for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| and then the training will become much more individualized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| because, as all of you are aware from this community, we are a very diverse community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| and no two schools have the same kind of needs and personality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Would you add anything to that, Ms. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| The only thing I would add is that we still are continuing to take feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| and look at the responses from all of our staffs for all of the sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| incorporating that and sharing that with the provider that's currently providing those particular things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| to make sure that we are sensitive to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| We know it's a very sensitive topic in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| but definitely how we're approaching that and hearing from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| and continue to refine the process as we move forward and complete the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| You also made a statement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| You said the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| I think in the booklet I think that you all were using, or I've seen in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| it said the University of Tennessee did a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Did they do a study through all the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| They are in the process of doing some research based on the training and the feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| but that's not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| But they did get permission through our research and development office to do a research study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| I misunderstood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| The way it read in the book there that they had already done the study in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| and that's where this program came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Dr. Coleman-King, who is the lead presenter, has a pretty extensive background and knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| I can't speak specifically about what her areas of research are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| but I feel confident in saying she's done some work around this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Is there a way that we can get any of the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| or the results and all in writing sent to us about the results of what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6825)|
| 1:53:53| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Do you want a copy of the materials that are being utilized or just a copy of the evaluations, summaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| Well, both would be great if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| I won't need one of those studies, your evaluation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| It was hard enough to read through the book, all the things that you went through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| so I was impressed with what you're trying to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| But I didn't see anything about the studies that UT did in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| and what schools they went through and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| And I thought they would have probably touched every school in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| before they started that evaluation, and I wasn't sure, and that was one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6873)|
| 1:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| The next item is discussion regarding collecting business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Commissioner Biggs, this is something you had brought to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| and I wanted to give you a brief opportunity to provide that insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| especially maybe helpful for our folks who appoint people with the legislators in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| I appreciate it, and thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| So I've been looking into the business tax and how to collect business tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| and what I've run across is we have really, and I believe Mr. Armstrong could also attest to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| there's no teeth in collecting business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| There's really nothing that we can do other than maybe place judgments or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| What I would like to see is maybe our legislative affairs committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| maybe talk to some of the legislative body and look and see if we can look at some sort of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6928)|
| 1:55:36| to where when you go to get your business license renewed every year, you have to be paid current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| That would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| Right now in business tax there's a little over $3 million delinquent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| and with the hall tax being gone, I believe this could be a huge asset to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| I don't know all the ins and outs about who we could speak with that might do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| and I realize we're a little late in the ballgame, and it might be something we're looking at next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| but if we could do it collectively together, I mean, I think it would be huge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Is there any additional insight on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| What you may want to, just as a request, we posted that on the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Can I tighten that up in just kind of a paragraph and formally share that with that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| so that they'll have a little bit of your background on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| That would be smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| All right. Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| I think we had a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Did we move that to next week, item 61, which was the update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| So that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| Is there anyone here from the public who would like to address commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Seeing none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| we'll entertain a motion for dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Yeah. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| We now have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| This meeting, we have a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| We now have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| Madam Clerk, would you please call roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7032)|

| 1:57:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| They don't say when, you've got to say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7063)|

| 1:57:48| Is there anyone who would like to speak to public forum on this subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| I don't want to have her read the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Well, I'll begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| I think I've got public forum on my agenda first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR190219?start=7076)|
