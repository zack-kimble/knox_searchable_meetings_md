| 0:02:55| For the mayor's report, again, thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| The weather is not so friendly this evening, so we do appreciate everybody who made the effort to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| As always, when we have inclement weather, I want to recognize and thank our public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| Thank you, Councilman Roberto, for recognizing public service and KFD and KPD, our emergency responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=192)|
| 0:03:21| who are out there working to keep everybody safe and trying to keep the roads passable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| Also, we want to thank our CAT bus drivers who are running all the routes they safely can to provide transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| for people who have no other way to get to work or to get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| And speaking of the dedication of our first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| I'm sure everybody knows that we had a Knoxville Police Department officer shot in the line of duty last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| Fortunately, Officer Jay Williams is home and recovering, and the suspect is in custody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| and I want to ask Chief Roush to say a few words about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you, Mayor, and thanks to the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| And I also really want to thank the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| The community has been great reaching out and expressing their concern and their prayers for Officer Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| and the other officers who diligently were searching for the suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| We are glad that he was taken into custody early Saturday morning as a result of a community effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| and an effort of law enforcement, both federal, state, and local officers working together to bring this to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=265)|
| 0:04:33| The good news is he wasn't able to hurt anyone else, didn't hurt anyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| and he was not harmed when he was taken into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| And so he had some injuries, but those were all self-inflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| Basically, the incident, Officer Williams was trying to stop a vehicle that was driving recklessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| The suspect started shooting at him as he was attempting to stop him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| When the vehicle spun out of control, the suspect got out and fired some more rounds at Officer Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| struck him with a double-out buckshot is what hit him in the shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| Fortunately, UT Medical Center, a great team there, treated him very well and was able to remove the buckshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| And as you said, he's home recovering, doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| The message today from him was that the wound is clotting, which is a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| That means he's healing and that he's getting a little bit of movement in his shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Still sore, obviously, from it, so he'll still have a little recovery time before he gets back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| Suspect is in custody and certainly will face the charges for the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| And I spoke to him as recently as right before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| and he expressed his gratitude to all the outpouring of support, both from the city and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=351)|
| 0:05:59| He was in good spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| He was laughing and grateful that that's as worse as it was and as bad as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| And, you know, he's gotten at least Officer of the Month twice, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| and I understand he's up for a Lifesaver Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And so he's somebody that gives his all to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| So we'll all continue to pray for him and to wish him a speedy recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| He's got 14 years in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| As he told me, that's only about halfway through his career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| So I told him, get well soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| We need you back out there on the streets doing what you do so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| Also, we want to thank all of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| This is just a reminder of what they face just doing their job every day, stopping a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| You never know what might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| So we respect their work, and we thank them for what they do for us every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| So moving on, yesterday was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| and we just wrapped up another great week of local events sponsored by the MLK Commemorative Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| Among the many events were the Interfaith Prayer Service last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| the Annual Awards Luncheon last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| and yesterday the parade, the Memorial Tribute Service, and the Night with the Arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| and many more activities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| They were all very well organized and attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| It was pretty chilly for the parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| but we got walking fast and actually kind of got overheated with those nice little hills in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| So I want to thank the Commemorative Commission for the work that goes into these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| It really does bring the community out and brings the community together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| to rededicate ourselves to continuing Dr. King's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| I also want to give a special recognition to two city staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| who were volunteer members of the commission, Clarence Vaughn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| who is our Executive Director of the Police Advisory Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| and Tasha Harris, the city's Title VI coordinator and our Save Our Sons grant manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| They're both on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| They help plan it, and Clarence is actually the chair of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| He's been that for the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and so we appreciate what both of them do as well as the entire committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Any reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Did you mention the discovery announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| I just think, of course, everybody should have heard that once a merger goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| the discovery plans on moving their operational headquarters to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| and I just think that was a huge win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| I mean, I'm not an expert in mergers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| but usually when a big company buys a small company, the smaller company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| I think normally the small company employees go to where the big company is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| But not if you're located in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| So I think it really goes to the strength of the business environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| and the efforts of the administration and the chamber, and I'm sure the state was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| So anyway, I think it made me feel really good, and I think we should all be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| Yeah, thanks for mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| It's also, I mean, it's really due to Scripps building such a great organization right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| They have a wonderful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| They have a really talented workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| So I think the first honor goes to Scripps for what they have built here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180116?start=570)|
