| 0:01:00| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| I would like to postpone 10A, the appeal of the North Shore Center, until September the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=67)|

| 0:01:35| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=96)|

| 0:01:40| Any opposed? Those consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| For the Mayor's Report, we've got a new development opening tomorrow at the University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=104)|
| 0:01:53| Really the first retail store will open, and that's Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| And the grand opening there is at 7 a.m. We'll have a ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| So I invite you all to be out there bright and early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| And I know some of us have toured the site recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| And for the last two years we've been seeing the drawings and watching that project unfold as the University Commons was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| You all approved a TIF and an infrastructure grant to make University Commons possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| But it really is impressive when you actually get out there and see the size of that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| and the fact that it's a very creative urban redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| It took an abandoned industrial brownfield, put parking underneath, and built a two-story plaza on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| And it's going to have some neat ways to get your shopping carts up when Publix opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| And it's very interesting to see the kind of development they did there and the great use of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| So the Walmart opening is tomorrow. That's just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| In a few weeks, Publix will open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| And then there will be a grand opening for the entire development sometime next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| And once we get that date, we'll let you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| So Mayor Burchett will be joining us tomorrow. I hope you all will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| And, of course, the public is invited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Also remember that CAT will start tomorrow running its new downtown trolley route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| which will drop off and pick up at University Commons Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| This means that people downtown or really anywhere in the city will be able to take public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| and then be able to come down and do their shopping at University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| So that's tomorrow, 7 a.m., at the University Commons development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| Next Saturday, August 16th, will be the 7th Annual History Fair sponsored by the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| This is a great event that brings thousands of people to our downtown every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| with historical displays and reenactments, musical performances, and children's activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| This History Fair will be from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Crouch Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| and at the East Tennessee History Center on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| As part of the History Fair, there will be two vintage baseball games at World's Fair Park at noon and at 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| So if you want to see how they used to play baseball here in the 19th century, here's your chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| And one of the things they do is they, it's a small, it's like a baseball, but they don't use gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| And so I'm looking forward to that, to seeing that game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| And again, that's Saturday, August 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Also, I hope you all saw the good news we got from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Nate Allen, a 28-year veteran of KPD, has been promoted from captain to deputy chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| He will be assigned as division commander of the Criminal Investigations Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| And if you have interacted with Nate, professional and diligent, he has always been in his service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| And this is great news for him and I think for the entire department and for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| So please join me next Thursday, August 14th, at 4 p.m. in the Coliseum Ballroom for his formal promotion ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=299)|
| 0:05:08| It's actually already become effective, I think, July 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| But we'll have the formal ceremony on August 14th at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| And also don't forget that Thursday, this coming Thursday, is election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| You know, there was a few weeks of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| But on Thursday, there will be the county general election and the state and federal primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| So we encourage everybody to come out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| A lot of people showed up in early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| So hopefully that means we're going to get a lot of people on election day as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| And now, just for the final part of the report, I want to ask Christy Branscom to report on the MediaWorks Demo Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| that Knoxville Entrepreneur Center sponsored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Yes, so Demo Day started at 4 o'clock today and they're probably finishing up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| But it's a celebration of all the participants in Knoxville Entrepreneur Center's digital media cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| As the mayor said, it's called MediaWorks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| It celebrated nine different entrepreneur individuals or entities who participated in the cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| and they're pitching their new business ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| The mayor and I were able to see several of these pitches this afternoon and this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| And it was a great experience to see all these wonderful, creative people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| who are so passionate about their business ideas pitch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And there were several investors in the audience, so that was very exciting for them and for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| It was great to see the KEC and how they're working to foster the development of businesses in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| And, of course, hopefully that will turn into jobs for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| So if you get an invite to one of those events in the future, I strongly suggest you go to watch the pitches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| It's fascinating to watch and it really is motivating to see these people so passionate about their own ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| Actually, the first person who pitched was Hasib Qureshi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| I think I pronounced that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Y'all met him before he is working on our website, the new website design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| And he also was a part of the MediaWorks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| So really exciting stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Councilman Dela Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| I just wanted to give everyone an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| We've been looking at the East Town Mall or Knoxville Mall, Knoxville Center Mall area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| and what can be done to help that area get a little bit more exposure since it's hidden down in the valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| and behind the trees and the earth berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Anyway, the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation is proposing and has out for, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| at least review or comment, some new regulations that will allow cities with more than 100,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| which happens to include us, to have these logo signs on urbanized exits of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=471)|
| 0:08:02| Prior to this new set of rulemaking, the rule had been only the first exit in or out of a municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=482)|
| 0:08:10| with over 100,000 people can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| And I don't know whether that was anti-clutter or just the concern that maybe there'd be too many distractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| But that particular exit, which is Exit 8 on I-640, would greatly benefit, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| from some notice to the traveling public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| There are 70,000 cars a day that go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Just over that little grassy knoll is great shopping opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| and that will produce jobs and tax revenues for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| I think it's a win-win all around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| It apparently is set up so that the city can request the commissioner of transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| and I assume we do that by resolution and or letter or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| to let us proceed and evaluate individual intersections in our boundaries and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| So I think it's a great opportunity for us to help our businesses do what they do best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| and help our city with jobs and revenue, and I'm looking forward to working with the council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Any other council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| 8A is the resolution confirming the appointment of Christina Wright and Chad Boettger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| to the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=576)|

| 0:09:38| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Benefiel Richter's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| to assess 21 city facilities to determine level of adherence to the 2010 ADA standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=582)|

| 0:09:52| in an amount not to exceed $130,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=592)|

| 0:09:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| 11B is a resolution authorizing the issuance, sale, and payment of inter-fund loan capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| outlay notes not to exceed $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| If Jim York is there and can visit with us, just a question or two, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| as you get up to the podium here and introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I was expecting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| You just happened to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| This relates to that $5 traffic citation thing we just acted on in the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| that would allow the city to collect funds for this five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| And as I understand this loan capital outlay note that you're proposing we issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| you would anticipate that revenue now so that you could get on with the business of setting up this new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| that will electronically help the police and the court system process all of these traffic violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| Here's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| What happens if the revenue don't come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| What if everyone drives carefully, doesn't get cited, doesn't get convicted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Who's on the hook for the $800,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Is that the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Well, what we have proposed is what we call technically an inter-fund loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| If we buy the equipment and the revenues are insufficient in whatever deficit there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=686)|
| 0:11:35| then we will still have the equipment in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| We will still have addressed some of the safety concerns that are present with the e-citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| But the city would be paying directly for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| It's a general obligation type note, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| It is structured as if it were a general obligation note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Again, this is kind of a complicated housekeeping type measure because what we're doing is we're borrowing from ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| We are not going out to a bank or issuing any sort of formal debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| But we're borrowing from our existing coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| But the way that the state applies inter-fund loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| we have to treat it as if it were basically similar to a third-party borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| All the same precautions that you would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I thought that was worth both knowing and sharing to our listening public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| And I would just add, you know, with most technical upgrades that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| which we do quite often, say in the police cars or, you know, our radios, different things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| usually we have to fund them straight out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| This is a technical upgrade that we'll be doing that there's actually a revenue source to help pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| So hopefully it will pay for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| If it doesn't, it's still an investment that's going to have longer payoffs for us in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| So, you know, we're comfortable with making that investment into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| And we're thankful that our ticketed offenders will be helping to pay it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| We need a – I'm sorry, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Well, I wanted to ask Jim York a couple of questions just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| So we haven't bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| We haven't bought the equipment yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| And so we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| The $800 is a general marker number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| It's a budget number at this point, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| The $800 – and, again, we don't have exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| I think our initial estimates are somewhere between $500,000 to $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| But what we hope to do here is we always go on the high side because if, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| we were to put $550,000 and it went $551,000, we would have to start this loan process all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| So it is structured to say it is up to $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| And, again, we think that's a fairly generous type estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| But, again, it's probably going to be in the $500,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| And so based on $500,000 or $600,000, how long do you think it will take to pay that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| If the costs were, say, $600,000, it would run, by my estimate, slightly less than four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=851)|
| 0:14:22| If it goes to $800,000, it's going to take the full five years to amortize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| So there's still – KPD is still in the process of getting proposals and getting those costs and coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| At this point, we don't even have an RFP out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| But that will be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| We can start, I think, acquiring some of the equipment up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Monies have actually started coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Again, they're not extensive, but we have had at least one person pay any citation fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| Yeah, $4 so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| We may have more at – we had $4 as of yesterday, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| You keep a running tab on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Well, I think that, you know, I understand Councilman Della Vopi's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| but unfortunately I think that the folks out there driving won't find a way to get this paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| I mean, I hope not, but I think that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| But let's also not lose sight of the safety that it creates for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| And efficiency, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Well, efficiency is one thing, but saving lives is another thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and this is definitely a proven fact, what Chief Roush shared with us at the last meeting about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| how many officers are actually killed while on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Standing on their shoulder, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| So I think it's a worthy piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I think it will help on many fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| We need a roll call for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Vice Mayor Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with the Jarvis Award Sign and Flag Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| for the downtown Knoxville Wayfinding Project in an amount not to exceed $1,217,009.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=989)|
| 0:16:40| I'll move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| I have watched this process for some years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| and I'm delighted that it's coming to an end and that we will soon see the results of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| I was a little bit surprised by the total cost or the cost estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| So, Anne, if you would come down and kind of walk us through this process, I sure would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Good evening, Mayor and members of the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Anne Wallace, City of Knoxville, 400 Main Street, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| The cost estimate is right in line with what our engineer's estimate was for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| It's also right in line with the budget that we estimated through the Transportation Improvement Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| the TIP, through the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| We estimated originally $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| We're within probably 10% of that at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| and so we're very pleased to see the numbers coming in within the overall budget that we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| Yes, it is an expensive investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| What we have found in looking at other areas, Asheville, Greenville, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| they have all made this investment in their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| and what they have found, a direct causal relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| is that people will actually extend their stay and extend their visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| especially to secondary locations within a downtown core that they may not have otherwise known about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| Having this wayfinding system, not only does it make Knoxville have a great image to broadcast to folks who might be visiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| but it also gives us a leg up in terms of tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| and helping people find those secondary destinations that otherwise they may not be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| It also makes it a lot easier for folks to find our parking resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| which we heard was the number one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| and we actually have some specialty design signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| that will actually communicate with the public when a garage is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| So while it is a significant investment, when you purchase quality, you tend to get quality back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| Can we see a mock-up of those signs on our website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Absolutely. They are available at cityofknoxville.org slash wayfinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| We also put a press release out a few months ago highlighting this project in detail and the cost benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| Eric Vreeland put that together, and it's got the images of the signs as well in full color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| Okay, thank you. Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Councilman Dallavepe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Yes, as long as you're there, Ann, you probably know I'm going to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| And I appreciate the usefulness of this wayfinding project in helping our guests and visitors and even residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1153)|
| 0:19:22| get to events efficiently and find directions efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| I'm back to why not three guys in a truck with some sacrete and a little hammer drill to put the nuts on the poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| It's a little bit facetious, but why does it cost so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| What about some council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| We could put them on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| You know, that would drive it down with the pay that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I think it would be less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| But tell me why it's so expensive to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| We did a lot of design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| We had the Philadelphia firm and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Why is it so much to put the signs in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Well, we are actually paying to fabricate all of those signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| to also fabricate blanks that we will keep at the sign shop with city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| so that if and when a sign gets damaged, it's quickly replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| One of the key elements of wayfinding is making sure that you have a trustable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| or a very confident for general user experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| so that if there is a sign that's damaged, it gets quickly replaced and is back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| and the system is continuous and people can get from point A to point B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| We're also dealing with a lot of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Do we do that or do they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| They will be providing the blanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| and our sign shop will be installing and updating them if there's damage over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| But we are working to also remove sign clutter from downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| so as part of this contract, more than 400 signs will be removed from the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| In addition to that, we also have a number of new poles that will be going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and all of those poles require certain foundations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| especially to make sure that wind loads don't inadvertently carry off a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| and cause damage to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Sure, they could be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| There's a lot of elements that go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Obviously, if it was just signs, if it was just standard signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| we would probably take care of that with our sign shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| but we're trying to go the step above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| and really make Knoxville a great place that people can really relate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and understand easily how to get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| And on the positive side, this is a shared cost thing with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| or the Federal Highway Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| We're all taxpayers at every level, but the direct city cost is less than the 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| It's, what, $240,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Correct. Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Well, thank you for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Anne, you mentioned the signs and the poles that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| Is this correct I will not be seeing any of these signs on a utility pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| As a utility pole, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| We will be utilizing some of our existing light poles in coordination with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| and we have worked diligently with them to approve the specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| for that installation so that it doesn't cause delays in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| for their maintenance and servicing of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| So we have worked very closely with KUB in reviewing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| and making sure that the specs won't cause interference with their light poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| But one of the advantages to that is being able to use an existing light pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| helps to reduce the cost and helps to reduce the infrastructure that we're maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| because we already maintain those poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I just was concerned because there are state laws and city ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| that address using utility poles to attach signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| And we seem to have had an epidemic of that in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| so I'm hoping that we're moving in a new direction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| This would just be for light poles, not utility poles that carry electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Yes, Ms. Wallace, I think it might be a good idea for the public to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| I think it's information in our packet when we can look for that to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| As soon as the contract is completed and all of the associated parties sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| we'll issue a notice to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| That's probably typically takes about a month to six weeks to complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| just all of the legal ramifications and signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| And then five months from that point in time, five months from the notice to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| we anticipate the conclusion of the installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| This is an example of another project that Anne, like Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| has been working on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| But you would think it would be simple, but with the source of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| there's so many complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So just kudos to Anne for seeing this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Another few months, five or six months, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I think former Councilman Frost was on council when this began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| Well, it wasn't because Anne and Bob didn't push it every step along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| They pushed it across the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| They pushed it every step along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Let me just say thank you very much for your continued support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| We want to thank our engineering department for their help and support in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Very helpful in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1453)|

| 0:27:07| Just tell us about it because we're all excited about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| that's going to upgrade our trees, and I know we're planting every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| but tell us about this particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Casey Krause, urban forester for the city of Knoxville, 6029 Glen May Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| This is a grant that we've applied for for probably the last four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| It's available from, I think, funds that the state gets from license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| and other agriculture uses throughout the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| and they put this money aside for municipalities apply for just for tree planting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| and last year we, for about the same amount, $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| we went and planted, I think, over 250 trees with the grant funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| and then this year we are planting over 300 with the allocation of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| And we get a $50,000, or I have a $50,000 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| so that budget money actually goes into the grant match for this particular fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| Does the forestry division actually grow tree stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| or they just provide funds to help you implement it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| It's strictly just the funds to plant the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| I actually go out to the nurseries down in McMinnville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| hand-pick the trees, and then plant them just like we do with the rest of our funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| I notice from the schedules attached there that you're trying to mix the species| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| so that we've got more diversity than we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Is that intentional in what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Yes, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| The goal is to try and minimize any species below, I would say, 15% to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| So that if a species gets the flu, the others will do fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Exactly, especially from what we're experiencing with emerald ash borer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| thousand canker disease, and other areas of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| are experiencing with Asian longhorned beetle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| So you don't have all your eggs in one basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Yes, exactly, just like you would with allocating funds for your retirement, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Let's put trees in my portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| I noticed on the location I wanted to commend you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| because you have the location spread out pretty equally around the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| and as far as the installation, does public service do that themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| or do you have to contract that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| We do contract that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| We are with Avalon Lawn Service that does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| and we do plant some when it gets towards the end of planting season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| that weren't under contract to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| We try and supplement some of the planting in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| but most of it's done through contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| As far as the locations go, a lot of these locations were based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| a canopy assessment that we did this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| and we really tried to focus in on those areas which were lacking tree canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| and kind of spread those areas out throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| to where we're not just planting in one general location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| I see. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you. Thank you, Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140805?start=1817)|
