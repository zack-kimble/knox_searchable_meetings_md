| 0:10:12| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=617)|

| 0:10:28| The other no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| On page 11, item number 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| is designating, committing, and procuring funds in the total amount of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| This is resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| I hear a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Motion to approve without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=665)|

| 0:11:08| Motion is before us to approve without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Mr. Chairman, we will send out the amounts in our detail sheet like we normally do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| probably by Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| We just actually got sales tax in Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| so we're finalizing numbers and giving the mayor the information that he needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| to decide his list of designations and commitments to make from FY16 to FY17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=692)|
| 0:11:43| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is probably before us to forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=710)|

| 0:11:58| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Item number 42 is approving an amendment to the redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| of the Center City Redevelopment Project No. 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=723)|

| 0:12:16| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Ms. Bradley seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I'd like to make a substitute motion since City Council hadn't approved this yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| that we pass this with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Substitute motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| We have before us a substitute motion to send no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| Discussion of the motion to send no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| I think one can't happen without the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| One can't happen without the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I don't know whether we move the process forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Did the Windows City Council vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| I guess I'm wanting to discuss the issue and that's okay to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Let's first try to get the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Is this no recommendation or recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| We need to settle that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| If you have a vote, you've closed discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| If it goes with no recommendation, I can't speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I would like to hear that the substitute motion be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=826)|
| 0:13:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| If the substitute motion is withdrawn, we're back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| which is to approve and we can have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| We can still come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| You can come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| You can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| You can still have a substitute motion in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| I withdraw the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| We are discussing the original motion, which is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| I do appreciate Commissioner Smith for letting me speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| I guess this will be my last official vote on a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| I do appreciate this type of TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| This is not a vacant lot next to a really nice facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| This Prior Brown Garage is sorely in need of remodeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| It's a great property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| It's a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| It kind of gets to what I feel, as Mr. Mamatov says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| and Mr. Lyons, if not but for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| This is a perfect example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| So I, one, commend City Council on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| I think this will end up being a really good project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| nothing else because of the location of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| But I'll also, you know, I'll look to Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| City Council and say let's not, let's keep this within a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| You know, I'll go back to Mr. Petrie saying that they're all going to be TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| You know, and I don't want that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| The only way we can do downtown development is a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| That can't be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And no one from city or county said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| That was an individual's thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Okay, so I'm not pinning it on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| But that was uttered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| And I just, one, I don't believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| I'm looking at the prices and I'm looking at the development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| So, you know, I know it takes more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| It takes more to build, to do an infield or to build within an urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| But, you know, this project is a good project to have a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| and I really appreciate the developer taking it on because it's not going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| it's going to be no small task to get this accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| I might ask if Dr. Lyons has anything he would like to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| You may ask, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| Your chance, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| I would be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Commissioner, I very much appreciate your consideration of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Again, this process did include the further due diligence of having the third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| and we concur with what Commissioner McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| This is a very critical structure in a very critical area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| and we think we're very much strongly in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| and appreciate the developers' efforts on what has been a very challenging project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| One quick question for those who didn't get to read the results, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| Was it an overwhelming grade A, or are we in the middle on passing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| You're talking about the third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Basically, and I will let, if you want, I will have the folks from KCDC get into detail if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| but basically they first determined that the project needed to have a gap closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| that it couldn't take place without it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| and then they also concurred that the amount requested was appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| given all of the proformas associated with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| And that's pretty much, I guess, would be how I would summarize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| But I'd be glad, you know, anyway, specific questions I'd be glad to answer or let the folks at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| I just wanted to get that part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Yes, the third-party review did say that going forward with the TIF was appropriate given the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1067)|
| 0:17:57| Commissioner Smith, were you wanting to speak after Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I just wanted to say that the only reason why I wanted to put this off was out of respect for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| since this property is in the city and was brought to us by KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| I just wanted to see if Mr. Cohen wanted to say anything since he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| Mr. Dover, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| He can say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| Good evening, Commissioner. I'm Rick Dover, Dover Development, 4921 Harmburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| I just wanted to thank you for considering this and just put in my two cents worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| that I did feel that the mini-cap review was a worthwhile endeavor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and fresh eyes from different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| At the time, I was certainly open to being taught something new on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| If there was a better way to skin the cat, as it turned out, there wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| But at least we kind of knew what the options were and got their review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| which was supportive of the request and that the assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| and the development path was deemed reasonable by the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I felt somewhat comforted by that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| I don't really have anything to add unless you have specific questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Not a question for Mr. Dover, but Commissioner Smith brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| Are we stepping on the council's toes by jumping ahead of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I think that's your question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| What do you think, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| I think we do appreciate that consideration, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| I don't think so in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I believe that we have been very clear that this needs to go to both bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| and we appreciate the willingness to have deference to the council vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| but I don't think that's anything that would be bothersome to council at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| if commission considered it would be my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| If you could pass that information to them, I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| I don't think this would be seen as any kind of breach of protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I mean, actually, at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| we took these to whichever body happened to appear first given the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and a couple of times it was commissioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| and it was actually a couple of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| and we appreciate it took the initiative to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| to bring up the point that Commissioner Smith did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| that should we defer to the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| but that was never anything that council had ever expressed any dissatisfaction with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Now, those are different council people at different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| but as a body there hasn't been any history of an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| that commission would demur until council voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| This afternoon I read the report from UNICAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| and have looked at the highlights again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| and this third-party report is excellent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and I'm very happy that we're doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| It just brings it all in perspective on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| and this is going to work, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| And I want to, again, and we've made this, I've said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| thank you to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| I mean, really, it was your initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| and I think it's been something that its time had come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| and I appreciate your kind of bringing it to the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| and bringing this so we can establish this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| I think it has worked well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| and we are happy to see that level of examination of the financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| that even though we could do some, we couldn't do it at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| and we couldn't do it as dispassionately as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Seeing none, the motion before us is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Mr. Caldwell, the ASPA is not here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1337)|
| 0:22:30| I'm sorry, I did not speak to you of this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| No, I don't believe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| We'll see you Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| I knew you'd be here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Madam Clerk, could you look at item 51, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| This is on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Item 51, motion and vote of the commission to mandate that the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| call a special session of the commission on September 2016 act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| in the main assembly room of the city-county building for the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| of reorganizing the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| making appointments to various boards and committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| electing officers to the commission's standing committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| to spread of record officials' bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| The reason this is here is to help us to set the day for reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1393)|
| 0:23:22| As has been discussed earlier, September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| swearing-in day did not work for all members that would be sworn in to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| available for swearing-in and reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| We will have swearing-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| When will we have reorganization is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Do I hear dates that have been offered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| September the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| The 8th was thrown out last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Was it thrown out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| No, I mean it was put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| And that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| September the 8th at 9 a.m. has been offered as a time and place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Since the other candidates that have been elected are here, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| should we at least ask them if they're available that date as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| You're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| You're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Ms. Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| The 8th is good for her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Thursday the 8th is good for you for reappointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| We're good in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Now then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Because of the MPC meeting in here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| It has to be prior to basically 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| They meet him here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| I'm going to recognize Mr. Grider, relations out of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| Some discussion has been made of the mayor hosting a breakfast thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| Would that fit on that day or do we need to also discuss other days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| I believe that you said we're talking about the 8th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| That's correct, the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| And the reason that I raise this is since Mayor Burchett is offering to have a recognition morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| with the mayor for commission, this would allow us to have a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| If we could have the mayor's thing and the reorganization at the same time and date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Looking at the calendar, it looks like the 8th would work for the mayor's calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| and he'd like to host the commission for breakfast that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Then to go along with that, now I'm looking for a threefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Stay with me, stay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Looking for orientation of some issues, would that be a day that could fit for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| And also I need to bring into this then the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| Continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Yeah, I think without having talked to the mayor's senior staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| I think that we should be able to get our senior directors or at least some of their top staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| to come to an orientation type event that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Okay, so what we're going to have is a breakfast hosted by the mayor, reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| and then some orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Does that agree with everyone so far for the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| Mr. Law Director, there are important considerations in being a member of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| which concerns such things as public notice, sun shining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| and other items of discussion in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| Would that be a day also that you might be able to address the incoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| and current members of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| We'll prepare something related to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| and probably some of the significant commission rules and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Mr. Grider, did I commit you to 830 or 9 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| 830 might work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Okay, breakfast at 830?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Okay, now if you've been making notes, we're talking of reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| We're speaking of breakfast provided by the mayor, reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| orientation of some directors directed toward new members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| and also the law department, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| giving some vital guidelines on how commission works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| that being September the 8th beginning at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| Do I hear other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| He said he's going to come for the breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| I've got a question on one of the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| According to the sheet we have here, it says on the Safety Center Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| the chairman appointment expires in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Number one, I had the ladies in the clerk's office go back and research those minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1701)|
| 0:28:29| There wasn't anything in there that put a time limit on it, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| And number two, while the four of us were appointed to that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| the committee itself elected the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| And to my knowledge, that did not have to be ratified by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| as far as the chairmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| So I intend to stay with the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| If you get any heartburn over that, you might as well just name the chairman again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| I have recollection of the committee being appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| I do not remember whether or not membership of the commission followed making the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1752)|
| 0:29:23| This is something we need to get discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| We'll add this as a discussion item to make sure it's handled at the meeting Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| But continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| That committee operates independently of the commission but reports to the commission its findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1773)|
| 0:29:44| The commission does not have any ruling authority over that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1784)|
| 0:29:55| The chairman's appointment, I think he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| You're working for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Anyway, you need to squire that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| You're raising that as a discussion item for next Monday's meeting, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| Yes, you can put it as a discussion item and we'll deal with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| Your insurance still stops in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Your insurance still stops in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| But I did have the ladies go back and search those minutes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1828)|
| 0:30:39| I was looking to see, I've seen Carson Daly, Michelle Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1839)|
| 0:30:50| Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Is Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I do not see Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| You understand the motion that is before us is to have reorganization, breakfast, orientation, and speeches by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1860)|
| 0:31:12| September the 8th, beginning at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you wish to speak to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Are you going to do then the meeting at 930 to elect the chairman and vice chairman since the Knox County clerk has to preside over that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| Hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| You need to set a time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| We'll be doing it at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Breakfast at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| The reorganization is at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Just clarifying so that he'll know when to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| Reorganization is at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| Discussion item that we have before us is the expiration of the BZA terms on September 30th of District 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1922)|
| 0:32:20| It is normal, I think, for the commission member of that district to bring forward a nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1940)|
| 0:32:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Daniel in the law department sent a letter, and he copied my successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| And I've spoken with her, and I want her to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| So it will occur on or after September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| We will have to have on next commission's agenda this resolution making such appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I talked to Carson, and I worked this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| He has a name we have mutually agreed on, but we could put up this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| But if we do, I'm not sure when the other appointments end, but his appointment ends in September 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| So if we appointed him this month, he'd have to turn around and reappoint next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| So next month would be the time to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| In the September meeting of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Which is prior to the BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| And it fits the calendar also then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| As far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker is saying that would be before the next meeting of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| It should be the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| They'd be appointed like two days before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| He might just have to cancel the meeting for that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| That's Commissioner Ornby or Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| He's not really here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| No, the light's out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| He matched your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Oh, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Yes, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| This is a question, I guess, for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| I have spoken with Dennis, and Dennis, the business he is in has picked up considerably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| and he doesn't wish to serve any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| If I cannot find somebody in the next few days in order to get something on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| can his term continue until we find a replacement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2074)|
| 0:34:48| You'd have to appoint him and he'd resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| You could appoint him and he'd resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Is that the only way you could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| His term expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| I think you'd create a vacancy, and then you'd have to appoint somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| That's the way it would normally be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| When your term expires, then it expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Usually you fulfill until your successor is sworn in, but usually you have a named successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| He's willing to serve until I can find someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| Let me look at it, and I'll let you know Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| When is his term up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| September 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| What is September 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| It's not a paying job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| They serve the September meeting, and then they're new in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Then it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| So we're okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Do I hear a motion to defer line items to Monday meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I have a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Motion is properly before us to defer line items to the next meeting, to the regular stated meeting of County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Do we have any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| I don't think we've got other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| We've got announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Do we have announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| You should have received in the mail, and I think Ms. Jolie today did send out the public notice for September 9th at noon at the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| They're having the annual government and business luncheon to kind of kick off the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160815?start=2198)|
