| 2:54:48| Mr. Dupler, you can help navigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| All right, so Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Just a point of order or process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| Are we going to vote on one and then come right back and immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10503)|
| 2:55:15| We're not going to take a recess or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| What we were going to do, I think what they're suggesting is if the substitute motion passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10517)|
| 2:55:24| then the original motion is no longer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10524)|
| 2:55:28| and then we could take a break and come back and discuss the two separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| Yeah, but they asked do they not want two votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10533)|
| 2:55:39| Is that what they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| Right, after the substitute motion to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10540)|
| 2:55:44| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| We're going to take a break in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| I don't know that you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| That's why I asked about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| I'm sorry, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| So as I understand it, Mr. McMillan, so there's a motion to approve the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| and now there's a substitute motion to basically do away with that first motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10565)|
| 2:56:11| and break it into two votes on the two concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| So that's what you've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| If somebody wants to make an amendment, well, you can't make another substitute, so we can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10580)|
| 2:56:29| But that's what's on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10589)|
| 2:56:32| And the question is, if the substitute passes, of course if it doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| then you're right back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| But if it passes, then now you're left with, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| now you need to make motions to approve the two concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10603)|
| 2:56:53| But you're going to take a break between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| I'm not taking a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| I think that's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| I'm not going to vote for that because I don't think it's right process-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10621)|
| 2:57:09| It's not that I oppose what they're trying to do or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| although I'm not going to support the original one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10635)|
| 2:57:20| I just don't think that that is the way it should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10640)|
| 2:57:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| In my motion, I'm not asking for a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| I'm simply asking for it to be split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| Okay, we can split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10654)|
| 2:57:35| We cannot have the recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| Why don't you just withdraw the original motion and then let him make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10657)|
| 2:57:45| I'm trying to clarify my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10667)|
| 2:57:48| I never asked for a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| I think that's up to you to decide if we're going to have a recess or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10669)|
| 2:57:52| Yeah, we have several board members requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| All I'm asking is to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| Yeah, and I mean, to me, that's not a part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| The recess is not a part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| The motion is simply to split the two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| I was just trying to get clarification for those board members desperately needing a short break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10682)|
| 2:58:09| It might be staff members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10690)|
| 2:58:11| So we're going with the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10691)|
| 2:58:17| So we have a substitute motion and a second to split the two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10697)|
| 2:58:27| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10711)|
| 2:58:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10712)|
| 2:58:33| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10713)|
| 2:58:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10714)|
| 2:58:35| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10716)|
| 2:58:37| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10717)|
| 2:58:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10718)|
| 2:58:39| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10719)|
| 2:58:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10723)|
| 2:58:44| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10724)|
| 2:58:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10725)|
| 2:58:46| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10726)|
| 2:58:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10727)|
| 2:58:50| That's six yes votes, two no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| Dr. Butler, did you want to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| You don't want to change it or you want to vote no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10741)|
| 2:59:02| So that's six yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| So the motion to split the two carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| So, Mr. Dupler, currently there's no motion on the floor, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10752)|
| 2:59:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| In your legal opinion, if board members needed a short break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10762)|
| 2:59:27| would it be inappropriate to take one right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| Just let me talk about that just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| because I believe Mr. McMillan's concern is that there might be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| discussion during a short break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| and I would advise all members of this board to not discuss anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10779)|
| 2:59:45| what's currently before this board during the short break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| Other than that, there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| From what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| discussion is not what they're thinking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| So we will take a ten-minute short break because people are desperately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10796)|
| 3:00:02| needing that, and we will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| So we are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| Mr. Watson, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10807)|
| 3:00:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| I'd like to make a motion to approve the data sharing element of the MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10812)|
| 3:00:19| with Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| So we have a motion to approve the data sharing MOU and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10824)|
| 3:00:28| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| Mr. Dupler, I'm looking at the MOU on page 5, number 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10833)|
| 3:00:43| and I'd just like some clarification here where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| relationship of parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| The relationship contemplated herein is that of independent contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| Nothing herein shall in any way be construed or intended to create a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| partnership or joint venture between the parties hereto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| So that would apply to our data sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| and if we look at the best part, that would apply to both, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10867)|
| 3:01:14| So, Ms. Owen, you're looking at the alternative MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10874)|
| 3:01:22| that was provided this evening, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10884)|
| 3:01:25| So that only applies to the data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| There's no fund expenditure with the data sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| so we can say that on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| The original MOU does not have that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10898)|
| 3:01:43| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| Thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| and I appreciate that we're speaking specifically about the data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| agreement, but I do want to understand the language of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| So just to be clear, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| the reason that type of language was not in the original MOU is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| that type of language can't be used when there's some in-kind transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10921)|
| 3:02:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| This district has data sharing agreements with various third parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10928)|
| 3:02:12| and there is no relationship other than an independent contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| Just a quick question for Dr. Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| Do we share data with other, I mean, if this data sharing should pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| do we have MOUs with other, like Emerald or Thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| any of those other organizations that are not school-related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| I just know because I talked to Steve Rutter today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| I could go to you, Corey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| So we did ask that question just to kind of say there is confirmation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| there are other ones that exist with some other nonprofits in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| And this is sort of on the subject but off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| Will this also open the door for transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| Should that pass as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10974)|
| 3:02:55| I mean, does that create a situation where that becomes an open door that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| would be a challenge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| I don't know if that's also for you, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| I'll take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10985)|
| 3:03:06| So maybe I'll answer the question this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| I'll try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| I'm not doing a very good job of answering questions tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| so make sure I don't forget them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| So I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10994)|
| 3:03:15| We did talk with Mr. Dillingham to ask if there are other existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| transportation agreements with other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| and the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11003)|
| 3:03:24| There are ones, and Dr. Adams, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| there are ones where they pay for the contracted, you know, the buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11007)|
| 3:03:32| but there aren't any that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| And some that there are agreements through like a community school and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| Knox Ed Foundation or something like that who pays for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| But there's not one that Knox County School pays for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| So if you're asking, I would compare the two questions you just asked me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| say, the data sharing, yes, we do have existing other MOUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| but as far as transportation being provided at Knox County's cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| we're not aware of these in talking to Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11037)|
| 3:04:02| I have the same questions as Mr. Triplett about our other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11042)|
| 3:04:06| Do we have the MOUs with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| Because I think all of these organizations do great work, Thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| We've got Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11051)|
| 3:04:12| We've got Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| I just think my other concerns, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| are just the lack of the KCS oversight breaking the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| I have a real concern about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11060)|
| 3:04:22| and I'm just also concerned about some of the national groups behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11062)|
| 3:04:25| organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11065)|
| 3:04:26| and I just think that they should probably go through the normal facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| use process just like any of our other groups may go through that some of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11070)|
| 3:04:33| agree with, some of us don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| So that's why I'll be voting no on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11075)|
| 3:04:40| Ms. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11080)|
| 3:04:41| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| We are just talking about the data sharing right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11090)|
| 3:04:51| So we have a motion on the floor to approve the data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11091)|
| 3:04:58| Mr. Duport, are we approving this MOU you handed out tonight for the data sharing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11098)|
| 3:05:06| So the motion is more generic to approve the data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11106)|
| 3:05:12| I mean, certainly I would recommend that if this board only adopt the data sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11112)|
| 3:05:18| that you use the alternative agreement which has been handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11118)|
| 3:05:25| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11128)|
| 3:05:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11129)|
| 3:05:30| The reason I made it generic is because should the transportation also be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11130)|
| 3:05:34| if both of them should be approved, then they should be in the form of one MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| So I didn't want to get the cart before the horse and approve the means before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11138)|
| 3:05:43| approved the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| So obviously if the data sharing gets approved and the transportation does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11145)|
| 3:05:51| and needs to live in an MOU, Mr. Duport has already wrote an MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| so I would think that would be where it would land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| But I didn't want to hold us to an MOU on data sharing that's separate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11158)|
| 3:06:03| transportation should transportation also be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| And I say that as if I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| I'm just saying in the event of, it gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11169)|
| 3:06:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11173)|
| 3:06:14| Ms. Horne, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11174)|
| 3:06:15| Yes, good to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11177)|
| 3:06:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11178)|
| 3:06:19| A question on, or maybe just a clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| I just want to make sure I'm reading this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| On the first page on number three it says request for student data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| And this would be, so basically the parent would have to sign off prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11186)|
| 3:06:32| any data being shared with the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11195)|
| 3:06:36| That's correct, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11196)|
| 3:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11197)|
| 3:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| River Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| I just want to make sure I'm understanding that if we pass this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11203)|
| 3:06:51| sharing as an MOU, then the state law for the list of books or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11211)|
| 3:07:06| curriculum would not apply, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11226)|
| 3:07:12| That's my understanding, River Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| the best understanding that we have as far as the state law is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11238)|
| 3:07:19| So those materials is not an issue in terms of data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11239)|
| 3:07:25| All the data sharing does is allow the school to give them more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11245)|
| 3:07:32| to do a better job of maintaining literacy over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11252)|
| 3:07:38| So it's not in any way based on what we've discussed previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11258)|
| 3:07:43| promoting the program, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| It's simply helping them to do a better job with the students that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11269)|
| 3:07:50| And it is parents have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11270)|
| 3:07:55| And it's a parent's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| Parents choose to come to the school with that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11277)|
| 3:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11283)|
| 3:08:07| Ms. Sutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| I would say that this data sharing agreement is much clearer than a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11289)|
| 3:08:16| the data sharing agreements that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| Most of the software agreements that we have looked at all throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11298)|
| 3:08:24| year, most of those have a data sharing component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11304)|
| 3:08:28| Most of the contracts we have with any kind of vendor that has any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11308)|
| 3:08:36| data like that, student data, most of those have some kind of data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11316)|
| 3:08:41| component like Pearson, Aimsweb, all those, so that they can look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| data, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11326)|
| 3:08:47| So that's just my point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| And Dr. Reislich, if I could ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| So when this whole discussion of this MOU came up, what was asked of us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11333)|
| 3:09:01| through the discussion, what did KCS offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11341)|
| 3:09:08| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| I was not in that conversation, so I'm going to tell you what I think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| And I think Ms. Dean kind of expressed some of that, too, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| My understanding was that the original conversation was around the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| sharing, the possibility of expanding the program, and then the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11361)|
| 3:09:28| about transportation came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| It was my understanding, too, and again, Ms. Dean probably knows more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| that than I do because she was in the conversation, but it was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| understanding that there was not an ask of Freedom Schools for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| transportation, but the staff had conversation at that point talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| through that, and that was offered and agreed to be put in the MOU for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11386)|
| 3:09:47| So basically, our staff, through the discussion of the data sharing, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11387)|
| 3:09:52| staff somewhere along the way seems to have said, oh, and hey, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11392)|
| 3:09:57| some buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11397)|
| 3:09:58| I think, yes, and again, Ms. Dean could probably answer that better than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11398)|
| 3:10:02| I could, but I think it came up as, you can, Ms. Dean, please, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11402)|
| 3:10:05| don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11405)|
| 3:10:06| I think that the conversation, I don't think that was their ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11406)|
| 3:10:10| I think it came up as the discussing barriers on growing the program, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11410)|
| 3:10:14| the staff made the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11414)|
| 3:10:15| So I don't want to speak for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11415)|
| 3:10:16| You didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11417)|
| 3:10:18| You didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11418)|
| 3:10:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11419)|
| 3:10:20| I mean, we're having a general conversation about the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11420)|
| 3:10:21| between Knox County Schools and Freedom Schools and how we benefit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| students that you are deemed, you know, you're in charge of serving, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| when we talked about all the things, we talked about there's lots more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| children that we could serve, and so we talked about expanding in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| of sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11432)|
| 3:10:33| We talked about data sharing because we tried that a few years ago, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| at that point you were doing, there was more of a focus on fluency versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| So since we focus on comprehension, it's just become available for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| do that comparison to see if, in fact, Freedom Schools is having the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11444)|
| 3:10:48| we want to have when they return in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11448)|
| 3:10:50| And as we were talking about some of the challenges, transportation came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| That's a barrier for many families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11454)|
| 3:10:55| And they said, well, you know, we're going to the same schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| That's how it kind of evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| So it sounds like we have almost made an offer that …| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11460)|
| 3:11:05| It was a joint conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| I mean, it happened in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| I don't think they said, hey, you want to get on our buses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| I don't think it was quite that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| But we wanted to explore what was possible in terms of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11474)|
| 3:11:18| transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11478)|
| 3:11:19| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11479)|
| 3:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| I have little experience with the data sharing component with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| The organization that I get to steward in the Restoration House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| partners and has an MOU with Emerald Youth Foundation, and Emerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| Youth has had a data sharing agreement since at least 2015, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11497)|
| 3:11:41| when we started working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| And to Reverend Butler's concern, I'm fairly confident that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11503)|
| 3:11:50| not been asked to qualify their curriculum since this state law has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11510)|
| 3:11:55| taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| So being that they do have a data sharing agreement and they have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| been asked to do that, nor do I think any other data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| institution that we work with or relationship that we have has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| asked that, I do think it, I think, Mr. Dupler, I'm not, I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| know more about this than me, but I'm also saying from a common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| perspective and seeing what's actually happening out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11535)|
| 3:12:19| this doesn't seem to have tripped any issues for those organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| that have, that are already using data sharing agreements with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11547)|
| 3:12:33| All right, so Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| I think to address the question or the statement that was made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| in MOU we're not promoting them, I think by definition an MOU is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| formal partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| And right in the text it says that we're a partner, right in the MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11567)|
| 3:12:51| language, and so I just think lots of these organizations do great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11571)|
| 3:12:56| They, again, have a right to use our facilities, but I also want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| treat all of them equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| This seems to be the one that we're focusing on, but also using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11581)|
| 3:13:04| taxpayer resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11584)|
| 3:13:06| While I've heard from people on both sides, we're using taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| resources for a program that a lot of people are really concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11589)|
| 3:13:14| And, again, back to the national organization, you know, I've found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| something that in 2019 they had a podcast saying that they, one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11598)|
| 3:13:25| their main priorities for Tennessee was to raise activists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11605)|
| 3:13:30| I don't know, to me, our job is to educate our kids, not to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| activists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11612)|
| 3:13:34| So that's why I have a problem with the fact that this is MOU, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| is a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11617)|
| 3:13:46| I'm just going to remind everyone again, it's really difficult for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| to hear when we have distractions in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| In the spirit of treating everybody equally, what I'm hearing, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11637)|
| 3:14:01| Razek, is that we have memorandums of understanding with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11641)|
| 3:14:06| organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11648)|
| 3:14:10| Thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| And I don't know if Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| Lautner, if you would like to speak to that, I'll let you speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| We do have data sharing agreements with other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11662)|
| 3:14:26| And to the question that was asked previously as to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| that opens the door for transportation requests, to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| knowledge, that has never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| So that is just a back and forth of whatever data has been requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11674)|
| 3:14:38| and agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| It is true that we are currently in the process of looking at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| it would mean to expand access to more data sharing agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| So as of right now, we are taking those requests as they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| And so if a partner has not made that request, then we've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| necessarily offered that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| So when a request is made, we look into what it would take to process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11697)|
| 3:15:01| that request and make it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| So they do have data agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| Other partners do have data sharing agreements with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11706)|
| 3:15:09| And they are called partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11709)|
| 3:15:11| Whether or not we analyze their?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11711)|
| 3:15:17| I probably should clarify that I have not read every single one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11717)|
| 3:15:22| those MOUs, so I wouldn't want to speak to whether or not we formally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| refer to them as partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| I did just refer to them as partners, but I don't know contractually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| speaking what that language looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| Yeah, and I, you know, I think that if we want to treat everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11733)|
| 3:15:38| equally, let's treat everybody equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| I think what I'm looking at here is you have an organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11742)|
| 3:15:50| has been working with children in Knox County, in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11750)|
| 3:15:57| in District 1 and District 2 schools for several years, have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11757)|
| 3:16:05| wonderful track record, both in terms of database success and parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11765)|
| 3:16:15| satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| And then they're saying, hey, let's see if we can get data from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11776)|
| 3:16:22| Knox County schools to make sure that we're doing what the measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11782)|
| 3:16:27| we got are accurate and we can do the best job we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| So that's what I'm looking at here, that East Tennessee Freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11791)|
| 3:16:37| Schools, that's what they've asked, that's what they came asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| And the conversation transportation came up, but what they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| was asking for is we want to do a better job in working for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11805)|
| 3:16:51| kids during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| So I think that's the data agreement here, it's not anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11813)|
| 3:16:59| that I see, but that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11819)|
| 3:17:04| Ms. Ellen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11824)|
| 3:17:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11827)|
| 3:17:08| We're just talking about the agreement right now, not the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11831)|
| 3:17:15| The data sharing agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11835)|
| 3:17:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11836)|
| 3:17:17| So that, I mean, this isn't an MOU, it just says data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11837)|
| 3:17:22| agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11842)|
| 3:17:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| And Mr. Watson said he left it intentionally vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| Correct, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11850)|
| 3:17:31| Is that what your motion was to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| That's true, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| I don't think we know what the final form will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| My presumption is that it would look very similar to the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11859)|
| 3:17:42| that's been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11862)|
| 3:17:45| And in that agreement there is line 23, I do appreciate Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11865)|
| 3:17:50| Lautner speaking about, she said partner, but she's not speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| from a legal standpoint, that point 23 in this, should this be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11873)|
| 3:17:57| the final form, does say that it actually in fact does not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| a partnership or a joint venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| So I understand that we may feel like it's a partnership, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11883)|
| 3:18:07| legally speaking it would not be a partnership if this form is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11887)|
| 3:18:12| used, which I would presume that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| It should get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11894)|
| 3:18:22| I think Corey answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11902)|
| 3:18:23| I just wanted to clarify that an MOU and the data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11903)|
| 3:18:26| agreement are two totally different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| So we have data, I mean, whoever can answer that, I'm not trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11909)|
| 3:18:32| to put you on the spot, Corey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| So we have data sharing agreements with the other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11914)|
| 3:18:39| not an MOU, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11919)|
| 3:18:42| Well, I would probably defer to Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| I imagine we do have MOUs that also include a data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11924)|
| 3:18:48| component, but we also have data agreements that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11928)|
| 3:18:53| separate from MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11933)|
| 3:18:56| So it might be a both end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| So most if not all of the data sharing agreements call for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11939)|
| 3:19:07| independent contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11947)|
| 3:19:08| They do not call, that is a legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11948)|
| 3:19:11| It's not a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| You know, a partner has legal connotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| So there are various types of MOUs, and as Ms. Lautner said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11956)|
| 3:19:24| I mean, some of them do include data sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11964)|
| 3:19:29| some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| There's a lot of software, as Ms. Owen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| and all those software ones, I guarantee you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11973)|
| 3:19:36| say independent contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| So again, I mean, Mr. Watson's kind of made this motion a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11978)|
| 3:19:43| little bit vague, but if this board does adopt the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11983)|
| 3:19:49| sharing agreement, then it's clear that you all still will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11989)|
| 3:19:55| independent contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=11997)|
| 3:20:06| Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12006)|
| 3:20:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12007)|
| 3:20:08| I have another question for Mr. Dupler, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12008)|
| 3:20:11| Mr. Dupler, so back to Mr. Watson's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| should both of these issues pass, would the document then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12015)|
| 3:20:20| would it be the original document that is attached to our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12020)|
| 3:20:24| or would it be two separate documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12024)|
| 3:20:27| All I can discuss right now is the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12027)|
| 3:20:33| I don't know if the second motion is going to ask for the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12033)|
| 3:20:38| because right now you're just asking for data sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12042)|
| 3:20:43| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12043)|
| 3:20:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| We have a call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| and the motion was for to approve the data sharing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12050)|
| 3:20:55| Is that what, Ms. Coatney, was that the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12055)|
| 3:21:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| My motion was to agree the data sharing element of the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12063)|
| 3:21:08| not the final form of the MOU itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12068)|
| 3:21:14| And I know we have, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| technically if we need to vote for the call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| that's fine, but I do have a technical question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12081)|
| 3:21:22| The reason I was doing that was to try to save effort should both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| Mr. Dupler, if I am in my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12086)|
| 3:21:30| I don't know if I can, if I can, and it can be seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| And I asked for the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| Is it an issue legally for them to have a separate data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12094)|
| 3:21:41| agreement from an MOU that involves transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| I'm trying to not have it where it would have two documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| if they should both get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12106)|
| 3:21:52| It might be simpler just to do two documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| I think the motion itself has honestly created a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12115)|
| 3:22:00| confusion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| There I go trying to be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| And now you've got a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12123)|
| 3:22:07| So the board is going to have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12127)|
| 3:22:10| Oh, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12132)|
| 3:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12133)|
| 3:22:14| So we don't have a second on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| So if you want to try to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| I would like to amend my motion to approve the data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12139)|
| 3:22:25| agreement that's been presented by Mr. Dupler in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12145)|
| 3:22:31| And Ms. Owen, you were a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| So with that, can we go to Mr. McMillan's call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12153)|
| 3:22:38| Or do we, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| Can I second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12162)|
| 3:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12163)|
| 3:22:44| I will second Mr. McMillan's call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12164)|
| 3:22:48| And we will vote on calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| We are voting on calling for the question now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12170)|
| 3:22:53| Ms. Cooney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12179)|
| 3:23:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12180)|
| 3:23:01| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12181)|
| 3:23:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12182)|
| 3:23:03| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12183)|
| 3:23:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12184)|
| 3:23:05| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12186)|
| 3:23:07| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12189)|
| 3:23:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12190)|
| 3:23:11| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12191)|
| 3:23:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12192)|
| 3:23:13| With that motion, we are the motion to approve the data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12193)|
| 3:23:17| agreement that was presented by Mr. Watson and seconded by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12197)|
| 3:23:21| Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12201)|
| 3:23:25| Ms. Cooney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12207)|
| 3:23:32| The motion is to approve the data sharing agreement that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| provided by Mr. Dupler this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12215)|
| 3:23:37| And it was seconded by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| So this is a roll call vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12218)|
| 3:23:41| Can I have a comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| The question was called for in that past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12225)|
| 3:23:46| I missed all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12226)|
| 3:23:50| It's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12233)|
| 3:23:54| We'll read the motion again, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| So we are voting on approving the data sharing agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| Mr. Dupler gave us prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| It was made by Mr. Watson and seconded by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12252)|
| 3:24:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| We voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| That was what we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12258)|
| 3:24:22| That was the last vote was calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12262)|
| 3:24:25| I think discussion was done anyway, though, so I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12265)|
| 3:24:30| I was just saying that the question was called before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| motion was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| The question was called after the motion was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| And we just voted on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12279)|
| 3:24:44| The agreement, the data sharing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12284)|
| 3:24:49| So now we're voting on the data sharing agreement that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12295)|
| 3:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12298)|
| 3:24:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12299)|

| 3:25:10| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12310)|
| 3:25:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12311)|

| 3:25:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12313)|
| 3:25:14| That's six yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12314)|
| 3:25:15| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12318)|
| 3:25:19| So, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| I would like to make a motion to approve the transportation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| or MOU, I guess that's the form it's in, minus the data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12327)|
| 3:25:32| component that's within it with Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12332)|
| 3:25:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12341)|
| 3:25:42| So we have a motion for the transportation piece of the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| And I have a technical question about my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| I want to make, because I feel like I got unintentionally played| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12347)|
| 3:25:50| like this about two years ago related to something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12350)|
| 3:25:53| I want to make sure that by me stripping it, and if it passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| that I didn't also devoid what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12356)|
| 3:26:00| So I'm not saying I intentionally got played,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12360)|
| 3:26:03| but I want to make sure that that's real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12366)|
| 3:26:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| And Mr. Watson, as I understand your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12369)|
| 3:26:12| you want to keep the MOU intact except for the data sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12372)|
| 3:26:17| which is now a separate agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12380)|
| 3:26:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12381)|
| 3:26:22| Yeah, that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12382)|
| 3:26:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12383)|
| 3:26:24| So we have a motion for the MOU with the transportation piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12384)|
| 3:26:27| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12387)|
| 3:26:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12388)|
| 3:26:29| And we have a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12389)|
| 3:26:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12396)|
| 3:26:37| So, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12397)|
| 3:26:38| So just to make sure I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12398)|
| 3:26:44| so this is the one that has the issue about the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12404)|
| 3:26:50| and that we have to comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| I think it was Dr. Susan, is it Gronk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12413)|
| 3:26:59| Grinky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12419)|
| 3:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12420)|
| 3:27:02| That you talked about the Freedom School already has a curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12422)|
| 3:27:06| examination process that is rigorous and consistent with what the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12426)|
| 3:27:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12433)|
| 3:27:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12434)|
| 3:27:15| Is it appropriate for me to ask her to explain that again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12435)|
| 3:27:19| You can ask her to come up to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| Will you come up and explain that and also talk about the relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12441)|
| 3:27:25| I think you stated, that you all have with the Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| but just that portion that you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12449)|
| 3:27:34| So I was a curriculum writer for the Freedom Schools for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12454)|
| 3:27:41| and I was asked to write curriculum that was rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12461)|
| 3:27:46| I was asked to write curriculum that was standards-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| and age-appropriate, using multicultural children's literature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12469)|
| 3:27:56| that is vetted every year by a committee of school media specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12476)|
| 3:28:02| university professors, members that sit on the Scott King Book Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12482)|
| 3:28:09| Committee, which is an American Library Association book award committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| The curriculum is structured around the theme of I can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12494)|
| 3:28:23| And so each book is vetted to ensure that it fits that theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12503)|
| 3:28:29| and that it encourages young people to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12509)|
| 3:28:32| through the reading of multicultural literature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12512)|
| 3:28:37| it encourages them to think about how can I apply this to my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12517)|
| 3:28:41| and think about how I can make a difference in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| in the life of my community, in my family, and in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12524)|
| 3:28:50| The curriculum, so for each book, when I would write that curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12530)|
| 3:28:55| I would read the books that were selected multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12535)|
| 3:29:00| I would read the state standards multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12540)|
| 3:29:05| I would keep this in mind about this theme of making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12545)|
| 3:29:09| And each book has a week's worth of scripted lessons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12549)|
| 3:29:16| that start with a pre-reading activity, a during reading activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12556)|
| 3:29:21| and a post-reading activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| These activities are aligned with state reading standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| They focus on reading comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12568)|
| 3:29:31| Instructors are trained to ask questions about the key details of the text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12571)|
| 3:29:36| the main ideas of the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| They're asked to ask discussion questions about the characters in the text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12578)|
| 3:29:44| about the plot, symbolism, the settings, the theme, author, craft, tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12584)|
| 3:29:52| All of these things are standards that I train our beginning English teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12592)|
| 3:29:57| at the University of Tennessee to be able to implement when they are out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12597)|
| 3:30:02| which they do a year-long field experience in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12602)|
| 3:30:07| We're very proud of that partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| We've been doing that for almost 20 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| And we have about a 99% job hire rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12611)|
| 3:30:15| Most of our students who graduate from our internship program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12615)|
| 3:30:19| get hired by Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| A lot of our students have become teachers and department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12621)|
| 3:30:25| literacy coaches, and literacy leaders in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12625)|
| 3:30:31| And as I said earlier, I've had to become very, very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12631)|
| 3:30:35| with the Tennessee law on prohibitive concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| We have a similar law in higher education on divisive concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| So we're talking about this as university faculty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12642)|
| 3:30:45| We are working with our legal counsel at the university level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12645)|
| 3:30:49| to make sure that we are within the language of the law in the curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| that we use on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| And that translates to making sure we are in the language of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12654)|
| 3:30:59| when we are working with beginning teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12659)|
| 3:31:02| that we know are going to serve the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12662)|
| 3:31:05| So, yes, I can vouch from having written that curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12665)|
| 3:31:08| that it is within the language of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12668)|
| 3:31:13| So does that answer your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| Yes, but also do you have documentation of that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12675)|
| 3:31:20| Of the process that I've gone through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| That you just explained for Freedom Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12682)|
| 3:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| And would Freedom Schools be willing to share that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12687)|
| 3:31:31| and the experts or the professionals, the committee that did the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12691)|
| 3:31:38| and what the findings were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| I can speak for Mrs. Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12701)|
| 3:31:44| I speak on behalf of Mrs. Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12704)|
| 3:31:46| But I would be happy to share that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| and talk through that process, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12708)|
| 3:31:51| Mrs. Dean, would you be willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12711)|
| 3:31:54| Sure. She's more expert on that part than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12714)|
| 3:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| And so thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12718)|
| 3:32:01| And the reason why I asked those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| was because there is a concern, and I have a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12723)|
| 3:32:07| that we follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| That's one of the requirements that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12729)|
| 3:32:16| One of the things that I learned in the orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| that I first had with our chairperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| and then also with the Tennessee State School Board Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12743)|
| 3:32:29| was that one of the things we have to do is follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12749)|
| 3:32:34| follow federal and state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| and follow federal and state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12756)|
| 3:32:39| So it concerns me when we talk about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12759)|
| 3:32:43| that we may not be following the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| Quite honest, with charter school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12765)|
| 3:32:46| that Title IX issue concerned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| But, you know, we passed it, and I said we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12769)|
| 3:32:54| I didn't say you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12774)|
| 3:32:55| I said we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12775)|
| 3:32:56| I was part of the board when it passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12776)|
| 3:32:58| and so I'm part of the board any other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12778)|
| 3:33:00| And I'm part of the board now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| I'm saying I have that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| But hearing that and hearing the professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| who are looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12788)|
| 3:33:09| and I'm saying that is one way we can have assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| that it has been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| Now I do understand what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12795)|
| 3:33:18| about the national organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12798)|
| 3:33:20| We could debate that all night long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12800)|
| 3:33:23| and not necessarily agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12803)|
| 3:33:24| But one thing I think we may be able to agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| is that what we just heard could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| I didn't say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12810)|
| 3:33:31| but could be a way for us to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12811)|
| 3:33:34| that we have been assured with not having a process in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| we have a process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12818)|
| 3:33:40| So that is my understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12820)|
| 3:33:45| So I think we're voting on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| we're going to put kids on the bus, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12828)|
| 3:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| So with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| I think that this is needed to help us expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12835)|
| 3:33:59| help the Freedom School expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| and help the students in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12841)|
| 3:34:05| And one of the reasons why I'm saying us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| is because a couple of District 1 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12847)|
| 3:34:11| Region 5 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| we're talking about all this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| we're going to do for Region 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| and this is one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12857)|
| 3:34:18| that really will be a shot in the arm for Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12858)|
| 3:34:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12862)|
| 3:34:27| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12867)|
| 3:34:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12868)|
| 3:34:30| In the two days that we've discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| or two meetings that we've discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| I have heard a lot of folks on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| and I respect your concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12876)|
| 3:34:39| related to the Children's Defense Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| and things that you found on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12881)|
| 3:34:44| I do think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12884)|
| 3:34:46| that what they have on their website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12886)|
| 3:34:48| is really not up for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12888)|
| 3:34:50| even when it comes to state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12890)|
| 3:34:52| and that what we're really talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12892)|
| 3:34:54| is the curriculum that's used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12894)|
| 3:34:56| within the East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| And there's lots of national organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| that have lots of different thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12902)|
| 3:35:04| about lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12904)|
| 3:35:06| But that's not what we're debating tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| We're debating whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| and I think some of us are debating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| whether or not we feel like in our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12912)|
| 3:35:14| that the very particular curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| that's being used by Ms. Dean and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12917)|
| 3:35:20| at Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12920)|
| 3:35:21| whether or not it breaks the Tennessee law or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| We've heard from at least one professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| that feels like in her opinion as a doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| and somebody at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12930)|
| 3:35:32| who's written the curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12932)|
| 3:35:33| and also been training teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12933)|
| 3:35:34| on how to interpret the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| relates to their practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| doesn't feel like it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| So again, I would urge those who are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12941)|
| 3:35:45| about the full body of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12945)|
| 3:35:50| that the CDF has put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| to not confuse that full body of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12952)|
| 3:35:55| with what's being taught to kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| within Freedom Schools in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12957)|
| 3:36:02| I can't speak to that full body of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12962)|
| 3:36:04| nor do I intend to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| because that's not my purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12966)|
| 3:36:08| as a Knox County School Board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12968)|
| 3:36:11| What I'm being asked tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| is to consider whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12973)|
| 3:36:14| a program that's asking for some additional resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| and actually didn't even directly ask for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12977)|
| 3:36:20| but it came up in a dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12980)|
| 3:36:22| in a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12982)|
| 3:36:23| out of wanting to mutually benefit children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12983)|
| 3:36:26| I would ask us to limit our decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12986)|
| 3:36:30| on what we believe about Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12990)|
| 3:36:33| And we heard person after person after person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12993)|
| 3:36:36| who's been directly involved in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| who have written curriculum from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=12998)|
| 3:36:40| whose kids who have experienced it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13000)|
| 3:36:42| who have served in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13002)|
| 3:36:43| only speak good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13003)|
| 3:36:47| And yes, we did have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| there was a lot of people to count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13009)|
| 3:36:50| but I think we only had two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| actually speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13012)|
| 3:36:53| One I thought was going to actually didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13013)|
| 3:36:56| which I'm going to give that man some love later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| That was surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13019)|
| 3:37:02| I loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| But that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13024)|
| 3:37:05| I mean, that's so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| And for me, for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13027)|
| 3:37:08| it's not just about this one decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| It's just like, man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| here's somebody who I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| would have been challenged with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13032)|
| 3:37:14| saying, hey, I want to listen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13034)|
| 3:37:16| I mean, to me, that's like what we need more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| And so that's what was so good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| It wasn't because of this one particular decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13041)|
| 3:37:25| Anyway, the community knew this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| This was talked about a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| Yes, we did have some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| who came and expressed legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| They were by far in the minority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| So again, I would encourage us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13057)|
| 3:37:38| not to get confused about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13058)|
| 3:37:42| making an indictment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13062)|
| 3:37:43| against a national organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13063)|
| 3:37:44| about their full body of thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| that they put out in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| but that we would honor an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| that's honored our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13071)|
| 3:37:52| for at least the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| I'm going to interject here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13076)|
| 3:37:57| because my transportation concern was two-part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13077)|
| 3:38:01| So I'm going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| this is mostly me speaking to Reverend Butler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| here right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13085)|
| 3:38:06| but so the other part was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13086)|
| 3:38:09| other organizations provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13089)|
| 3:38:12| and first, let me start by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13092)|
| 3:38:14| I have no problem with 100 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| riding in 100 bus seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13096)|
| 3:38:18| to a school that the bus is already traveling to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13098)|
| 3:38:21| I have no issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| And, you know, if there's space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| for other organizations to do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| on buses that are stopping in those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| and going to those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13112)|
| 3:38:33| I mean, I would say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13113)|
| 3:38:37| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| it seems that there is a transportation piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13119)|
| 3:38:43| that, where we are not already running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13123)|
| 3:38:46| those buses in those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| And as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13129)|
| 3:38:52| that raises the question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13132)|
| 3:38:56| you know, you want to be fair to everybody, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13136)|
| 3:38:58| So if another organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13138)|
| 3:39:00| needs transportation for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| we want to be fair, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| So my question to Reverend Butler is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13145)|
| 3:39:08| and I've talked to Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13148)|
| 3:39:10| about this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13150)|
| 3:39:11| I think you said Freedom Schools start a week later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13151)|
| 3:39:15| or a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| there was a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13157)|
| 3:39:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13158)|
| 3:39:19| Yes, ma'am, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| They start a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13160)|
| 3:39:21| So we're talking those buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13161)|
| 3:39:24| that would already be stopping in those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| with the empty seats and going to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| that would be three weeks of the six-week program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13171)|
| 3:39:32| They would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| when the SLC's program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| when that is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13177)|
| 3:39:39| there will be three additional weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| that Freedom Schools will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13181)|
| 3:39:44| So we are talking about the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13184)|
| 3:39:47| for the three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13187)|
| 3:39:48| that we have kids already in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13188)|
| 3:39:52| Or are we talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13192)|
| 3:39:55| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13195)|
| 3:39:56| are y'all following where I'm going with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| I just, okay, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| I just wanted to throw that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| to kind of digest if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13203)|
| 3:40:08| You want me to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13208)|
| 3:40:10| Well, you can think about it for a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| and I will go to Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13211)|
| 3:40:12| I just wanted you to digest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13212)|
| 3:40:14| because that's kind of where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13214)|
| 3:40:15| I'm thinking about these other organizations and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13215)|
| 3:40:19| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13219)|
| 3:40:20| unless she's going to speak on the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13220)|
| 3:40:22| I would prefer to go ahead and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13222)|
| 3:40:24| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13224)|
| 3:40:25| Because I may not remember what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| I'm sure Ms. Horn won't mind if you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13229)|
| 3:40:30| I'm just honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13230)|
| 3:40:31| Absolutely, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13231)|
| 3:40:32| It's after nine o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13232)|
| 3:40:34| so I'm at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13234)|
| 3:40:36| So what my response is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13236)|
| 3:40:39| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| if we were to pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13242)|
| 3:40:45| I think that the Freedom School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| would take what they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| So if it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| and when we first talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| I'll be honest and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13252)|
| 3:40:53| I thought we was talking about the same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13253)|
| 3:40:58| And the comment I made was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13258)|
| 3:41:00| is that we're talking about putting kids on buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13260)|
| 3:41:03| that are already running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| So if that was an accurate statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13265)|
| 3:41:08| that would be three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13268)|
| 3:41:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13269)|
| 3:41:10| So that's the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13270)|
| 3:41:11| That's what I meant then and that's what I mean now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13271)|
| 3:41:14| If we run the buses when the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13274)|
| 3:41:16| are not going to the school for the Knox County purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13276)|
| 3:41:20| Knox County Schools purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| then it wouldn't be buses already running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13282)|
| 3:41:25| So I made the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13285)|
| 3:41:26| I stand by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| I'm not sure how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13287)|
| 3:41:28| what the mechanics work out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13288)|
| 3:41:31| but that's the statement I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| That's the statement I stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13293)|
| 3:41:34| Okay, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| I wanted to be clear on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13295)|
| 3:41:36| because there were some kind of questions in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13296)|
| 3:41:38| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13298)|
| 3:41:39| when we started talking to Dr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| if there were six weeks or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| And I just wanted to be clear on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13304)|
| 3:41:46| because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| I don't have problems with kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| riding on empty bus seats for any organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| What my concern, twofold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13312)|
| 3:41:54| was number one is when we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| whether or not us letting them ride on the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| would be promoting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13320)|
| 3:42:01| I didn't think it would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13321)|
| 3:42:02| because they're just riding on the bus already going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13322)|
| 3:42:04| You're not spending any extra money on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13324)|
| 3:42:07| The second thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13327)|
| 3:42:08| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13328)|
| 3:42:09| I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13329)|
| 3:42:10| the second thing was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13330)|
| 3:42:11| though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13331)|
| 3:42:12| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| if it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13334)|
| 3:42:16| if they're not going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13336)|
| 3:42:17| if they're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| if it is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| then we have something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| to make sure that we are following the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13343)|
| 3:42:24| I'm just thinking that whole funding piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13344)|
| 3:42:27| could probably be argued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13347)|
| 3:42:28| if the buses were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| we were already paying that for the buses anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13352)|
| 3:42:33| if somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| I don't know if it's getting late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13354)|
| 3:42:35| if that even makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13355)|
| 3:42:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13356)|
| 3:42:37| Ms. Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13357)|
| 3:42:38| I'm going to go to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13358)|
| 3:42:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13363)|
| 3:42:44| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13364)|
| 3:42:45| obviously everybody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| I am very much for parental rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| and parents making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13369)|
| 3:42:50| So that's why I voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13372)|
| 3:42:53| one reason why I voted for the data sharing agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| because parents give their approval for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| and they're choosing to send their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| to freedom school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13379)|
| 3:43:00| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13380)|
| 3:43:01| and also since it's consistent with practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13384)|
| 3:43:05| I feel very comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| I share the concerns that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| that Ms. Henderson and Mr. Triplett have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13389)|
| 3:43:12| about the national organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13392)|
| 3:43:14| and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13394)|
| 3:43:15| and Ms. Steen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13395)|
| 3:43:16| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13396)|
| 3:43:17| testified on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13397)|
| 3:43:19| They spoke with us on Monday about the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13401)|
| 3:43:22| that they definitely are a part of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13402)|
| 3:43:24| And so that's a concern for me to have an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13404)|
| 3:43:30| Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| very impressive testimonies this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13414)|
| 3:43:35| And I have no doubt that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13415)|
| 3:43:38| that kids love to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13418)|
| 3:43:39| and that parents are passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13419)|
| 3:43:42| And so parents have every right to utilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13422)|
| 3:43:47| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13427)|
| 3:43:48| as we also talked about the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13428)|
| 3:43:49| I think it's very different when you look at this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13429)|
| 3:43:53| asking for facility use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13433)|
| 3:43:55| which is what's been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| versus what we're looking at here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13437)|
| 3:44:00| which would commit resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| Because even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| even if it's not going to commit additional dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13443)|
| 3:44:06| it does commit additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13446)|
| 3:44:08| And I also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13448)|
| 3:44:10| Ms. Christy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13450)|
| 3:44:11| have the concern about other organizations that meet in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13451)|
| 3:44:14| that when they see or hear that this organization has bus privileges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13454)|
| 3:44:22| but other ones don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13462)|
| 3:44:24| because a lot of our schools have Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13464)|
| 3:44:28| KidTime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13468)|
| 3:44:29| YMCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13469)|
| 3:44:30| all these different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13470)|
| 3:44:31| And so I'm not sure that we've fully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13471)|
| 3:44:35| fully recognized the gravity of the ripple effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13475)|
| 3:44:39| and unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| And I also think that there's been a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13484)|
| 3:44:45| And so anytime you have this many questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| that's a concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13488)|
| 3:44:49| And I'm not sure that we've thought through all of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| all of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13492)|
| 3:44:53| So for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13493)|
| 3:44:54| for those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13494)|
| 3:44:55| I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13495)|
| 3:44:59| Ms. Sowen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13499)|
| 3:45:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| So is the motion looking at providing the buses for the full time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13505)|
| 3:45:14| or only for the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13514)|
| 3:45:16| only for those three weeks when the time overlaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13516)|
| 3:45:22| Thank you, Ms. Sowen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13522)|
| 3:45:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13523)|
| 3:45:24| There's nothing explicit in the MOU as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13524)|
| 3:45:27| that actually speaks to the duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13527)|
| 3:45:31| What I was asking for was approval of the MOU minus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13531)|
| 3:45:36| in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13536)|
| 3:45:37| a few bullet points related to the data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13537)|
| 3:45:41| I would think if the MOU were to get worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| what in the way the spirit of the MOU is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13544)|
| 3:45:47| if the resources are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13547)|
| 3:45:50| To me, if buses aren't running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13550)|
| 3:45:51| then the resources aren't available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13551)|
| 3:45:54| And so Ms. Dean and the organization for years have figured out other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13554)|
| 3:46:00| transportation opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13560)|
| 3:46:02| And to Reverend Butler's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| I can't speak for Ms. Dean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| but I would assume she would take what she can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| And if that's three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13569)|
| 3:46:10| she doesn't have to find transportation versus the other three weeks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13570)|
| 3:46:15| she might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13575)|
| 3:46:16| My assumption is with her in this robust community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13576)|
| 3:46:18| they'll figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13578)|
| 3:46:19| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| the MOU is not explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| It does not commit the district to any period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13583)|
| 3:46:26| whether it's six weeks, four weeks, three weeks, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| It seems like the spirit of the MOU is if and when the resources are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13588)|
| 3:46:31| provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13591)|
| 3:46:32| even down to the specific seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| If the seat isn't available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13594)|
| 3:46:36| then they would not be able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13596)|
| 3:46:39| So it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13599)|
| 3:46:40| it's nuanced in terms of resource availability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13600)|
| 3:46:43| but it doesn't speak to duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13603)|
| 3:46:46| Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13606)|
| 3:46:47| is that the way you hear it also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13607)|
| 3:46:52| Page two of the proposed MOU states that transportation is available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13612)|
| 3:46:59| the Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| If they are operating at sites where KCS is running a summer learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13621)|
| 3:47:05| camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13625)|
| 3:47:06| it goes on to say if already running buses and running at the same times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13626)|
| 3:47:09| within the school zone and have open capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13629)|
| 3:47:12| So it would be limited to open seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| It also says if funding to provide transportation is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13634)|
| 3:47:18| So if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13638)|
| 3:47:19| so if transportation is not available at that particular school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| it would not be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13642)|
| 3:47:23| So that's already in the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| So I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13645)|
| 3:47:26| so I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13646)|
| 3:47:27| my reading of the MOU agrees with what Reverend Butler's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13647)|
| 3:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13651)|
| 3:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13652)|
| 3:47:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13653)|
| 3:47:36| Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13656)|
| 3:47:37| Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13657)|
| 3:47:38| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13658)|
| 3:47:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| I know it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| So speaking in terms of some of these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13661)|
| 3:47:45| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13665)|
| 3:47:46| I would love to get to a place where we could work some of this out or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13666)|
| 3:47:51| work out a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13671)|
| 3:47:52| Is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13672)|
| 3:47:53| do you see this being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13675)|
| 3:47:56| I know we have a lot of organizations in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13680)|
| 3:48:01| And I guess it's really hard to predict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13683)|
| 3:48:04| how many are going to see the outcome of this and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13684)|
| 3:48:07| hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13687)|
| 3:48:08| I want to ride on those buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13688)|
| 3:48:13| And then if there's a bus going to school and there's two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13693)|
| 3:48:16| organizations having a summer program in that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13696)|
| 3:48:19| suddenly it might be that there's room on the bus for some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13699)|
| 3:48:23| programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13703)|
| 3:48:24| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13704)|
| 3:48:25| and I know that this is all hypothetical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| but I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13707)|
| 3:48:28| I can see us getting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13708)|
| 3:48:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13710)|
| 3:48:31| Can you speak a little to that or if you would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13711)|
| 3:48:34| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13714)|
| 3:48:35| concerns about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13715)|
| 3:48:36| Because I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13716)|
| 3:48:37| It's not that I have issues with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| It's not that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13722)|
| 3:48:43| I'm just trying to think ahead because I don't want to be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13723)|
| 3:48:47| where we have two or three organizations at the same school needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13727)|
| 3:48:51| transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13731)|
| 3:48:52| And suddenly there's seats for half the kids and not the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13732)|
| 3:48:57| And then what do you do not give transportation to any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13737)|
| 3:49:00| or are we in a position where we have to add another bus and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13740)|
| 3:49:05| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13745)|
| 3:49:06| transportation is a really big expense as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13746)|
| 3:49:09| I don't know if you can shed some light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13749)|
| 3:49:14| You probably can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13754)|
| 3:49:15| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13755)|
| 3:49:16| Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13756)|
| 3:49:17| members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13757)|
| 3:49:18| It is not problematic for the simple fact that this is a unique situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13758)|
| 3:49:22| where we have SLCs going to a school site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| It's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| we have a policy where we have to pick up a student at a certain address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13766)|
| 3:49:32| and take them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13772)|
| 3:49:33| I'll just say Chuck E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| Cheese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13775)|
| 3:49:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13776)|
| 3:49:37| So we are staying within the realm of what the policy states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| And so it's certainly not problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| And I'll take it a step further to say if they were able to adjust their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13784)|
| 3:49:47| schedule to a four week timeframe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13787)|
| 3:49:50| we could align much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13790)|
| 3:49:53| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| and I do want to apologize to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13794)|
| 3:49:56| Bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13796)|
| 3:49:57| the question that you're asking me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13797)|
| 3:49:58| I was referring to the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| the overall program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| as far as the SLC mixed in with freedom school transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13802)|
| 3:50:06| So there is no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13806)|
| 3:50:08| Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13808)|
| 3:50:09| we're already running buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13809)|
| 3:50:10| but when you get outside of that window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13810)|
| 3:50:12| we could get an exact amount if they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13812)|
| 3:50:14| if they chose to work with a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13814)|
| 3:50:19| So what I'm hearing you say is that it would not be problematic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13819)|
| 3:50:23| transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13823)|
| 3:50:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13824)|
| 3:50:25| And we are currently working with girls and boys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| boys club and having conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| Now we could be better partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13832)|
| 3:50:33| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13833)|
| 3:50:34| once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13834)|
| 3:50:35| that sets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13835)|
| 3:50:36| those are routes that are currently happening and we're having those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13836)|
| 3:50:38| discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13838)|
| 3:50:39| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13839)|
| 3:50:40| no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13840)|
| 3:50:41| we will not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13841)|
| 3:50:42| in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13842)|
| 3:50:43| and I've had several conversations with Ryan about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| He's not concerned about it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13845)|
| 3:50:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13846)|
| 3:50:47| And I assume if it were to become problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| you would bring it back to the board and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13850)|
| 3:50:53| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13853)|
| 3:50:54| ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13854)|
| 3:50:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13855)|
| 3:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13856)|
| 3:50:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13857)|
| 3:50:58| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13858)|
| 3:50:59| so we have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13859)|

| 3:51:02| Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13862)|
| 3:51:03| I believe it was to approve the transportation piece for the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13863)|
| 3:51:08| When they're already running to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13868)|
| 3:51:10| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=13870)|

| 3:59:20| and a policy to allow it and other outside therapy providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14360)|
| 3:59:24| The discussion was encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14364)|

| 3:59:48| to maintain forward progress with this new comprehensive policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14388)|
| 3:59:51| for outside service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| and ensure it specifically allows for students with autism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14393)|
| 3:59:56| to have their applied behavior analyst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14396)|

| 4:00:08| and I look forward to reviewing this new comprehensive policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14408)|

| 4:00:15| There are three key areas I want to make sure are addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14415)|
| 4:00:19| in this comprehensive policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| First, it's critical that any policy redirects the current mindset at KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14421)|
| 4:00:25| which treats ABA therapy as if it were elective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14425)|
| 4:00:28| and provides a clear process for autism spectrum disorder students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14428)|
| 4:00:32| to receive medically necessary treatment at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14432)|
| 4:00:35| Second, currently KCS central office staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14435)|
| 4:00:38| can supersede orders from a medical doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14438)|
| 4:00:41| and license board certified medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14441)|
| 4:00:44| when recommending interventions in an IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14444)|
| 4:00:47| In short, the question of whom deems what to be medically necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14447)|
| 4:00:51| is an item of high importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14451)|
| 4:00:54| Third, I want to make it perfectly clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| we want our insurance provided ABA therapists in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14456)|
| 4:01:00| We are not asking KCS to incur the costs of providing ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14460)|
| 4:01:04| I believe addressing these items will ensure no other parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14464)|
| 4:01:07| has to experience what my husband and I went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14467)|
| 4:01:10| as we waited five months for an answer to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14470)|
| 4:01:13| can my son's therapist join him in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14473)|
| 4:01:16| The answer to that question was eventually no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14476)|
| 4:01:19| So I voiced my concern at a February IEP meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14479)|
| 4:01:22| that the only therapy approved to treat autism spectrum disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14482)|
| 4:01:25| was not being recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| We then decided to remove my son from school every Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14487)|
| 4:01:30| so he could attend therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| He's approved for 30 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14492)|
| 4:01:35| This is a medically excused absence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| but unfortunately now this increases his school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| chronic absenteeism rate, and it doesn't have to be this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14500)|
| 4:01:44| Finally, I want to express my appreciation for being selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14504)|
| 4:01:47| for the special education task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| and hope that my contributions will affect positive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14512)|
| 4:01:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14514)|
| 4:01:56| Jennifer Galloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14516)|
| 4:01:59| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14519)|
| 4:02:07| Hi, I'm Jennifer Galloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| I've been a teacher and a coach at Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14531)|
| 4:02:14| from the first day we opened in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14534)|
| 4:02:17| I've watched my three kids grow up in the HVA gym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14537)|
| 4:02:20| and I have matured as a teacher and a coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14540)|
| 4:02:23| through the leadership of both Hardin Valley Academy's administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14543)|
| 4:02:27| Our school has always been led by a person who challenges the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14547)|
| 4:02:30| and who has the kids' best interest at the front of every decision made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14550)|
| 4:02:34| all while making sure we are aligned with the district's vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14554)|
| 4:02:37| HVA, like our district, is striving to help our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14557)|
| 4:02:40| become 865 Ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14560)|
| 4:02:43| 865 Ready is a new initiative in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14563)|
| 4:02:46| but many don't know that Dr. Spies has already started that movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14566)|
| 4:02:49| in his first four years as principal at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14569)|
| 4:02:52| We are headed in the right direction to prepare our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14572)|
| 4:02:55| to be 865 Ready and for them to make an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14575)|
| 4:02:58| in the Knoxville community and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14578)|
| 4:03:01| This is largely because of Rob Spies, and despite some of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14581)|
| 4:03:04| challenging years with COVID and its aftermath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14584)|
| 4:03:07| we are moving forward, and we are moving forward fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14587)|
| 4:03:10| We have changed our building layout and our schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14590)|
| 4:03:13| so that our kids have the space and time to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14593)|
| 4:03:16| all that the 865 Academy's program has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14596)|
| 4:03:19| Rob is the leader of this movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14599)|
| 4:03:22| He is the driving force behind the innovative things we are doing at HVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14602)|
| 4:03:25| but our momentum has been halted over the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14605)|
| 4:03:28| We are in a holding pattern as we wait for answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14608)|
| 4:03:31| while our leader is being investigated and we watch his name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| getting dragged through the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14614)|
| 4:03:37| HVA and Rob Spies have been misrepresented in the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14617)|
| 4:03:40| and on social media, so now we wait for answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14620)|
| 4:03:43| hoping that we get our leader back and not just another setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14623)|
| 4:03:46| What do I mean by setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14626)|
| 4:03:49| Some teachers at HVA are under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14629)|
| 4:03:52| that even if Dr. Spies is exonerated by the investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14632)|
| 4:03:55| he still may not be back at HVA next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14635)|
| 4:03:58| I can't imagine why this would even be considered with as much support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14638)|
| 4:04:01| as he has from our staff and community, but it's still a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14641)|
| 4:04:04| No one seems to be willing to say that if Dr. Spies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14644)|
| 4:04:07| did nothing wrong, then of course he would be reinstated at HVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14647)|
| 4:04:10| But if you don't do this, then I believe our 865 Ready efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14650)|
| 4:04:13| will be set so far behind where they are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14653)|
| 4:04:16| it might take us years to recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14656)|
| 4:04:19| Not only that, but you will have a group of disappointed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| Don't misunderstand what I'm saying today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14662)|
| 4:04:25| The teachers at Hardin Valley are still getting the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14665)|
| 4:04:28| We're doing what's best for kids while we continue to hear vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14668)|
| 4:04:31| or false information about our school and our leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14671)|
| 4:04:34| Regardless, we have kept our kids alive and we have continued to teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14674)|
| 4:04:37| and prepare them to be lifelong learners throughout this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| This includes the day of the gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14680)|
| 4:04:43| Hardin Valley Academy is such an awesome place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14683)|
| 4:04:46| We are doing great things and we'll find a way to be better than ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14686)|
| 4:04:49| in all we do academically, athletically, and artistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14689)|
| 4:04:52| And Rob Spies, he will land on his feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14692)|
| 4:04:55| wherever that may be, but Rob is a Hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| His own kids are Hawks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14698)|
| 4:05:01| His place in this community is our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14701)|
| 4:05:04| So when this investigation shows he did the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14704)|
| 4:05:07| please make sure the place he lands is back at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14707)|
| 4:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14710)|
| 4:05:13| Keith Galloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14713)|
| 4:05:26| I'm Keith Galloway, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14726)|
| 4:05:29| I'm also a resident of Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14729)|
| 4:05:32| Actually, I do a lot more than just live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14732)|
| 4:05:35| I'm heavily involved in several aspects of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14735)|
| 4:05:38| I'm a member of the Hardin Valley Youth Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14738)|
| 4:05:41| I'm a member of the Hardin Valley Community Business Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14741)|
| 4:05:44| And I sit on the board of the Hardin Valley Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14744)|
| 4:05:47| I've been here in Hardin Valley since the academy first opened in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14747)|
| 4:05:50| working here for 10 years as a math teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14750)|
| 4:05:53| and 8 years as the head boys' basketball coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14753)|
| 4:05:56| My wife, Jennifer, who just spoke, has been there even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14756)|
| 4:05:59| She has been a teacher and the head girls' basketball coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14759)|
| 4:06:02| since the school opened, and now she is serving as the freshman academy dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14762)|
| 4:06:06| All three of our children are in Hardin Valley schools as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| which is one of the reasons we commit so much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| to the success of the school and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14772)|
| 4:06:15| I challenge you to find anyone who knows us and our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14775)|
| 4:06:18| who doesn't say we are high-character staples in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14778)|
| 4:06:22| We are dedicated to making it the best it can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14782)|
| 4:06:25| not just for our own family's sake, but for every family's sake in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14785)|
| 4:06:30| I don't say this to be boastful. Don't misunderstand what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| I'm conveying that our voice has merit and should be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14793)|
| 4:06:37| And in that regard, we are incredibly disheartened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14797)|
| 4:06:40| by the way this whole situation is playing out with the gas leak incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14800)|
| 4:06:43| on March 30th and the subsequent investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14803)|
| 4:06:48| The day this all went down, it seemed like the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14808)|
| 4:06:51| where an unstable individual unsuccessfully attempted an act of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14811)|
| 4:06:56| And it turned into a situation where an absolutely false narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14816)|
| 4:06:59| spread like wildfire on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14819)|
| 4:07:02| causing people to believe something happened that in fact did not happen at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14822)|
| 4:07:06| But I won't go down that road. I won't sell you my conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14826)|
| 4:07:09| on what happened that day because I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14829)|
| 4:07:12| But I also caution you not to listen to the outraged keyboard warriors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14832)|
| 4:07:16| on social media who took limited information, likely from their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14836)|
| 4:07:20| or from somebody else on social media, and made false assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14840)|
| 4:07:24| that eventually led to an untrue story being told of what actually happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14844)|
| 4:07:28| Please don't listen to them about that story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14848)|
| 4:07:31| and don't listen to them when it comes to how our community feels about Rob Spies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14851)|
| 4:07:35| They are the loud minority, and they do not represent what our community thinks about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14855)|
| 4:07:39| Which brings me to how I feel about Rob Spies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14859)|
| 4:07:42| I've gotten to know him in multiple capacities these last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14862)|
| 4:07:45| and there is no one I would rather have more as a principal at HVA than Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14865)|
| 4:07:50| He treats HVA as though he's been there since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14870)|
| 4:07:53| He took the challenge seriously of continuing what Salih Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14873)|
| 4:07:56| had successfully started, but in his own unique way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14876)|
| 4:08:00| He is engaged and invested in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14880)|
| 4:08:03| and he believes in the potential of HVA just like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14883)|
| 4:08:06| He is a true hawk, and when this investigation exonerates him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14886)|
| 4:08:09| it would be an absolute travesty if he did not end up back at HVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14889)|
| 4:08:13| Our community wants him there, and the vast majority of the parents and students want him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14893)|
| 4:08:17| And last but not least, the teachers and staff want him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14897)|
| 4:08:20| How do I know this? Because I'm engaged in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14900)|
| 4:08:23| I know what it takes to be a good member and good leader in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14903)|
| 4:08:26| and I can't imagine a leader more fit for this job as principal at HVA than Rob Spies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14906)|
| 4:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14910)|
| 4:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| Jennifer Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14913)|
| 4:08:42| Hi, Jennifer Rose, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14922)|
| 4:08:45| I want to start with thanking you guys for, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14925)|
| 4:08:48| having the discussion on Monday during the work session in regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14928)|
| 4:08:51| having our children's ABA therapist in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14931)|
| 4:08:54| As I stand here today for my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14934)|
| 4:08:57| but also for the group of other children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14937)|
| 4:09:00| who have sought ABA therapy in schools and have been turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14940)|
| 4:09:04| The excuses we receive are many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14944)|
| 4:09:07| but they involve arbitrary barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14947)|
| 4:09:10| We have been told, one, Knox County schools will not recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14950)|
| 4:09:13| ABA therapy in the school, just like it does not recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14953)|
| 4:09:16| piano lessons in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14956)|
| 4:09:19| Two, that ABA therapy is simply not allowed in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| and that three, ABA practices but not ABA therapy is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14963)|
| 4:09:28| Accordingly, this is our formal request to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14968)|
| 4:09:31| for clear policy guidance to all Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14971)|
| 4:09:34| that ABA therapy in the schools must be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14974)|
| 4:09:38| ABA therapy is a necessary medical treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14978)|
| 4:09:41| for children with autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| a reasonable accommodation under the ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14984)|
| 4:09:47| much like medicine or insulin and many other accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14987)|
| 4:09:51| it will provide children with autism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14991)|
| 4:09:54| meaningful and equal opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14994)|
| 4:09:57| Here in Knox County, excluding ABA therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=14997)|
| 4:10:00| has become a chief means of excluding the child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15000)|
| 4:10:03| from school altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15003)|
| 4:10:06| We must constantly depart the school in order to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15006)|
| 4:10:09| the ABA therapy our children need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15009)|
| 4:10:12| In closing, the current general non-discrimination policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15012)|
| 4:10:15| obviously are not working when it comes to ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15015)|
| 4:10:20| Accordingly, we are asking for clear guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15020)|
| 4:10:23| to the schools, removing all impediments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15023)|
| 4:10:26| so that our request may be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15026)|
| 4:10:29| And as we go through and I look forward to the policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15029)|
| 4:10:32| on May 19th, I hope that you guys really take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| that who gets to deem it medically necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15035)|
| 4:10:39| That is a huge factor in our children getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15039)|
| 4:10:42| what they need at school to have that quality education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| that every child gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15045)|
| 4:10:48| I really appreciate your all's time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15048)|
| 4:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15051)|
| 4:11:06| I'm Erin Kay at Knox County and really what I have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| is directed to the ladies behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| I want to say to you guys, I appreciate that you took the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15072)|
| 4:11:15| out month after month and sitting through these marathon board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15075)|
| 4:11:18| and that you guys have listened to their concerns and that you're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15078)|
| 4:11:21| a policy in place or considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15081)|
| 4:11:24| I echo Ms. Rose and Ms. Piper that I hope that you do follow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15084)|
| 4:11:27| with what you've told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15087)|
| 4:11:30| And to those mothers, I know that the people at home won't be able to hear me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15090)|
| 4:11:33| if I don't speak in the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15093)|
| 4:11:36| I really want to look at them and tell them how proud I am of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15096)|
| 4:11:39| and how impressed I am with them coming together to advocate for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15099)|
| 4:11:42| While I wish that you guys would listen to all of the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15102)|
| 4:11:45| the way you've listened to these moms, I have to give you credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=15105)|
