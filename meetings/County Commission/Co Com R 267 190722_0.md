| 0:03:08| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Tonight's devotional will be led by Commissioner John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Tonight I have a leader's prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| We have so many leaders from our county administration and our county departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| and our leaders that watch us on community TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| I thought this would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| So, will you join me in prayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Leadership is hard to define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Lord, let us be the ones to define it with justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Leadership is like a handful of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| Lord, let us be the people to share it with those who thirst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Leadership is not about watching and correcting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| Lord, let us remember it is about listening and connecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Leadership is not about telling people what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Lord, let us find out what people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Leadership is less about the love of power and more about the power of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| Lord, as we continue to undertake the role of leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| let us be affirmed by the servant leadership we witness in your son, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Let us walk in the path he has set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Let our greatest passion be compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Our greatest victory, the reward of peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| In leading, let us never fail to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=272)|

| 0:15:25| but more so as a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| And this family is just mourning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| So please keep them in your thoughts and prayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| and honor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=937)|
| 0:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=947)|
| 0:16:17| Andrea, you want to go and get a quick picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| with all the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| I'd ask the commissioners to step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| She's been our right hand for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=983)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1009)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1037)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1068)|
| 0:18:12| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Moving on, we have the next item on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| I've got about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| about 11 folks who have asked to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| The first person who signed up was Ms. Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Is Petra here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I know she had signed up early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| but I think she had signed up to speak about a zoning matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| that's coming up in the second meeting at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Petra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| So, Ms. Rule, if you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I'll hold calling on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| until we get into the zoning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| which starts at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| All right. Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| David, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| I know we spoke earlier, I think, when you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| David Haynes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I'm sorry my mic keeps going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| We've got about 9 or 10 folks who have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| to speak about the budget for the police department or 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I'd like to have the first 15 minutes of public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| just split up between some of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| who want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| We usually give everybody five minutes to talk on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| And when I spoke with one of the folks earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| he had said that, you know, some may speak for five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| some may speak for two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| and we weren't really exactly sure how that was going to land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| And anybody who we don't get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| we have actually on voting Mondays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| we have two public forums on each Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| So anybody that I don't get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| will be able to speak at the other public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| later this evening or during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Democracy is about hearing all voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| If people sign up to speak tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| they should be able to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Oh, everybody is going to speak tonight, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Yeah, I'm just saying, if you look at the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| we've got two public forums on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| I'm just trying to split it evenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| between the two public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Go ahead, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| You've got five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| and just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| So my name is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| My address is 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| At the beginning of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I heard you mention justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| at the beginning of the prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| It's actually out of place and inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| for someone from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| to talk about anything having to do with justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| So Knox County is continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| to perpetuate injustice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| through all the various means, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| So instead of looking after all of your residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| instead of making sure the safety and well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| of all residents of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| are being taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| you not only target folks using the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| you oppress them and you kick them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| using the 287G program, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And we have the biggest part of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| being increased and increased upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| and more and more investment and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| going to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| when the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| is unapologetically targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| and kicking out our beloved residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and neighbors in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| And let's talk about the sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| People talk all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| about the Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| not Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| has been in the news a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| with a lot of the controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| and scandals going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| with a lot of sexist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| and inappropriate behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| and even some cases of brutality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| But everybody in Knoxville knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| KP doesn't have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| on Knox County sheriffs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Those are the dangerous ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Those are the ones you watch out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Those are the folks who people fear, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| They are known for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| one of the most brutal institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| in this whole region, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| And there's no community oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| They are able to just do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| whatever they want to people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| with no oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| at least in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| There's a little bit of something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| It doesn't have any teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| but there's at least some avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| for the community to have his voice heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| That doesn't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| That's a shame, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| So even though there's no oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| and no accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| and we see the brutality going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| year after year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| by the hands of the sheriffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| outside and inside the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| we see their budget continue to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| while decreasing social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| and healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| You can brag about a new police car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| while also cutting millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| from social services and healthcare, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| So we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| who can't afford healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| They call it the indigent folks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| I don't like that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| These are just rugged people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| who don't have the same needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| as everybody else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| So to target those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| and say, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| we're not going to provide healthcare for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| We're not going to help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| At the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| increasing the police budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| what you are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| is perpetuating cycles of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| in our community, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| And what 287G does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| it puts a focal point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| and a target on a brown community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| on an immigrant community, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| It's messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| So 287G is immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Rounding up people to deport them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| and in Knox County jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| is immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1377)|

| 0:23:03| Causing fear among people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| is immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Causing people to give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| their Monday nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1387)|

| 0:23:09| Everybody sees what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| at the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| We have a crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| a human rights crisis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| We have people in concentration camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| You may not want to call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| concentration camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| but they're nowhere near anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| you want to send your kids to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| You would never let anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1401)|

| 0:23:25| those folks at the border are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| But yet, y'all are spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| and putting resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| to shipping residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| who you should be taking care of, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| They're shipping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| out of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| for them only to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| and lots of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| they end up in those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| at the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| That's immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| It's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| So my name is David Hayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| and I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I'm with a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| called the City Council Movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| and we're planning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| take over the City Council, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| And I want to let y'all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| that y'all days are numbered, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1429)|

| 0:23:52| The county's just around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| And until y'all get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| y'alls act together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| which I severely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I don't believe y'all ever will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| I believe you will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| It's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1441)|

| 0:24:08| Thank you, Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| The next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| who is asked to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| is Rupert Leckron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And if I pronounce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Rupert, if I pronounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| your last name incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| please accept my apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| It's totally all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| It's a weird last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| So my name is Rupert Leckron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| I'm from 1709 North Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1470)|

| 0:24:36| which was recently renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| 287G, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| delegates immigration authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| from federal agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| to local law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| lets the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| interview detainees in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| regarding their immigration status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| make determinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| about their deportability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| and access federal databases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| and computer systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| according to experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| And that's a quote from WBIR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Knoxville's partnership with ICE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| makes it complicit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| and facilitating of racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| I quote the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Last fall, the county signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| an intergovernmental service agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| also known as an IGSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| which pays the county $67| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| per ICE detainee per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| ICE detainees spiked numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| following the new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Tell me that that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| detestable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| The city is profiting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| the exploitation, abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| and endangerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| of innocent people and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| People, human beings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| should not have to fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| They should not have to fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| going to or taking their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| to the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| They should not have to fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| walking down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| knowing that they or their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| could be detained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| and put into ICE custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| where innocent people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| parents, siblings, and children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| are being denied basic rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| trapped in filth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| and dying, quite literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I stress the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| that these are innocent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| The county put out a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| that said that immigrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| will not be profiled and approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| unless they are, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| out doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| you're not supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| I quote Sheriff Spangler himself on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| That's not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Not only is racial profiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| incentivized by the aforementioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| $67 payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| it has been made known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| that almost all immigrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| detained since this bill passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| were approached for non-violent misdemeanors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| such as, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| talking on the phone while driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| which I feel confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I can say that everyone here has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| But everything aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| the fact that basic human rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| are even a point of debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| is sickening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| How far from grace have we fallen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| that it's controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| whether or not families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| should be torn apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| and detained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| in life-threatening situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Is that the America that we desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| or the legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| that we want for this country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| 287G makes Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| complicit in this national disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| So please, use the power of your seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| and stop this unethical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| and excessive policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| This isn't radical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| and it's not a party issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| These are basic rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| for human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1626)|

| 0:27:14| The next speaker is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Constance Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Constance M. Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Let the record state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| my name is Constance M. Everly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| E-V-E-R-L-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| when I come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| the lady talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| American legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Well, I'm going to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| about American legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| See, I'm African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| There's a legacy that already exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| for slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Let's talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| In slavery times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| that ISIS is doing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| was what was occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| in slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| So the difference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| we had an auction block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| and we went up on the auction block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| And see, they separated our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| based off the highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| But today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| America is not the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| that we already know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| which is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| institutionalized racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| and prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| And that's what we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| when we talk about ICE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| It's an institutionalized racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| and prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| The funny part is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| as David also mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| is that, what was it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| maybe two months exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| we made a cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| to indigent healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Or as David said as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| these are just poor people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| that can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| basic healthcare services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Then you turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| and you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| hey, we got all this extra cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Sheriff Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| how about we fund you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| so we can participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| in the ICE detention concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| that is going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| and in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| and really in our entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| I also look at the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| any form of human rights violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| it's directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| and indirectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| adversely affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| not only the Hispanic population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| the Latino population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| it affects the African American population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| and it affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| the poor people population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| To me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| this is another form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| of allowing the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| to run around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| and find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| to violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| people's personal rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| and freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| of what we give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| under the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| The catch is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| who is the Constitution serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| It says for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| But is it really serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| or a select few?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Who is the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| that really benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| from the Constitution rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| that are given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| And it sure is not the veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| because as a veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I know for a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| my rights are being violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| until I show my ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| as a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Then you want to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| like it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| And as David expressed this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| comes up for election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Some of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| are getting ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| to come up on the auction box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| as I like to call it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| And so when that starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| the people need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| We need to start finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| our candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| that we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| that advocate our voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| when it comes to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| and having these types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| of decisions being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| My biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| when we look at this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| is school is getting restarted back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| These same officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| that claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| that they're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| to keep profiling people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| are going to profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| the very students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| in their classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| I just sat here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| watching the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| school board debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| about putting handcuffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| on students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Are we really having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| that conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| And as David said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| if it was your child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| you would flip your wig back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| knowing somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| put handcuffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| on your child in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| So as David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| and everyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| has already expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| you all need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Or as it's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=1807)|

| 0:34:08| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| to bring an end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| to this racist system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| that's profiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| off the suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| of black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| brown communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| and undocumented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| So, here are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| our demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| we want a police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| budget audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| top-to-bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| We want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| dollar is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Number three, we want a transparent community-led budgeting process leading into the 2021 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| Some of you honestly look shocked and in disbelief right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| And I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Most of you all live in insulated white communities where police don't do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| I'm from a community like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I grew up in white neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Police didn't hurt my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Police didn't treat me like criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| But now that I see what's going on, and now that I understand what's going on, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| that you all understand what's going on by what we're telling you here today, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| to come together to demand change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| We're not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| In fact, it was pretty hard to get people here on a five o'clock on Monday with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| the crazy work schedules because most of us here are working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| We're regular people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| We're not insiders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| But there are thousands of us here in Knoxville who are ready and we're ready for change and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| we're sick and tired of the status quo because we believe in liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| And that has to include black communities, brown communities, and undocumented communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2143)|
| 0:35:53| These mics are kind of light on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I think we had everyone spoke actually below five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I'd like Laura Miller next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Laura, if you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Laura, if you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| I'm Laura Miller, 9504 Mobile Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I'd like to say I agree with all the other people who've spoken very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| I am not a public speaker and I don't like to come and talk to people like this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| things have gotten worse and worse and people have to stand up and speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| We've all heard about how immigrants are being treated at the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| We all know if we've paid attention that it's completely unacceptable and wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| Now we might feel like, well, there's not a whole lot that a county commission or Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| government can do to stop children dying down at the border, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| But we can affect the 287G agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| I contacted the sheriff's office recently and got an email back saying, well, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| really the sheriff's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| And of course, the sheriff is the one who made the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| He's the one who needs to stop the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| But all of you here know the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| You see the sheriff, I assume, during your work from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I would like to ask every one of you who is a moral human being, every time you see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| sheriff, please ask him, have you stopped sending human beings to concentration camps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2247)|
| 0:37:38| Have you stopped helping to separate families, families who live in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2258)|
| 0:37:46| There's a woman that I heard about last year when I first started hearing about these kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| of things happening here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| She used to work at El Charro, the restaurant that my husband would go to all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| And I'm not from her family, I don't know her family, but she was a legal resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| She was a green card holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| And ICE came and knocked on her door, arrested her in front of her son, took her to Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| probably on to Louisiana after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| There was no due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| There was no way for her to say, look at my green card, I'm allowed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| She was separated from her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I don't know if she ever came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| She could still be separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| It can happen to anyone who happens to look Hispanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| How are you going to prove that you're a citizen if there's no due process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| We are breaking our own laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| This is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| It's terribly immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| And any person who has any kind of honor or morality has to stand up and stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2327)|
| 0:38:57| So I don't see the sheriff here today, but I want to ask him, too, to stop cooperating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| with ICE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Stop breaking up our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| It needs to stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| All right, my fellow commissioners, we've got four other guests who have also signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2353)|
| 0:39:24| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I'm inclined to go ahead and just finish this so we can move on with the meeting, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| we do have a second forum at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| There's four guests who have already signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| That was Laura, and you came in two minutes under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| All right, Rebecca Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| State your name and—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| My name is Rebecca Loy, L-O-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| I was born in Knoxville 64 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I've spent 55 years of my life here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I grew up in Farragut, went to Houston, came back in the 80s, lived in the Bluegrass area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| and moved to District 1 11 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| It's been an interesting education going from East Tennessee to a multicultural, multiracial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| city like Houston, coming back to West Knoxville, and then moving east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| There have been a lot of things I've gotten to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| The thing that struck me so far in this meeting was the commissioner's prayer, where he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| that leadership is not watching and correcting, it is listening and connecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| I would hope, and I've watched, and I'm going to tell you, I was very impressed that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| seemed like you all are actually listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| I've been to other public meetings where it looks like the people there have checked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| but I feel like you are listening, and I hope you're really hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| There's not a lot that I have in common with a lot of the people I'm sitting with over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| But I 100% agree with them about most everything that they've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| 287G is immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| I would imagine most of you sitting behind this desk that you go to church on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| There are literally hundreds of verses about how you treat the immigrant, the stranger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| the alien, and you don't drag them from their homes and throw them in the county jail for $74 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| I mean, that is just heinous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| If this is truly the sheriff's decision that you all say, no, we're not giving you your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| until you stop this program, I think you will be surprised at the response you get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2500)|
| 0:41:49| your constituents because everybody in America is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2515)|
| 0:42:06| By the way, in case you didn't have a phone, there's a flood watch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| I think looking out the window, we can all probably tell that that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| All right, and by the way, just for our records, Rebecca, what was your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| I think we just said you're District 1, 1701 Jefferson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Sonia, and the way this is written, Sonia, if you could just approach and then state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| I'm afraid I'll mispronounce your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| I'm Sonia Uriarte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| If you could just name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| I'm from 37918 Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| I'm here to tell you that I'm Hispanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| We have a big Hispanic community, and it feels very uncountable what you're doing to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2579)|
| 0:43:08| I don't understand why you are targeting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| What in the world wrong we did to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2591)|
| 0:43:20| We have families that we want to – we didn't do – I mean, you need to understand something, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2600)|
| 0:43:29| In this country, if you're undocumented, you can still pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| We pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| We pay taxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| So we pay taxes, and you treat us as criminals, as we do not belong to anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| We're not humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| We don't have feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| We have families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| We have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| And you separate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Just because we didn't put correctly the seat belt, people go to jail and be deported just for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| Now, we are the first that we want security, specifically because in our countries, we don't have this security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2647)|
| 0:44:16| I totally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| I don't want a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| I have a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| I totally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| I don't want a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| I have a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| I don't want a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| We're not criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| We don't want a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| We are the first ones that we understand what is being lived in around – being surrounded by criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| So we don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| So don't use this as excuse that you cannot take care of the community, because we are part of the community, and we do pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2681)|
| 0:44:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| So please don't forget about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| And if you want to do something, ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you, Sonia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Clark Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| Clark Allison from 55290 Lane Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| I question the reasons that the Sheriff's Department wants to participate in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Some of the other speakers have already mentioned what they think it's for, so I won't repeat those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| What are the benefits to the Knox County citizens that are paying for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I read where it's been stated that it will save the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| But in two studies done in North Carolina where the same program was implemented, it appears it's costing much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2740)|
| 0:45:48| Can we know unfairly targeting people of color?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Do we know the numbers for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| It seems to me like a more cost-effective approach would be to make it easier to obtain legal status and stop separating families in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2756)|
| 0:46:07| I've been lucky enough to have made friends with some people over the last few years that are advocating for immigrant rights and fair treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| promoting trust in law enforcement, and a faster path to citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| This seems counter to that initiative, and I am here to support their opposition to continuing this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Sarah Hutchinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| My name is Sarah Margaret Hutchinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| I live at 1200 Mount Olive Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| Most of what I have written has already been said, but I want to restate that 287G is a voluntary contract between local law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2808)|
| 0:47:00| And 287G gives some local law enforcement officers the authority to enforce federal immigration law, essentially doing ICE's job for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2820)|
| 0:47:13| Also of note, the local law enforcement officers who want to or who are selected to question people on their status, run people through programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2833)|
| 0:47:26| where they have to go to a several-week training where they learn how to do this stuff, which takes more time out of their duties here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| 287G has been active in Knox County since 2017, and recently a one-year extension was signed on the original two-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2853)|
| 0:47:44| Along with 287G, KCSO holds a separate contract with ICE that allows them to be paid $67 a day for every person held as an immigration detainee in the already overcrowded jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2864)|
| 0:48:06| We're having some problems with the microphones tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| This looks like a financial incentive to engage in racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| If you, I, or anyone in this room look at the data, the majority of ICE-related charges stem from traffic stops and other non-violent misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2893)|
| 0:48:23| These arrests that lead people to being booked into jail and run through a system are done on a discretionary basis, which means that officers get to choose whether they bring somebody in or write them a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2903)|
| 0:48:36| KCSO has consistently engaged in practices that limit open and honest communication with community members about their participation in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2916)|
| 0:48:46| To my knowledge, only once have they agreed to sit down with concerned community members and could not be reached for a follow-up meeting with the same individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2926)|
| 0:48:55| The public 287G steering committee meeting that is supposed to happen yearly occurred last year on July 11, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| As of now, a date for this year's required meeting has yet to be announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| This spring, when KCSO was approached with over 400 postcards asking the agency not to renew this contract, we were denied a meeting and had to leave the letters with a receptionist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2948)|
| 0:49:19| That is why I'm standing here today as a constituent and concerned Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| I'm here to state my opposition to the county I live, work, and vote in participating in 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| KCSO's participation in this program serves a racist agenda that will be remembered as a stain on our local and national history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| KCSO's participation in this program is directly contributing to the separation of families here and nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| as well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the detention facilities we are sending the people in our jails to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=2986)|

| 1:12:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair. We met at the Rules Committee and came up with these rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| They've been vetted in the Rules Committee and also discussed in work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| We chose to lump these all together because it seemed that we had a consensus that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| would all be approved to do it in one vote instead of piecemealed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| Okay. Is there any discussion? I read everything that came to us, and it seems to reflect everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| that we discussed at the work session, and everything looks like a great way to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| it more efficient. So, is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4405)|

| 1:14:06| we have two items. The next two items on our agenda are related to tax financing, and both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| of these will require a roll call vote. So, now for Item 52, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4456)|

| 1:14:29| Okay. Is there any discussion on this particular item? I know we vetted it and talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| it in great detail at the work session last week. Todd, are you okay if we just pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4473)|

| 1:15:57| regarding approval of the payment in lieu of tax pilot transaction with Blueprint Group LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4557)|

| 1:16:36| Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4596)|

| 1:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4603)|
| 1:16:52| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| It was better until you said his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| It's okay. I'm fine. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Sir, in our documentation, we still have the owed assessments on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| Do you know at what time that will be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| And if we vote on this, does it bind it at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Question for the Law Department or Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| I believe that will be as soon as the assessor can revisit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| It should be in the next few weeks. They're going to reassess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| David, we have an amendment, I believe, that's been introduced to this that will allow me to sign off on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| at least at the city end, once the new assessment is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| But the plan is that before it goes to the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| there will be a reappraisal of the property to its present value where the sale is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| and that will be what the pilot will be based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| All right, thank you, Mr. Lyons. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| Dr. Lyons, I've got a question for you, too. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| At the city council meeting last week, they talked about the number of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| When you were here Monday, it was 225, but it's gone up, and there may be room for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| Could you tell us that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Right. I think we're more optimistic that there could be even more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| But what we are going to do is work with the IDB to put in their standard way to ensure that those jobs are here as a component of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4693)|
| 1:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| So we're anticipating it could be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| I mean, this is a very fast-growing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Three, four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Well, it could be an existing 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| The initial will initially go with the figures we've talked about in terms of binding them through the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| which is the numbers that you have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| And we'll have the IDB figure out the appropriate way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Okay, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Yes, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| This is a good use of taxpayer incentives to create high-paying jobs for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| We're very pleased to bring it to you and appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| Seeing no other lights, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| All in favor of this motion, we all need to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Hey, I was going to get to the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| So we will now have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| The last one was led by Commissioner Biggs, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| So the next one moving on will be Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| Can you do Commissioner Carringer since it's in her district and then just come back to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4768)|

| 1:19:53| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| Commissioner Beeler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Commissioner Daly votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Commissioner Jay votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Commissioner Biggs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| All members leave the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| No changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| I'll verify this with the clerk's office, but I am not seeing any ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| I'm not seeing any ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| What I'd like to do is go ahead and knock out the discussion on the volunteer fire license plates brought to us by Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| and then follow that with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Commissioner Daly, are you prepared to lead that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Chief John Linsenbegler is here from the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| I'm going to turn my time over to him because I will be introducing an ordinance next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| so we'll be able to talk about it more next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| But I want him to hear to explain about his volunteer fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| And also, I just found out a few minutes ago, this also includes the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| So, Chief John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Last year, the Senate passed a bill, SB270, changing part of the motor vehicle registration tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| It states that volunteer firefighters and rescue squad members will exempt them from the payment of the regular registration fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| at the time of the renewal of their license plates issued to a volunteer firefighter or rescue squad member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| The other counties that we serve in, Blount and Sevier County, have passed this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| And just trying to make it to show that, just in a small way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| to show your appreciation to the volunteers that are in the fire service and the rescue squad that serve Knox County in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| Any questions at all about the bill or about implementation of it or how our policy is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| How the other counties do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| It's like we typically do for the Knox County clerk every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I give them a list of our volunteers and when they have to go get their F tags, their firefighter tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| They have to be authorized on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| The bill clearly states that the fire chief or the captain of the rescue squad is to provide this annually, which we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| which we've been doing for years for the F tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| This just reduces that fee that's in the county for registration fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| All right, makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Okay, so the dollar amount that it would be waived would be, is it the $29 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| Basically, it's up to the governing body, the local governing body, of what the registration fee is for each particular county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| Okay, well, our state registration fee is $29, and then we have a $36 wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| So what are you asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| I think it's just the registration fee, not necessarily the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| The other counties have just removed the registration fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| Okay, that's what I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| So just the $29?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| That's a fairly small fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| It is, but like I said, it's just kind of saying thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Is there any other questions or discussion related to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| No, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Commissioner Gill, we'll discuss this more next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| Okay, but go ahead and recognize Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| She may help tape a question for next month, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| I just wanted to know how many people we're speaking of that will be impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| In our roster for those residents that live in Knox County, there's approximately 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| We have 70 volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Approximately about 12 of those live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| The rescue squad, I've heard numbers around 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| How many of those actually live in Knox County, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| because some of their technical rescue teams are brought out of counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| But it's just for the county residents in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Minimal numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Like I said, it's just that little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| Okay, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I read the law that I think somebody had sent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Is it full-time or just volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Just volunteers, no paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| So, like the city of Knoxville and those that are paid and compensated are not allowed, would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| I wouldn't mark them asterisked on here, or they wouldn't come from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| But if we have volunteers, a true volunteer of their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| like we have gentlemen from rural metro, KFD, rescue squad, if they're paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| but they volunteer for us, that's how the law reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| So they would be exempt from that registration fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| And it's reviewed annually because volunteers, it turns over quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Thank you for your time and consideration, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| And Commissioner Daley, thank you for getting this on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| We'll look forward to getting that squared away next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Next item on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| Is there anyone who did not speak at the first public forum that would like to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5084)|
| 1:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Drusilla, has anybody signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Seeing none, I think that concludes our business for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| I know we've got a long zoning meeting coming up at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| Right now, I would like to give the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| if there's any announcements that you'd like to make before we take a break before the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Any announcements out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5116)|

| 1:25:35| I want to thank Commissioner Buehler for that reminder, as I will be the pie judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| I heard they had 3.14 pie judges at that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| I just want to remind everybody, looking forward to our strategic planning retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| which will be this Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| I look forward to everybody's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| And we have a very full agenda for two days and look forward to everyone's engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Commissioner Skidmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| I just wanted to remind the members of the commission that they're invited to meet the new Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Wednesday afternoon at 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Go ahead, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| I'm proud to say that South Knoxville, we are going to start a veterans' breakfast for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| It will be the second Saturday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| It will be at Pathways Church off of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| It will start at 8 o'clock, and we'll try to be done by 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| But it first will be September 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| So, veterans out there, you're invited, yourself and a guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| and it's going to be the best veterans' breakfast in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| One announcement I'll make briefly, and then I'll recognize Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| We talked about this a while back, and his schedule did not permit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| but I know we all wanted to take an opportunity to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| and thank Octopo for winning the Bassmasters Classic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| and we also wanted to use that as an opportunity to thank Visit Knoxville for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| and some of these other events they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| They've really been nailing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| We were going to recognize Ott at this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| but as many of you all probably followed, he had some unexpected heart challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| I've been in communication with Kim Bumpus and penciled this in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| but we're planning on recognizing him, his family, the Bassmasters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| and Kim's group at the October 28th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| So I know that's far out there, but I also just want to let you all know we had not let that slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| It's been kind of continually working on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| I just want to remind Commissioner Daley that when you're the first veterans' breakfast in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| we set the bar awfully high, so he has to really do a good job in his area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| But what I want to tell you about, we had the women's tournament this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| There were 34, I believe, participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| And the tournament that they came from, some of them came from San Diego,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| so they came all the way here to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| And I think we did an impressive job with those ladies, and I think they'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| And I did play in that tournament on Friday for a little bit right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| and my male ego is still very hurt with the way that they played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| So anyway, listen, thank you all for letting us have that tournament out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| and we'll bring some more into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| Okay, thank you, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| The Chair will entertain a motion for dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| We're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| Good evening, and welcome to the July meeting of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| which is dedicated to zoning and land matters for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| I'm going to ask the clerk's office to please call roll for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5336)|

| 1:29:00| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Commissioner Beehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Okay, before we jump immediately into tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| I wanted to advise some of our folks we've got here tonight that I did receive about five minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5361)|
| 1:29:30| a text message from Taylor Forster for Natural Reach Realty Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| That is item number 70 on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| We will discuss this formally when we get to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| but I do want to tell some of the guests we have here tonight that Mr. Forster texted me their intent to withdraw the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5383)|
| 1:29:51| My response to him was that thank you, but if he could also send me an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| so I've got additional backup on that intent to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| I'm Patra Rule from Keller Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| We're just wondering if they remove their appeal or drop it, can they reapply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| I think it would be a one-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| I'll look to Mr. Green for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| Our rules of procedure treat a withdrawal the same as a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| meaning they cannot apply for a substantially similar zoning designation for a year without the planning commission's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| Without going back through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| So then if they are denied, then is it going to be the Board of Zoning Appeals that is going to enforce the violation of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5435)|
| 1:30:43| That would be up to County Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Yes, it would be up to Codes from that moment moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| And I'll work with you all to communicate that to the property owner as well as the Codes Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| And thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Okay, but do we want to take action on that now so these folks can go home before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| That's my intent because I know we've got a big group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| That's why I wanted to move that forward because it just struck me as a good idea to go ahead and deal with that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| even though it was last on our agenda so the folks who are here regarding that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| So, Madam Clerk, if you could do this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| The item I'm talking about is item number 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| So if we could move to item 70 quick, if you could read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| and then I'll recognize Mr. Green and then formally acknowledge that we've received a request for a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5487)|
| 1:31:36| And I'd love to see them leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Is Taylor going to send you that email tonight or is he going to send you that email tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| Because, I mean, if you do that and he changes his mind, it's just a text message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| Unless Mr. Sanders is – I want him to leave too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| Could we not vote to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I have got the email from him in my county email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| He's just sent me it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| It says, Commissioners, my client wishes to withdraw his appeal on the above referenced item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| Respectfully yours, Taylor Forrester, Attorney at Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| I'm good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| So with that said and with our rules that we've recently passed with a little bit of discretion to move the agenda around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| I would like to go ahead and just deal with this item first so that our folks who've come from the neighborhood tonight will be free to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| So, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| This is 4-J-19-RC, appeal by Taylor D. Forrester for Natural Roots Realty Holding, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| for Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission's decision to deny rezoning from A agricultural to T transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| Property is located at 9222 Tedford Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Parcel ID 15504324, south side of Tedford Lane, east of Lakefront Drive in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5566)|
| 1:32:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| I was going to say, since it's in your district, if you want to make the motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Okay, I'll make the motion to deny this appeal based on the fact that the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| well, it's actually – it's been withdrawn, so we don't even need to have a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| So it's not something that would actually be coming for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| And if a withdrawal is treated the same as a denial in the eyes of the law, I want to get a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| So it is considered a withdrawal and will not require a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| So we've addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| It is considered a withdrawal, and it requires no additional action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| For those of you who didn't hear him speaking, there's a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| He said that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| So, no, we do not need to vote because it's been formally withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| and we've got email confirmation of that from the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5632)|

| 1:34:49| By limiting the C-B zoning to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| it would provide adequate room for commercial development consistent with the zoning pattern in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| while also providing a buffer to the adjacent residential properties and protecting the steep hillside area of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=5698)|

| 1:40:11| would provide a buffer in transition between the commercial zoning to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6011)|

| 1:40:57| because they recommended more than you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6057)|

| 1:45:48| that this has good access to Rutledge Park and would be inappropriate for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| I recognize the owner of the property, Mr. Davis, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| If you could please, once again, for this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| state your name and address for the record related to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| I'm about worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| I'm wearing you out, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| I would respectfully request this property could be zoned up to five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| which is part of the LDL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| I would respectfully request of the Commission zoning up to 4.7 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| That would be the wishes of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Mr. Davis has noted his request for 4.7 units to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| This is in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| I guess we'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| This would probably trigger some discussion among the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| if there's any concerns on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| And, by the way, I also want to ask the audience, is there any opposition here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| Is there any opposition to this current request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| or the request that Mr. Davis has just made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Was that discussed at the KKPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| Knox Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Yes, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| It was discussed somewhat, and as I stated, staff did acknowledge that with its access to Rumlege Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| it's a place where higher density could be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| It could be accessed without any danger or safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| I'd like to make a motion to approve Mr. Davis' request of 4.7 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Then I'll recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| We have a motion from Commissioner Beeler with a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| Discussion, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| So, Mr. Green, then why didn't the MPC commissioners bump it up then if the applicant had asked for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| The applicant didn't ask for it at the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| I think Mr. Davis was not present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| and I think the person who represented him did not seem accustomed to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| and the way they work, so this seemed to be the appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| I'll speak for Mr. Davis and hope I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| This may be challenging me speaking for Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| but I think Mr. Davis saw this as the proper venue to ask that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| and ask for the density to be bumped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| He did, in his initial request, request 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| Was there anybody from the public that showed up at the time of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| No, and we've received no emails or comments regarding this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| And Mr. Davis actually missed a MPC meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| Is that what you're on the record saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| I can't imagine why he would miss such an exciting event, but he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| He missed a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| Go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Did you go to 4.7, is that what you asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| So you went down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| I want to note on the agenda there, he was one vote short of three unanimous subdivisions in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| so I think we may need to look toward the eastern sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| That always makes me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| When there's no opposition, it makes me really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| Before I make a call to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| I also want to take note that tonight Mr. Green actually represented your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| That really makes me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| You're making me really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| We're all friends, so it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| So, all right, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| The motion was made by Commissioner Beeler and seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| It was for, as requested, the 4.7 units breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| I'm restating that, is that to be perfectly clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Is that correct, Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| All right, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| To the east side, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Thank you all for your time and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| Have a great evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| 6-A-19-SP is request of the Development Corporation of Knox County for East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6610)|
| 1:50:19| from BP-1 Business Park to LDR Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| Property located at 629 Milani Drive, parcel ID 74, part of 096 Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6624)|
| 1:50:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| The Planning Commission, by a vote of 12-0, recommended that the Planning Commission amend the Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6639)|
| 1:50:47| to LDR Low Density Residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| It's on the edge of Midway Business Park but is adjacent to a low-density residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| and would serve as a buffer between the business park and that residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| Therefore, the change in Sector Plan designation is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Is a representative from the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| Ray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Ray Christian, Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Market Square, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| Following through with my process, is there any opposition here to this downzoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Before we move on, I want to compliment the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| This is a very intentional request for a downzone from a more intensive use to a protective use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6686)|
| 1:51:34| If we've been out to the Midway Park, which I've had the pleasure of going out there multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| in particular with Mr. Napier, and I'm just really pleased to see the intentionality of taking some of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| that's part of the park and actually putting it in a classification that does provide a permanent buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6706)|
| 1:51:53| between the park and some of the neighborhoods there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| So, you all should be commended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| So, the Chair will now entertain a motion for this particular zoning matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Beeler, and I actually heard Commissioner Carringer first on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| Stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| You've got the next one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Item 14-RC is the request of the Development Corporation of Knox County for rezoning for EC Employment Center K-2A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6748)|
| 1:52:39| Agricultural Property located at 629 Manila Drive, parcel ID 74, part of 096 in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6759)|
| 1:52:50| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| The Planning Commission recommended that the County Commission approve the agricultural zoning for this 5.8-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| The zoning would be compatible with the sector plan designation just approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| and would provide a buffer between the Midway Industrial Park and the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6791)|

| 1:53:40| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6820)|

| 1:53:46| Item 5A-C-19-SP is request of Weston Pabley for Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6826)|
| 1:53:53| from LDR Low Density Residential to RC Rural Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| property located at 5821 Pabley Road, parcel ID 4910201 in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6837)|
| 1:54:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| A vote attended to, the Planning Commission amended the Sector Plan to an RC Rural Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| designation for this property and recommended that the County Commission also amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| The property was formally used as part of a greenhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| It's largely covered with concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| The Sector Plan designation, as requested, would allow zoning, which would enable uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| of the property that could help improve the property and the surrounding properties by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| putting a viable and economically productive use on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6888)|

| 1:54:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| Is there any opposition here tonight to this particular zoning matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| Seeing none, the Chair will entertain a motion followed by a discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Mr. Chairman, I have a question for Mr. Pabley, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| I'll recognize Commissioner Beeler first and then Biggs second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| Mr. Pabley, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Could you describe briefly what plans you may have for the property and the reason for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| the request of the change in the Sector Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| What we're trying to do is just keep our 100-year-old farm going for another 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| The only way to do that as being the only son is to do more of an event center where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| we have axe throwing and goat yoga, craft festivals such as that, instead of trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| to take the 134 acres and use beef cattle or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| With the low resources I have and the experience I have of 15 years of programming, I can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| It opens up an avenue that we just have never tried before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Commissioner Biggs, do you still have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| That's what I was going to ask, but I'd like to sign Commissioner Beeler up for goat yoga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| It's my understanding that, correct me if I'm wrong, goat yoga is kid-friendly, isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| They even have reindeer yoga now and heifer yoga and all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| One serious question and then I'll move to Schoonmaker and Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| Some of these things you're proposing are all allowable by the Tennessee Right to Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| Act because that would be considered agritourism, I would suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| So many of those things that we will get this zoning cleared up for you, but just for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| record, the Tennessee Right to Farm Act gives you a lot of power in terms of how you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| to use your land in terms of uses that can be pertaining to event centers, things such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| as goat yoga or other things that are all protected activities within the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| Right to Farm Act, which is something you're probably familiar with, but if not, I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| letting you know because that gives you a nice layer of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Moving on, next question is to Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| All right, you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| Mr. Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| Yeah, I just wanted to say this is part of the farm and all where you've always raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| all the beautiful flowers, where I bought my poinsettias and chrysanthemums and bedding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| plants that I miss so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| I want to tell you, you all had the best of the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| My mother and I, we bought there every season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you for wanting to stay in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| If there's any way possible, I'd love for you to bring the plants back because we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| miss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| We're trying our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| I will be your first customer, so good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| We're happy that you're staying in Knox County and trying to make all the acreage there work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| where everybody can enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| The chair will entertain a motion and I will, in all seriousness, Mr. Green, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| email him information about the Tennessee Right to Farm Act, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| So, sorry, Mr. Green, just for kind of delegating that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| That's what I'm here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| All right, Mr. Beeler, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Yes, motion to approve our Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| And a second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| Okay, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7126)|

| 2:00:54| development at that density would be compatible with the surrounding land uses and compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7254)|

| 2:02:13| By a vote of 12-0, the Planning Commission recommended approval of PR zoning at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7333)|

| 2:02:21| Finding that the development of the property at that density would be compatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| surrounding land uses and the development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7345)|

| 2:02:31| Chair notes that came to us on a 12-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Is the owner or representative of the owner present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| Mr. Chairman, Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| And our request is still going back to our original request at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7359)|
| 2:02:46| Let me tell you our rationale behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| We still maintain this small piece of property at the, and we're only talking about a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| of two units, so we go from 10 units to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| And it's not like we're having to shoehorn in to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| We have a development plan that shows that this works very reasonably for this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| There are two or three other pieces of property within probably 400 or 500 feet that are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| zoned at five dwelling units per acre, so it's not like we're recreating some high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| in the middle of a lower density area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| And we just, we believe that if a property can be developed at a higher density, rationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| so, then we should do that because we've seen the effects of taking properties that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| developed at too low a density and now we're having to develop some that shouldn't be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| frankly, at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| So we think this fits that pattern pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| If I may add, Mr. Campbell, that the development plan would be subject to review by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| Commission, so any issues, if there were any, would be addressed at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| At use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| Is there any opposition present to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| There are a number of questions before we get to a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| I recognize Commissioner Bussler was the first light that I saw, followed by Jay and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| I was going to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| If you want to go ahead and make the motion, then go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| I've been out there and taken a look at the land also, and I want to make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| we go and do the density at five units as requested because it does come back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7461)|
| 2:04:32| for them to look over the plans to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| So that's my motion to approve this at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| We have a motion from Commissioner Bussler with a second by Commissioner Anders to restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| The motion is to approve this zoning at a density of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| That is the motion that is before us with a proper first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| Now, moving on to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Mr. Green, I'm looking at the map and the documents prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| I'm looking at developments on Wren's Creek Lane, which is nearby Sorrento Road across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7507)|
| 2:05:16| Are these all, as the applicant has said, areas that don't have the zoning of those areas surrounding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7516)|
| 2:05:24| They were zoned at up to five dwelling units per acre, but developed at a lesser density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Mr. Green, I noticed in the staff recommendation to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| they said to zone it for up to four dwelling units per acre when the applicant requested five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7541)|
| 2:05:49| Why was the reason that the Planning Commission split the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| The only reason given was that it was halfway between staff recommendation of four and the applicant's request for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7556)|
| 2:06:04| And the staff wanted four because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| Because of the development pattern in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| How old is the development pattern in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| How old are those developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| That I'm not sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Planning, we're reconsidering that, and sometimes it's hard to change old habits, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7590)|
| 2:06:40| You have to stick with the pattern, and so that's why I've tried to soften the recommendations coming to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| and acknowledge that there is a need for, in appropriate places, greater density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| and again, that the Planning Commission does have the opportunity to review these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| when the development plan is brought forth, and any issue that may occur is addressed at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7617)|
| 2:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Good question, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7628)|

| 2:08:00| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, the Planning Commission, by a vote of 12-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| denied the Sector Plan amendment and recommended denial of the associated rezoning for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| finding that the impact of this zoning designation on the adjacent properties would be substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| Also, the property did not meet the location criteria for the designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| and that the location criteria states that the zoning of this type should be at the intersection of two thoroughfares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| either arterial or collector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| Any additional information, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| Unless you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Is the owner or representative of the owner present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| I'm here for the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| My name is John Valiant, 800 South Gay Street, Knoxville 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| Ma'am, if you could go ahead and come forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| My name is Janice Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| I'm at 1918 Spring Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| I had prepared an email for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| What we're going to do, just for everybody's purposes, both the petitioner and the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| if you're prepared to speak on this, I'm going to grant each of you all the opportunity to speak about this appeal that has come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7766)|
| 2:09:33| I'm going to ask the administrators here to give you all each about six minutes to speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7773)|
| 2:09:41| Then, afterwards, there will probably be questions by some of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| Does that sound good to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| I'm going to go ahead and give the floor to the petitioner first to speak, and then I'll allow you to follow him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| Does that sound okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| I'll observe my time and let them go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| You've got the chance to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| We're having a hard time hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| These mics have been acting up all night, although the storm slowed down there a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| Can everybody hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| I'm requesting that the Planning Commission deny the Sector Plan amendment and the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7818)|
| 2:10:25| As indicated, the staff had made recommendations and compelling reasons to not approve the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7825)|
| 2:10:35| from changing it from rural agricultural to rural commercial, or rural commercial from the low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7835)|
| 2:10:46| This is located on John Speer Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| As were approved, it impacts an already limited residential section in this highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7849)|
| 2:10:56| There's only approximately 2.5 miles in this section on John Speer, which needs to be maintained as low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7856)|
| 2:11:06| The commercial business would be right at a curve on John Speer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| There's no traffic light in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| There's no, as the Commissioner said, no arterial roads, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7873)|
| 2:11:23| It would adversely affect the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| It's a blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| On the other side of the river from this location, there's already an industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| with approximately 33 industrial businesses right on John Speer Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| If you'll recall, this is designated a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| The location of the proposed rezoning and change of sector plan is adjacent to KUB, opposite of Crossroads Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7909)|
| 2:11:58| as well as across from the Tennessee Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| Increased commercial development would, in this area, start a new trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7922)|
| 2:12:11| which is my understanding is something that the Commission is hoping not to do in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7931)|
