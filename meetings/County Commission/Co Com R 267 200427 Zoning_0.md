| 0:00:00| Uh, good evening and welcome to the zoning a part of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| Commission. Uh, meeting cycle for the month of April. Uh, tonight with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6)|
| 0:00:12| is an extension of the first meeting. So I guess technically this really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| not a separate meeting, although we did have a brief recess while we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=16)|
| 0:00:21| log back into the separate zoom meeting. Uh, you're watching this meeting back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=21)|
| 0:00:27| home. Uh, which probably most of you are. Uh, just explain a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=27)|
| 0:00:32| things logistically. Uh, one reason why you're wondering why we had to do two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| separate zoom meetings. If you through your family or business or for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| reason you've been doing zoom, you realize that there's sort of a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| folks that lock in and you have different waiting rooms to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| manage all the folks that are participants. And when you look at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| county commission meeting, there's a whole bunch of folks that had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| part of the county commission meeting, and all of those folks had absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| nothing to do with all the folks here here for this part of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| which is based on evaluating and take a look at land use matters and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| matters. So that's why we had to put kind of a hard close to the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| and then open up this new zoom and begin the second meeting. But if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| truly just watching on CTV, then it's probably the same feed, and it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| be relatively seamless. So another couple of points of clarification. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| we have got this is a catch up meeting March when all of the crisis related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| stuff just hit. We didn't know exactly where things were gonna land. So in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| opinion, it was in our best interest to go ahead and cancel the meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| postpone it. We got through the first zoom meeting, and now I think we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| frankly, all of us collectively are a lot better at doing this. So it felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| like we could finally open it back up to more zooming until a larger type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| venue. So that's why we're here. But because of not having the meeting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| March, we've now sort of got a double sized agenda this month. And when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| putting the agenda together, we, um, try to stack it in order so that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| know, towards the end of the agenda, that's when we're gonna be handling the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| things that were originally scheduled for April. And, uh, can you hear the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| barking in the background? Okay. Uh, somebody's at the front door. He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| going crazy. So, uh, so if so, that's a kind of a reason a while how some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| the agenda got said it's the way the dog's name is spanking. I'll be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| and maybe share a picture with you all later of him. So, uh, but with all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| said, we'll go ahead and begin on the tonight's agenda. When we set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| original zone agenda at the top of the opening of the meeting to be noted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| item number 40 is deferred, and all the commissioners received communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| about that in advance of the meeting. So, uh, Madam Clerk, would you please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| uh, call the next item on the agenda? The first time? Oh, we do need to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| roll. Uh, yeah, we can do another roll call, please. Go ahead, Ben. Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| call roll and then open with the next item. First item, Mr Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| present. Mr Carringer present. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=189)|
| 0:03:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| I can't hear you, but I see you. Commissioner Smith. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Nystrom here. Commissioner Soon maker here. Mr Anders here. Mr Bustler here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| Commissioner Baylor here. Mr Daly here. Commissioner J. Here, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Biggs. All members are present. All right. Very good. Thank you. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| another point of clarification before, frankly, the dogs are threw me off a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| little bit is we, uh, you know, the direction in the announcement for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| meeting as well as what's what's on the agenda on on these land use issues. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| we receive some feedback from someone who is in opposition to any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| land use issues, I've directed Jerusalem to reach out to them so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| we can have a point counterpoint at this meeting. So in that case, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| really, frankly, I think we only had one item that drew some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Otherwise, most of the agenda items that came to us really did not have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| whole lot of opposition to him, and most came to us on from either consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| or unanimous votes. But we've done our best to make sure that if there is any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| opposition that they all get are heard tonight, and I believe everybody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| has received zoning or excuse me, it's hard to say, uh, zoning zooms. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| everybody has received a link to this zoom that, uh, had a matter. I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| to speak out on a zoning matter. So with that said, we'll now open up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| the first item. Go ahead, Mr Chairman. Yes, Mr Schoonmaker. Daniel Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| had his hand up law director's office. All right, I'll go ahead. Sorry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| that. I've been. He may have been down towards the ball. All right, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| All right. Go ahead, Mr Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Just one item of housekeeping before we get going on the first item. There is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| commission rule that requires the attendance of the applicant. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| the governor's executive order 16 gave us authority to suspend that rule. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| don't know if, uh, the applicants have all received the zoom link and are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| attendance. I know there are a couple, but just out of abundance of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| maybe I would I would advise you to take a vote and suspend its rule seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| section F of the commission rules. So moved. All right. We have a motion from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| Commissioner J. Is there a second? Second. Justin Biggs. Second from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Commissioner Biggs. So to restate what we're voting on is we have a rule, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| that we operate on that states that any applicant has to be present and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| rule. Uh, we want to make sure that we've done away with that. Also, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| that rule so we can be a full compliance and make it just frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| more seamless and easy. Comply with the governor's order. That is what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| voting on. Adam Park. Uh, before I have the vote, Commissioner Anders, or did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| you? Uh, you've got a question or statement. All right, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Anders, you recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| more of a statement. I think that if we look at, uh, if some of the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| are not here and we proceed forward in this through air or they didn't submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| to be taken off the list or we need to have on the back end of this, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| to have remedy for them. If something was done without their presence, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| think that we, as a county and NPC ought to act in accordance to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| because they may have thought this was over and done with. And if there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| a if an applicant's not here, I don't want to change their property without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| their permission and consent. I know that there's an application, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| need to have a remedy for that on the other side. Well, what would that be? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| mean, would that be kind of for lack of a better word? And Daniel can weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| on this. And then, uh, by the way, I'm recognizing your statement. I've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Daniel, and then I'm gonna go back to Commissioner Smith. He's got his light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| on. I'm not sure what the proper remedy would be. Otherwise, it could be, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| I'm just throwing this out there. We anything that's passed where an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| applicant is not present, it maybe does not go into effect for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| month so that we have time to circle back to them. I'm not sure if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| would would make sure. And then we could remedy it at the next commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| meeting. I'll direct that to the law department, Mr Sanders. And then we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| got Commissioner Smith. He's got his light on. If you do not suspend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| rule, you will continue to operate under the rule. And if an applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| not present at the meeting, then the application will kick to the heels of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| the meeting. And then if they're not here the second time, the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| is is read into the, uh, read into the meeting. Then it will be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I'm I'm okay with that. I'm just saying if if we pass something and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| somebody's not here, I'm okay with suspending the rules. But if we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| allow them a free opportunity, we need to send him a certified letter, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| something, allow them a free opportunity to come back and say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| is not what I can send it to. I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| I would. I would almost say, uh, sergeant. Second, Mr Smith. If we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| to somebody, they're not here. I suspect that somebody in the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| office has probably got all their contact information and can also call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| him to just see if they got the links. I mean, we we sent all links out based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| on the email addresses that we had. Uh, Mr Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Uh, I guess this question is for Gerald Green. It's my understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=520)|

| 0:09:01| probably a better question for Mr Sanders. But in looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| applications, well, first, let me say, I think the safe way in response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| Commissioner Anders request is not to waive the rule so that they're notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=551)|

| 0:09:55| present, we can deal with it at that time. We can handle it in a way like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| meeting and put it to the back and give a chance to see if they missed the link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=599)|

| 0:10:11| just handle everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Uh, I don't wanna say case by case. We gotta be consistent in our rules. But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| uh, yeah, I don't have a problem moving even if we waive the rule tonight. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| then we still just as a matter of the way we handle it, we can still we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=621)|

| 0:10:36| anyhow, that's that's my take. So, uh, we've got, uh, has there been a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=636)|

| 0:20:41| postpone it. Um, and just perform just for more discussion because there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| 42 43 pages worth of community input on this. And so what we're what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| asking is nothing out of the ordinary of what's already here. The 3.5 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| units per acre. That's what all the other three subdivisions on Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| School Road within a mile have been developed out to. Um, and and so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| they were, this was approved at five billion units per acre, we just see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| that is too high a density for this particular plot of land. Um, it's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| Thompson School Road. There's not been any improvements to Thompson School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Road. Um, there are there's currently construction at Thompson School in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Emory Road. Um, but what all that's doing is matching it with Fairview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| because there were too many accidents, too many people ran into that, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| ran into that problem on Emory. Um, so that's just a safety concern at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| Thompson School in Emory. Thompson School Road itself has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| improved. Um, the other issue we're running into just it's a broader issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| is, um, the connectivity of this area. Yes, it's in a planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| However, um, there's not been any infrastructure. There's not been any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| connectivity improvements done to this area to facilitate that growth. Um, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| so going to 12 5 billion units per acre is much higher than what this area can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| withstand with the current infrastructure we have. Um, the if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| look at Google Maps and I know we sent you all a PDF with the image of Google| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Maps showing where actually taking Thompson School Road to Karnes Road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Barker over to Tazewell is a faster route to get to the schools. Because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| yes, we do have gifts and elementary, high and middle schools in one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| But taking Karnes Road, which some folks have even called a pig bath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| which is basically all it is, um, to get to the schools is a faster route than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| taking Thompson School to Emory. Um, and so once folks realize that and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| have congestion at Thompson School Road, Emory Road intersection, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| congestion at a Tazewell Pike Emory Road intersection with the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| light going to schools. It would be much more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| user friendly for the area just to skip through Karnes Road. Well, in during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| this construction at Emory and Thompson School, it was shut down. So everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| in these three subdivisions and beyond had to take Karnes Road if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| going to get to the schools for Tazewell Pike to head towards Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| City or Halls. And so the residents on Karnes Road, I know most of you are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| members of the Corrigan Connection Facebook page and all that. But those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| residents were constantly complaining about the traffic and the safety and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| they were tearing up their driveways. They're turning up their yards because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| there's not enough room for two cars to pass. It's not a line road. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| wide enough for that. And so that's the connectivity issue we're running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| into there. And there's only one access point to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| There's not a back road connectivity to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| The access point is on Thompson School Road. The only access point looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| at the proposed, I guess, development plans would be an access point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| the back of Wheat Meadows connecting subdivision. However, its only access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| point is also on Thompson School Road. So then you're hitting it either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| way. And that's what we're running into. And I know that we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| new middle school, elementary school is fairly new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| but even still, these are... Let's see, I've got it here. According to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| Knox County Schools, the high school is at 81% capacity. The Gibbs Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1481)|

| 0:24:51| The elementary school is at 90% capacity and they just added their seventh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| fourth grade classroom, obviously, before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| schools were canceled for the rest of the year. But they had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| add a seventh, fourth grade classroom. So we're already starting to stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| the limit of what our infrastructure and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| I guess, amenities for the community are. We don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| We don't have bike paths. We have the Ruiton Park. We have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| Gibbs Elementary School playground. But kids are playing in the streets of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| subdivisions because they can't get to them. And our subdivisions don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| parks, playgrounds, sidewalks. We don't have any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| So during this shutdown, where school's out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| I've got kids playing in our subdivision up and down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| and they have no place else to play because they can't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| to any of it. So that's what we're running into with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| I think, overall, we would like to see... We know development's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| And so what we do here sets a precedent on what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| moving forward. Are we just gonna... A developer shows up and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| hey, I want this. It fits within the planned growth guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| NPC staff says, okay, let's do it. And NPC commission approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| and they just get it. Or do we actually have a conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| the developers, and developers come to us and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| we understand this is your limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| But if we just rubber stamp everything that comes across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| with no plan of how we move forward, then it's just gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| hodgepodge mess of whatever we get. And then once the development is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| place, we have to live with it. And not only do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| to live with it, the new residents who have moved in, because at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| 5 billion years break, you're talking about 190 plus units. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| those residents who were sold a wonderful community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| everything's here. You've got a grocery store, a gas station, all the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| you need right here. But once they get here, now it's cramped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| they can't get anywhere, traffic's bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| and then there's nothing for their kids to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| So we're just trying to... We would love to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| of how we move forward. And as commissioners, we're asking you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| really look hard at this idea of how do we plan to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| forward, instead of just saying, yep, we had this application come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| if it's in the mold, let's just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| And so we would like to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| And so, yeah, that's really where we're at on this, particularly for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| development. Carnes Road as a back road access point for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| to get to the schools is just not feasible. It's not safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| it's not feasible, and it doesn't do the residents on Carnes or Barker Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| any favors. So that's where we are. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| All right. Thank you. The chair recognizes Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| Now, thank you all for your time, and thank you, Mr. Thomson, for your input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| there. And I think NBC approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| five units an acre, and I think the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| are asking for 3.5 units an acre, and I'm willing to compromise and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| them in the middle. And so if it's incumbent upon the commission here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| I would agree to the 4.25 units an acre and reduce it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| to 4.25 if everybody's comfortable with that. Okay. I'm open to having some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| further questions and some follow up on it before we entertain a motion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| this. Let me pull up my screen here so I can try to track any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1725)|
| 0:28:53| All right. First of all, the chair recognizes with that Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| and Commissioner Anders and then Commissioner Jay. So, Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| first. Oh, yeah. I was going to tell you I had the timer going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| but Mr. Thomson's got one minute and 10 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Yeah. I was going to say, Mr. Thomson, you can keep going unless you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| got your...wanted to say some more. I mean, I'm trying to be as flexible as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| possible with this just within some general guidelines, knowing how awkward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| it is doing this through Zoom. Mr. Chairman, Kevin Murphy is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| I could speak for about a minute. Okay. All right. Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| you're recognized if you'd like to speak for about a minute or so or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I do have video available if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| like to turn that on. So, this area is an area in the Northeast County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Sector Plan that's called out as a special use mixed district area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| So, this is an area that we've actually identified and we've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| yes, through the planning process, this is an area we want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| Recommendations, it has some...we've done some infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| So, we've had schools. That's good. Usually, we're fighting that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| But we really need to actually figure out how do you grow a community like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Gibbs that's out on the edge of the rural area that has these transit links| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| back into the rest of the county that actually needs to grow employment because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| the residents there primarily don't work in that area. They have to commute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| And that doesn't have any pedestrian connectors. It's really quite a shame that there's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| sidewalk that's there that connects Gibbs Middle, Gibbs Elementary, and the Exxon gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| That's the only sidewalk in the community. So, there's...so, really, I think the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| the community's up saying, please slow this request down is because there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| infrastructure improvement that needs to happen to help build this community. And this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| opportunity to bring it up to maybe start the small area plan for out there and figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| how to do these better. But for now, maybe new development out there is a little bit ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| the cart before the horse because we haven't quite got our plan together yet out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| Chair recognizes Commissioner Anders. Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Mr. Davis, you said the 4.25. What's the difference in the house numbers on the number of houses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| that 5.25? I believe it's 20. I can't remember the total number of acreage. Mr. Green, you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| have that in front of you. Yes, sir. The total acreage is 43 acres. So, that's about three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| quarters of a unit per acre. So, about 30 differences, about 30 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you. And I think when we talk about this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| there's been employment opportunity out there and the community turned it down with Hackney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| There's been a request for schools. So, 15, 16 years ago, we built the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Just a couple of years ago, we added a middle school back to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| which it very much deserved. The state has spent millions of dollars, tons of time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| on Tassel Pike and Emory Road. I mean, there have been infrastructure increases up there. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| it's just like the rest of the part of the counties that, you know, my road is a car and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| half. They're all over the county. And if we talked about raising the revenue to get all that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| there'd be just as much discussion against that, too. So, you know, my area, Hardin Valley, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| want to take a four-lane road all the way from Pellissippi to Watt Road. And the community said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| stop at Steel Road. Now they're upset that there's not more infrastructure out there. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| I mean, all these decisions that we try to make, we can't seem to make everybody happy from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| decade to the next. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Anders, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| Are you good? Are you done? All right. Commissioner Jay, then Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| wanted to hear from Jim Snowden if there were any infrastructure improvements or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| slated for Thompson Station Road in any time in the next decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| No, Commissioner, there are not. The email I'd sent you guys previously kind of looked upon our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| crash analysis out there. We're not seeing any crashes at that location that would justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:24| the expenditure of funds at this point in time. It's crashes below statewide average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| for a similar characteristic road in regard to width and alignment. So, from our perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| we don't see any improvements in the near-term future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| Tell you what, I might follow up on that. Commissioner Jay, would you like Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Snowden to, I mean, I've got a copy of his email that he sent us when I first had this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| I guess, late Sunday. No, I have that. I have that. I just didn't know if there was any. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| just wondering if we want to read that into the record, you know, just for the benefit of, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| know, some of the neighbors and other folks who may be watching. That's kind of my intent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| that. What I can do is I'll go ahead and take that right now. If you guys don't mind, then I'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| back to Commissioner Smith. But, let's see, Mr. Snowden sent this out this afternoon just a hair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| before two o'clock. Commissioner, Chairman Nystrom has received several emails. To be clear, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| the Commissioner's got this email. I'm saying this more for the record and anybody else who might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| be tuning in. Chairman Nystrom has received several emails regarding the noted rezoning item and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| that I provide some background. In summary, this rezoning was approved by an 8-3 vote of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Planning Commission in February. It's not that long. An 8-3 vote of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| with a staff recommendation of five per acre. The developer has since submitted his concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2082)|

| 0:35:05| We reviewed the traffic, we reviewed the applicant's traffic impact letter and concur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2105)|

| 0:35:14| the proposed traffic. For example, Thompson School Road is a 20-feet major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2114)|

| 0:35:49| Carnes and Barker roads to access the Gibbs schools. We concur these roads are narrow and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| have sharp curves, which we believe will serve as a deterrent for through traffic as well as act as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| natural calming effect. In addition, the soon to be completed intersection improvements at Emery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2159)|

| 0:36:09| it's our professional opinion the traffic will follow the most convenient path and we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2169)|

| 0:36:34| read that into the record. Now that the chair recognized, now Commissioner Jay, you've still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| got the floor and Commissioner Smith, I noticed your light is no longer on. All right, go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2201)|

| 0:37:19| developed out to about 3.5. Okay, thanks for the clarification. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| All right, thank you. All right, Commissioner Jay, all right, you're done. All right, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| Beeler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have one question that I wanted to kind of begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| my comments with and this may be to Director Green. Mr. Chairman, you may know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| to this too. How many of the members of the Planning Commission are residents of the 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| This is Gerald Green. I don't believe that any of them, any of the current members are residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| of the 8th District. Okay, thank you, Director Green. You know, this is kind of unbelievable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2279)|
| 0:38:08| me. Now, I understand that the Planning Commission is not appointed by District, but it is appalling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| to me that there are zero members of the Planning Commission that reside in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| especially given the fact that the 8th District is approximately one-third of the land mass of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| Knox County and probably contains the majority of the remaining developable land in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I think this is a great injustice and I think it's something that needs to be remedied as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| I think this is a great injustice and I think it's something that needs to be remedied as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| as it possibly can. You know, having said that, if you will permit me to use an 8th District word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2321)|
| 0:38:51| this one's a booger. You know, I looked at my colleague, Commissioner Anders. I've watched him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2331)|
| 0:39:01| a lot, learned a lot from him, the way he's had to navigate all of these types of issues in Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| Valley. It seems like every time a development or rather a parcel is rezoned in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| Commission has to end up tweaking the density level of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| And I know this is not the last time this is going to happen in the 8th District. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| delicate triangle that has to be balanced in the 8th District. Commissioner Anders spoke to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| In the 8th District, there are really three things that most people desire. One is to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:40| our quality of life. Another is to not raise taxes. And the third one is to keep our way of life the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2380)|
| 0:39:49| same. Now, that might sound like a big oxymoron to a lot of people, but I get it. I understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2389)|
| 0:39:58| I understand it because I was born and raised in the 8th District. I live in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| I've always lived in the 8th District. I hope to die and be buried in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| So, I understand the way a lot of folks think out here. And here's part of what has to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| with that. You know, if we're not going to raise taxes, we've got to have economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| And part of having economic growth means we have to welcome a certain amount of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| with certain caveats, certain restrictions, meaning we don't want density. We don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| to be anti-development, but we don't want density. I say that to say I disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| the Planning Commission's zoning of five units per acre. I don't think it's appropriate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| the area. I don't think that we're ready for it, as Kevin alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| I don't think we're ready for that kind of density with our infrastructure. And I think a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| much larger conversation has got to happen, which that's my responsibility, but I've shared that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| with several people that have weighed in on this. Adam, Lisa Starbuck, Kevin. There's a much larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| conversation that's got to come out of this. You know, and as I've tried to navigate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| issue myself, knowing that I would probably be the one to look to for a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| my position on this has evolved from a month ago, to a week ago, to a day ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| to today, as I've processed through all the information. And I felt like I probably would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| leave this meeting not having made anybody happy. Because I think balance is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| Even though I disagree with five units per acre, and I don't like the fact we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| a representative on the Planning Commission, we do have a Planning Commission for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| And they have zoned not only this, but several parcels in the area at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2505)|
| 0:41:54| And there are even a couple of parcels zoned even more dense than that. And build out aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| the zoning, which is our responsibility, is at four units per acre in a number of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| As far as precedent goes, my hope is that the precedent this will set will go in the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| direction from five units per acre, and not be something that we necessarily have to replicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| but a direction that we want to set. I want to talk about, and I'm going to wrap this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| but I want to talk about just sheer numbers of units. Because that's really what's at issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| How many houses? As Adam said, we know development's coming. The question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| how many houses is it going to be? Well, based on the acreage, and based on what the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Commission approved, Mr. Davis could have put, if my math is correct, 215 houses on this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| Now, a lot of us out in the community would like to see that cut down to about 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| You know, that's 60 houses. That's a very significant reduction. I learned this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| afternoon when I got Mr. Snowden's email that the developer has actually voluntarily reduced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| by 30 houses. I think 31 was the exact calculation that I came up with. That's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| reduction too. And though it's not necessarily my preference, I think based on the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2598)|
| 0:43:29| most of the parcels around this one are zoned at four units per acre, and there are several units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| or rather parcels, in the area, especially on the other side of Emory Road, they're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| zoned at five units per acre. I think it's a reasonable concession. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| as much as I love my neighborhood and my neighbors, I don't want to send a message that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| we're developers willing to concede that we're not. You know, so the motion I'm going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| although I'll take heat from it, is to approve this at a density of 4.25 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| And I'll yield to a second if there is one. Okay, there's a motion on the floor from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| Commissioner Beeler. Is there a second? I'll make a second. Okay. That was a little quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2655)|
| 0:44:24| Brad. But there's a second from Commissioner Anders. So we have a motion from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Beeler and a second from Commissioner Anders to approve this. As I heard, I'm going to restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| I think you said 4.25. Is that correct, Commissioner Beeler? Yes. Not in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| Okay. Let me pull up my participant chart here. All right. I've got Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| and then Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Gill, you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| just like to hear from the opposition at 4.25 units per acre, please. Okay. Mr. Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2693)|
| 0:45:02| you're recognized via Commissioner Gill. Would it be possible for me to defer to Kevin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| Of course. Yeah. Kevin, Mr. Murphy. All right. Thank you. Quite honestly, I think the community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| position was this development is a little bit too soon. And this is one where when Mayor Jacobs was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| talking about growth plans a few months ago in some of the meetings, he stated that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| we'll actually have to find a development that's a little bit ahead of the infrastructure and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| build out. And we may need to pause that one. This is one where we really do want a small area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| plan and some action from commission to actually say, how are we going to implement building this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| community out some? So that was really where the community started. And going up to three and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| half units an acre is a compromise that, okay, we'll try and do more of the same. 4.25 is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| little bit more, and it sends a bit of a signal. You are talking about 30 houses, so the transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| numbers are kind of small, but there's a lot of developable land still out in that area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| if you add that on at increased density, that's where the impacts come. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| All right. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Commissioner Gill, did you have any follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| Okay. No. Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Looking at the growth plan, all of the growth plan land is a strip that runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| along the corridor between Gibbs and Halls. A majority of the land in the Corrington and Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| area is in the rural designation, which is going to be limited to two to three units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| if it is ever developed once the sewer system, if sewer comes along. We have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2805)|
| 0:46:55| very useful and rational and utilize what land we do have in the planned growth area. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| the Taylor proposal is a good idea. That community has received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| structure improvements and schools. I'm going to be able to support this, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2833)|
| 0:47:25| Okay. All right. Is there anybody looking for any other hands? I'll weigh on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and I'll tell you what has been my struggle bus on this one. As a commissioner, I'm on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| on multiple zonings saying I'm in favor of density adjacent to school areas. When you pull this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| frankly, on the Google Maps and you see how close you are to the school core right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:50| and that it's in the planned growth area, that's kind of a challenge I have on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| Then hearing also from the schools that they're not completely tapped out and that the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| suggests that the road is not as dangerous as I saw in some of the emails that I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| I probably would have preferred to see this at four than 4.2, but this is something I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| probably live with myself, but mainly just because I've been consistent in voting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| things when we have a density option that's really, really close. I can't quite say a stone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| throw, but it's really close to a school area, and that's where else would you have density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| and that's kind of where I've been, and I've been pretty consistent about that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| Commissioner Smith, your light is still on if you wanted to weigh in there. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| Commissioner Beeler, you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| and I meant to say this in my remarks, I would have preferred four as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| I agree with you on that, but I got my calculator out and the difference was nine houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| and I understand you've got to stop somewhere, but I just felt like it was a good faith gesture by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| developer to come from five down to 4.25, or whatever his number was, and I was willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| make that concession. Okay. All right. I'm looking, and to my fellow commissioners, I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| look over at the participant chart. I don't necessarily look at you if you raise your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| and I'm not seeing any other hands raised, at least on our digital. All right. Back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask Commissioner Beeler, what were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| of the community's concerns regarding the development in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| Commissioner, I think you've heard most of them. I think Mr. Thompson and Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| articulated them pretty well, but I think the biggest one was probably the roads and Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| School Road being the route that the county's looking at while residents might prefer to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| Carnes Road and Barker Road, which are much more narrow and maybe not as well equipped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| certainly not equipped to handle much traffic. I will say this. I mean, I could walk those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| blindfolded. I've lived here all my life, and they're right. Carnes Road is not a good road for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| commuting, and neither is Barker Road. However, I think the traffic signal at Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| the realignment of Fairview and Thompson School is going to make a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| in people's desire to take that route, and I think you will see more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| taking that route once that project is done, which should not be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| As a follow-up to that statement, Commissioner Beeler, and I'm looking to Jim Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| I guess that'd be community-based, but would a traffic calming thing for Carnes Road be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| appropriate if they want to reduce the traffic? I know you usually have to have a certain number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| of residents vote on that kind of stuff, but speed bumps or something. I mean, I know it's a tiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| road. It's a pig road or something I think I read, but would that be appropriate for such a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| road to increase the discouragement and to try to do a more aggressive job to direct the traffic to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| the other route? Mr. Snowden? Yes, Chairman. We can look at that. Typically, those roads that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3078)|
| 0:51:27| cut through and, you know, carry through traffic, we try to avoid traffic coming on just because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| the use of emergency vehicles, but that is something that we can certainly look at and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| consider should the problem present itself. Okay. Okay, I thought I saw another light come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3099)|

| 0:52:16| for it and a need for it. I think five is way too many. If you look back at the property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3136)|
| 0:52:25| we've used in the area that I represent, we may not have utilized it to its most usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| but it's been between the communities and the developers to reach a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| and they're right at about 4, 4.25, and it's a zoning. Has the plan been presented to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3160)|
| 0:52:50| Mr. Green? Has the plan been presented to you yet how the subdivision will be laid out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| Yes, sir. They have presented it, and as both Mr. Davis and Mr. Smith said, it's about 4.22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:53:07| units an acre, about 185 units in the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you. All right. Thank you. The chair, Mr. Thompson, would like to speak. Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| you. Oh, thank you. No, I just, as Mr. Beeler brought up earlier, a possible postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| because this may be completely different with the community in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| because obviously it is just me. It's a Zoom meeting, because there was strong opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| to this, and I think, you know, if it was set at 4, obviously the other properties have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3220)|
| 0:53:49| rezoned to that, but I think your all's opinions might be a little bit different if you could see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| just in person how much opposition there was to this. Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3237)|
| 0:54:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Thompson, his thoughts are the same as mine. I sent you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| email today along with the law department that anyone in opposition, we should defer until May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| so the opposition could come and we could see them face-to-face, but that's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| I like the 4 number along with all the others that's surrounding it. I feel comfortable at 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| but I'm not sure at 4.2 or 4.25, but, you know, I agree with Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| And I believe it should have been heard in front of the whole zoning board in the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:54| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Daley. Okay. We've got Commissioner Biggs and then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3294)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. Just a couple of things. Number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| are we sure we're meeting in May? I feel like given the circumstances, things change rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| Maybe we'll be back on Zoom and then you have to worry about vacations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| Will people be able to be in person to actually have some rebuttal? Also, I've driven this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| multiple times as well, and looking at it, they are correct. Carnes is a very narrow path. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3327)|
| 0:55:36| wouldn't really call it a road, but there are some great things that have been happening out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Gibbs Halls area in the 7th and 8th District. Also, there's some talks. We had a meeting. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| not, I think Mr. Thompson may have actually been there at Gibbs High School where we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| about putting in a bridge, an overhead bridge to accommodate the students from walking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| Gibbs Elementary over to Gibbs High, Gibbs Middle, and things like that. So, I don't want Mr. Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| or Mr. Murphy to feel like we're just going to approve this and there it is. Nothing's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| happen. As Richie Beeler, I would say, would say that I feel like Gibbs is kind of God's country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| It's beautiful out there, and I don't want anybody to think that we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| take this opportunity to take these zoning serious, just like we're doing in Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3378)|

| 0:56:40| you know, and coming to 4.25, I feel like is agreed upon, and that's why I'll be voting yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3400)|

| 0:56:54| Commissioner Kehl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, my concern is to make sure that the voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| of the public, and I know this pandemic is just an extraordinary set of circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3422)|

| 0:57:17| but I'm sure that the level of opposition from the community and their voices based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| opposition and information that was sent probably has not been captured to the extent, and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| want to say that part of this process, what is missing is the public, and we just need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| sure that we echo the sentiments of the public and the opposition that is present for this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3460)|

| 0:58:19| coming off it because he hadn't reached out to us. He hadn't talked to us any at all, so I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| what his reasoning was for dropping to the 4.22 on his own, but I know that there's a wetter part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3504)|
| 0:58:33| of this property that may not be able to be developed anyway, so I didn't know if Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| would get this rezoned to four to match the surrounding properties, that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| We'd greatly appreciate that. Thank you. I'll see if I've got any other lights on over this. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=3528)|

| 1:08:54| The current zoning and the current situation was done in the early 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4134)|

| 1:09:07| Okay. Very good. Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just had a couple of questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| because it's not in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| Director Green, what was the staff's reasons for denial of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| The request came for a rural residential, and that's not permitted in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| strangely enough, in the rural area. The low-density residential is, and the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4170)|

| 1:09:41| We're trying to recognize the development pattern and the current situation and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| to maneuver within the dictates of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| Okay, and there's no sewer in that area, and both of these lots are within less than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| How is it possible to deed property without platting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Again, as Ms. Lonemeyer stated, this is a condition from probably the 1960s, and I can't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| I can only speculate that the deed was accepted at one point without a review of any plat or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| any subdivision. It was just sold by deed or transferred by deed as opposed to any plat being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| surveyed for and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| I want to make sure we're not doing two things. One, this would not be considered a spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| and two, this is in the area outside the urban growth plan. Would this in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| set a precedent in that area and possibly bring in a development higher than it is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| being developed? We look at it as a possibility, but we don't have a plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4245)|

| 1:17:03| This property is part of the Gettysview development in the southwest county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| early 2000s. It was included as part of the golf course and the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| is open space. That was a mistake, and the sector plan was 2005, actually, and no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4637)|
| 1:17:25| realized it, apparently, until the owner asked about potential development of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| and it was discovered that it was designated as open space, and again, that was a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| in the sector plan in 2005. The zoning allows the development. It's planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| but the sector plan designation was incorrectly applied in 2005. The request before you is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| correct that mistake, and the Planning Commission recommended approval of the amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4670)|

| 1:18:13| Mr. Green. Once again, I'll ask in case someone has come in. Is there anyone in opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=4693)|

| 1:39:50| Um, the next item is number 52, but it was withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| That is correct, uh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| We voted on it, we confirmed a withdrawal when we set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Item number 53, ordinance O-20-4-101, is amended in Knox County Code, Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6007)|
| 1:40:16| Zoning, Article III, Section 3.50, Off-Street Parking Requirements, to allow a parking study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| to be submitted and approved as a basis for reducing the minimum number of off-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10th, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| We're good, I'll look to Commissioner Beeler to make a motion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| I'll make a motion that, uh, we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| I'll approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Okay, we have a motion from Commissioner Beeler with a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| Uh, Mr. Green, could you, uh, just, uh, I keep calling this one kind of the dollar general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| fix one, but if you wanted to, for the benefit of the public before we vote on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| could you, uh, kind of share a little bit on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| And if any of the other commissioners, I think Commissioner Beeler, you spoke about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| a little bit at the work session as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Uh, commissioners, this is brought before you based not only on the dollar general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| but on other, uh, developments which had to meet pretty, uh, demanding parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6073)|
| 1:41:23| under our ordinance, which was developed at a time when, uh, the, uh, parking standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| were much higher than, than, uh, we currently see in, in commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| The current standards require a great deal of land and cost for development and are unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| We find developments which have parking areas that are underused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| This ordinance would allow a parking study to be done to justify the reduction in parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6104)|
| 1:41:51| That parking study would be approved by Engineering and Public Works, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| development could proceed without going through the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| We feel this is a much better approach to the situation than going through the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| And the Planning Commission voted to 11 to 0 to recommend approval of the ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6126)|
| 1:42:19| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| Uh, excuse me, I'm seeing some folks to weigh in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Uh, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| I'm being distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Drusilla just sent me a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| All right, so Commissioner Schoonmaker and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| All right, Commissioner Schoonmaker, your light's now off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| All right, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| I just want to make sure we all understand this before we go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| As Director Green said, we had requirements that were requiring too much land to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| I want to just make sure we don't swing the pigeon on the other way too far, as government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| often does, and make sure that when we build these buildings in these parking lots that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| we realize that there may be a day in the future that there may be another use within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| And I just want to make sure we're not limiting future uses of these spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Is there any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Oh, my computer just froze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| Can y'all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| Why does he always look exactly the same when he freezes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6228)|
| 1:43:48| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| And just to respond to Commissioner Smith's comment, I think that's a very good comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| And in reviewing these parking studies, we'll look at not only the present use, but others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| within the range, commercial range for commercial buildings, and try to ensure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| addressing not only the current situation, but allowing free use of the property in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| I got knocked off the internet for a half second there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Mr. Green, I heard you weighing in on that, but I also know Commissioner Daley would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| to weigh in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| Yeah, I believe also that if someone else moves in, you have to have a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| which they could ask for more or less parking spaces at that time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| We also need to set a meeting, public meeting for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| For the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| We could do the vote, but then after the vote, we do need to set a public hearing for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| one, which I think we planned on having on the 18th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6294)|

| 1:45:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6330)|

| 1:46:26| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Since we are setting a meeting time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| God forbid we have to meet by Zoom again next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| but today we ran into pension board running into beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| If we do have to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| and I think we're going to try to get an audit committee meeting in next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| that we should be very attentive to how much longer these meetings take on Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| and set our schedules appropriately, our times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Historically, I think when we do these public hearings that we not usually do them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| public hearing like this could be something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| you know, our work session days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| I know that Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| I know we're working on trying to get a finance committee put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| I'm wondering if something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| knowing how these things tend to run late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| if a public hearing like this might be better on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| you know, basically on the 18th on a work session day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| but then you have it either before the work session possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| if we can get a transition out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| that meeting before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| if we have a finance committee meeting possibly before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| So, Commissioner Smith, back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| and then I've got a hand up, I think it must be Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| All right, Commission Office, hand us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Is that you, Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| Yes, I was just going to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| Jim Morrison has already scheduled May 18th for the audit committee at 3 to 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Yep, yep, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Okay, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Remember May, we move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| how are we doing with Memorial Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Move them up a week, our meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| No, it will be on the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| So, we're still going to be right there at the end of Phase 1 with the COVID-19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6509)|
| 1:48:36| Okay, I'll make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| we'll need to get this basically scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| and I'll make a determination probably if we're going to be Zooming or not Zooming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| you know, probably in the next week or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| but I'd almost say prepare for Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| but know that we might go live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| I'll take a look at the pre-opening guidelines and see kind of where we fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| But, you know, I guess we just really need to take a look at hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| at what is going to be the best dates for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| because we've got, we're looking at 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| the 18th and or the 26th are two busy days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| and we've already got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| it may be, you know, I want to make sure the public can get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| and if we try to do this before the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| that would be really awkward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| but we've never done a meeting like this before the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| I think you scheduled the Audit Committee meeting for a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| True, when's Jim got that Audit Committee meeting set down for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| Did he put it on the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| I'm sorry, it's a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Yeah, yeah, the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| It's a Monday, the 18th, from 3 to 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6576)|
| 1:49:43| That could be a catch-up meeting, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| because I think the last Audit meeting was canceled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| so it will probably go right up to almost 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Maybe not, but it might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| And Commissioner Jay, we have a Rules Committee meeting on the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| so who's on the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| So you've got Rules Committee and Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| so we may have to change the Rules Committee, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| Yeah, we'll reschedule that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I'll make a note of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| Mr. Chairman, if we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| why don't we roll this public hearing to June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| Well, is that going to impede the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| I might look to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| I'll try to work with the folks who proposed it, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| and see if we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| but it's going to be awkward, as heck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| to get it crammed in on the 18th and over the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| But I also don't want to kind of block them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| because they've been working on trying to get this done for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| and we've already had to postpone it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| I'd rather, at the risk of having another late night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| try to do the public hearing on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| still in conjunction with one of our existing meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| Probably, we could do it at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6663)|
| 1:51:03| It is possible for a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| if we want to have a little control on getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| Work sessions are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| We can close our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| go into a public hearing at 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| see if anybody shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| and then come back to our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| That might be the best option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| just to get this done and not go too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| That kind of passes the red face test to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| Anybody have a better idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| I'm going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| I'm seeing John, Drew, and Randy's lights are lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| So, John, you're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6695)|
| 1:51:35| Yeah, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| Drusilla?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| I was just going to recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| after the work session on the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| probably your better day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Drew's recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| I just don't know how deep our agenda is going to be in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| if it's going to be a really late night or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Commissioner Smith, then Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| Yes, we very seldom have very long meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| for these hearings, public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| They usually last five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| I think your idea of 6 o'clock on the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| recess the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| and go to that meeting would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| I think that's also fair for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Back to you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Yeah, I agree with the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| And also, I think we have to have a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| before we can even vote on it for final passages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| So, we couldn't do it on the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| Or we could, but we'd have to do it before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| And that could be a block with the Pension Committee before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| So, Drusilla, can you post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| we'll have it start at 6 o'clock and on the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| just to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| because things are tending to run later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| as we're doing these Zoom and roll call votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| We'll have it start at 6 o'clock on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| Wherever we are in the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| we can go into recess, have the public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| and then come back to the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| Okay, I'll make a note of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| That seems fair for the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| and for the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| Commissioner Daley, your light's still on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| as yours is, Commissioner Smith, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| All right, back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6801)|
| 1:53:21| I'm really bad about hitting that button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Okay, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| has that got us through all of our business for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| Yes, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| All right, any other final announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| or anything like that before we adjourn the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Motion to adjourn, accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200428-zoning?start=6822)|
