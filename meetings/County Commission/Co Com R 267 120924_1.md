| 2:23:41| I've read with the mayor where his opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| I've talked to him probably every other day in the last eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| He hasn't given me anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| He was not shy about telling me where he was three months ago when we had a school tax looming at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| He was obviously against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| And I've talked to Dean Rice, and he hasn't said, hey, I hope you'll do this or that on the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| I haven't heard anything from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| And I personally don't think Chris is making an end run on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| I'm just ---- I respect Chris, and I think he's shooting us straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8651)|
| 2:24:17| And I just have a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| Sometimes I agree with Joe Jarrett and sometimes I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| Sometimes I agreed with Bill Lockett and sometimes I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| But I always followed their advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| And I usually said I don't ---- I'm not an attorney, so I'm not giving you advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| But I want to help the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| I agree with Mike, Larry, and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| But I want to ---- I can only do it under the stipulations that the law director has laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8680)|
| 2:24:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| Mr. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| Yeah, pardon my absence, and thank you for allowing me back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| The issue I have with this is not that I don't think that seniors deserve to be taken to their doctor's appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8695)|
| 2:25:05| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| I just believe that some of the vans that if you explored the ---- I mean, the price per trip is something that I find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8706)|
| 2:25:16| I think it's a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| And I think that some of the vans that take some of the kids to school from doorstep to the school could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| maybe offer a lower cost opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| And, you know, some of the taxi companies may want to be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| I mean, I think it ---- the barbers have a great compassion for seniors, and they do a great job at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| But I don't know that we can't do it cheaper as another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| And so that's the reason that I think that ---- I just don't think it's efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| I don't think the logistics, you know, in my district I see an ETHRA van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| I see a CAC van crossing paths on a consistent basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| And, you know, maybe in the logistics study and some of these transportation companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| there's smaller transportation companies that have been taking students to and from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| and in their down time could participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| And so that's kind of maybe the other entity that you brought forward at the budget time to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8768)|
| 2:26:15| I mean, maybe they could participate at a cheaper rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| The nonprofit that came, the assisted ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| wasn't there a senior assistance program that's the same program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| Well, you know, there's other entities that can participate that I think may be able to do it a little bit cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| and more bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| And so that's the only comment I've had about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| Go ahead, Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| So if we offer a substitute resolution then that we go ahead and appropriate the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| and bid it out or not so much bid it out, I guess, as an RFI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| and you're going to tell me, Hugh, that you're going to have this wrapped up in four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| And on next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| Typically, it's 21 business days, and I said four to six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| And then, of course, we'll try to get a placeholder on the commission's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| so we can, if evaluation takes longer than a week, that it will already be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| I can't imagine you're going to have a whole lot of companies bidding on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| Like Mike said, they're pretty much the only game in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| You never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| That's why we compete, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| Well, then let's do the substitute motion then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| and that way I think everyone's heartburn will be laid to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| I also want to point out that if we start this immediately, as I had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| this is not going to bump up the cost per trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| The cost per trip would stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| It would just bump up the number of trips then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8866)|
| 2:27:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| I'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| Will you restate your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| It's that we appropriate the $500,000, exactly what we said it was for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8875)|
| 2:28:03| and that Hugh is going to put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| Now, do you want a request for information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| An RFI for a defined services contract for this specific thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| and that this should be back hopefully by next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| And the second concurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| Mr. Anderson, I guess for Hugh, if we designate the money and send out an RFI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| if we're still not satisfied that we're ñis this the final vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| If we designate this money, is it a done deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| Well, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| Besides contract approval, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Besides contract approval, I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| Substitute motion has been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| Raise your hand for opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| We've got two, Smith and Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8947)|
| 2:29:14| Substitute motion prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Okay, Dean, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| I just wanted some clarification on the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| I wanted to wait until after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| At the beginning, Commissioner Boyles, you removed the disability clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| and opened it up to seniors in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Now, how will that play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| I think everybody wants a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| I'll talk to you during the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| And I've got it written out right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| Because that is not consistent with CAC's mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8981)|
| 2:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| We'll come back and continue to review that too when we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| Let's take ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| I would like to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| That discussion got really protracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| And I'd just like to remind the commissioners that technically you have the right to two entries into the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9004)|
| 2:30:16| And we had several people have multiple, multiple entries there into the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| And that's the chair's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| Nobody was out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| I mean, out of order in the sense of propriety or civility or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9027)|
| 2:30:33| But I think for in the sake of saving time, it would be wise for us to try to hold to that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9033)|
| 2:30:42| Two items, you're going to be into the debate twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| Make that, hold that second one and make it good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| And you can wait before turning the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9050)|
| 2:30:55| You can wait until obviously we're getting towards the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| So that will help promote, expedite the debate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9059)|
| 2:31:06| But they can't be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9066)|
| 2:31:07| They've got to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Well, you're adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| We're trying not to repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| We're trying not to repeat, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| On page 12, resolution 908, is designating, committing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| and appropriating funds in the amount of $300,000 from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| to provide for the location selection site development and design of the senior center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| in the northwest section of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| Motion to approve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| We've got a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| I was just asking this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| Does this need to be put out for bid or any portion of it need to be put out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| I mean, we're talking about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| We just said that we had to bid this other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Does this need to be put out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| And if so, what portion of it and how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| I assume that's to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| Well, either that or Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| These are the design services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| Those are professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| and we have the option to contract directly with a particular architect engineering firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9140)|
| 2:32:28| or we could do a request for qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| and hire a firm based on those submittals of qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| In the state of Tennessee, you can't hire an architect based on price, qualifications only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9157)|
| 2:32:47| Well, I would be interested in doing something on qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Otherwise, the way it would work is your office would determine who would get the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| Nothing against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| I'm just saying that I think that you're talking about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| I think it would be prudent for us to do this request for qualifications so that we can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| That's what I would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| I'm in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| I would just like for us to see us do it that way, if that's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| And it sounds like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| Yes, we've done that several times recently for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9196)|
| 2:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Mr. Hammond, would you like to add that as an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| I'd like to add it as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| Is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| So, and to the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Mike was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| I spoke to one other thing that I think this particular proposal resides in the same area that, speaking of budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9225)|
| 2:33:57| and other discussion, I'll renew my so you'll know why my vote is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9237)|
| 2:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| Along the lines of Mr. Hammond's question, the $300,000 was a figure we used to allow for appraisals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9251)|
| 2:34:19| and environmental studies and things like that for you as office to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| Whatever is not used will go, if we choose to move forward with it, it will go into the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| So it's more along the lines of getting the project ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| and hopefully next year with the capital we can get it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9280)|
| 2:34:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| Brad, I think it is sorely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| I think it would be a great site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| I think it would be a very, very heavily used senior citizen site that's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| But my only concern, I'm with Dave on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| You know, guys and ladies, let's just do it during budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| Let's do it during the budget time and let's put it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| And, you know, I just remember us knocking on doors and what people told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9309)|
| 2:35:16| hold on to the money, hold on to the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| And that's what I'm looking at and how I'm voting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9319)|
| 2:35:25| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| The light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| Remind you of what we said earlier, that we were told that let's look, let's get this budget passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9331)|
| 2:35:41| let's look and see what excess we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| Then we can determine what we need to spend it on, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| Everything that we've done so far is going back to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9350)|
| 2:35:57| Just to remind you of that, we were told, wait until the budget was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| wait until we got to year-end figures, and then we can see what's left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| and what we can work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Don't forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| I'd like to speak last if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| I think you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| I think you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| You know, really just in what Larry said, Commissioner Smith said, you know, in 2008 when I got elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9380)|
| 2:36:27| I asked then Mayor Mike Ragsdale to include it in the next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| In 2009, I asked Mayor Ragsdale to include it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| And I think Dean can attest, in 2010 and 2011 and 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| I've asked for it to be added into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| But out of respect for being physically conservative in our spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9403)|
| 2:36:51| I just asked it to be in there and not pushed it as a commissioner because it wasn't the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| But now, you know, the excuse has always been we don't have the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| The money has become available through this last budget, and I'd like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| And so I respect what Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| but I've asked for four years in the budget meetings with the mayor prior to its implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| I think in my first budget I tried to get it in there, and it was voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| And so the discussion never made it to the table, one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| But, you know, I have come respectfully of the budget time and done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| And so that's just kind of the history on this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| Seeing no further lights on, let's entertain the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| The motion is to approve with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9459)|
| 2:37:45| And the amendment was a request for qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| Let's start in the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9475)|
| 2:37:58| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| I wasn't used to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9485)|

| 2:38:43| Pass with your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9523)|

| 2:38:48| Seven, two, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9531)|
| 2:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| Page 13, Resolution 909, Designated Committing and Appropriating Funds in the amount of $55,000 for fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013 for the purpose of providing $5,000 in discretionary funding for each of the 11 Knox County Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9543)|
| 2:39:23| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Mr. Law Director, if we approve these discretionary funds for the individual commissioners, are we going to have to publicize this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9571)|
| 2:39:40| Do we have to take out ads as we've done before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| Yeah, that's why I'm – thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| That was my initial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| That's a very good question, and I know that when you were chair, we hashed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9589)|
| 2:39:56| And I think the law department has done an excellent job of kind of getting us back on what I think is some fairly sure and stable footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9596)|
| 2:40:07| And the answer is it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9607)|
| 2:40:10| You know, it depends on where we're going to give the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| If you look at that resolution, if it's called a civic organization, then those will have to go in the newspaper general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9614)|
| 2:40:26| But if it's any other kind of nonprofit charitable, and then I'll defer to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9626)|
| 2:40:33| I don't want to play that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| But I do think a lot of what we've done in the past will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| And then we'll almost say bypass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| That would not be a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| But I'll look to the law director to amplify my ramblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| Commissioner Hammond, we did some in-depth research on the question brought to us by Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9651)|
| 2:40:59| And the way the state law actually reads and the attorney general, we have an attorney general's opinion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| and they classified charitable organizations for our purposes here into two major categories, one civic organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| one charitable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| If it's a civic organization and they've defined that by statute, then it has to have notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| If it's a charitable organization, meaning no individual profits from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| it doesn't have to be a charitable classification, you know, like 501C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9684)|
| 2:41:30| I mean, if it's a community organization and it's charitable with no one profiting from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| and it's for the goodwill and benefit of the community, it does not have to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9695)|
| 2:41:41| My recommendation to you, and we've actually amended your application form where they can check some boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9701)|
| 2:41:48| and it will give you a definition of what you have coming to you, meaning yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| or the combination thereof, it's pretty self-explanatory once you read the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9714)|
| 2:42:01| whether you need to give notice to this particular person you want to award or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| So my recommendation is also after that, you can always give notice after the fact on charitable organizations if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9726)|
| 2:42:16| but it is not required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| Okay, does that muddy it up for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| So I know that we got into a situation like with Mr. Arnett's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9741)|
| 2:42:28| that because we were having to take out these ads so frequently, we had to amend our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9748)|
| 2:42:33| to have budget monies available to put toward this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| And it just got to the point where it was, you know, if you're going to give somebody $250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| you had to pay $100 to put it in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| So under what scenario do you see that we would have to take out an ad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| You said if we did an organization where no one profited, if it was for the community good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| that was probably going to be about 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| And so how do you foresee where we would have to take out an ad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9776)|
| 2:43:01| I'm trying to envision something because if it's a Little League softball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| and you're trying to help them buy uniforms, that wouldn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| That wouldn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| So I guess I'm trying to think this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| There could be some organizations that are actually non-taxable organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| where individuals personally may benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| I'm trying to think of one right off the top of my head that might do that, that would be coming to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9803)|
| 2:43:29| I doubt very rarely if one would be coming to you all when we're talking about, well, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9809)|
| 2:43:36| if we're going to school stuff like, you know, I always did, it's like almost a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| So you don't have to notice that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| If you're talking about boys and girls clubs and baseball teams and stuff like that, if it's, you know, a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9824)|
| 2:43:55| I can't think of a civic organization, maybe somewhere where people get paid to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9835)|
| 2:44:02| A lot of times they'll be in a non-profit situation where we pay people to do certain things for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| where individuals benefit from the donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| In other words, is there a salary line item in that donation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| The chamber, for example, certain people would benefit from a donation if we charged back salaries for a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9857)|
| 2:44:25| or whatever it is you're donating for the money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| But in your actual application, you know, you're going to be able to say, I'm going to buy a baseball bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9869)|
| 2:44:35| It's going to be for XYZ baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| And they're going to check nobody profits and it's for the community good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| And you're good to go, you know, 50, I don't know what baseball bats cost, maybe $500 today, those aluminum ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| But, you know, then you'll be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| But if they check the box and they're swearing to this in their affidavits to you in their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9892)|
| 2:44:59| we're using the same forms we used to use, but we've added in two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9899)|
| 2:45:05| So you'll be able to see and they will define that in their own affidavit to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| If the answer is individuals profit, then you'll have to notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| We put an amendment to this resolution that says if an individual is profiting, that the money cannot be used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9916)|
| 2:45:23| It can only be used for what you have determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| If you would be interested in doing that, I would be very interested in supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| That way there's no question that this money is not going to go toward anything that's not a nonprofit or charitable use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9930)|
| 2:45:37| So let me say I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9937)|
| 2:45:43| I was trying to figure out how to codify that because we have two resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9943)|
| 2:45:48| You've got 9-11, which is where that statement lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| You know, nothing in this resolution says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| And 9-09 says civic charitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| So I don't know how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| I do want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| That's my overarching goal is for us not to give to those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| So maybe we have to put it in both of these amendments, just an abundance of caution to make sure that it's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| But I am willing to accept that in whatever form the law department deems necessary to ensure that we don't fall into that trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9975)|
| 2:46:26| We can eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| By definition, we had worked on a proposal for a resolution to amend your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9987)|
| 2:46:34| And in there we defined a civic organization by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| It is only 501C4 classifications that fall into civic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=9997)|
| 2:46:44| So if there are 501C4, then you would have to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10004)|
| 2:46:51| Any other charitable organization other than a chamber would fall into the category of a charitable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10011)|
| 2:47:00| And that means nobody profits, and it's for the community goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10020)|
| 2:47:06| And so that's straight out of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| We defined it according to the attorney general's opinion and definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| But if you wanted to just say only charitable organizations, which are non-profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10032)|
| 2:47:18| which no part of the net earning in years or made lawfully in years to the benefit of any private shareholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10038)|
| 2:47:25| or individual and that it provides services benefiting the general welfare of the residencies of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10045)|
| 2:47:32| that definition is non-noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| So if you just wanted to limit your resolution to that definition, I don't see why you couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10056)|
| 2:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| I want to get us all wrapped up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| So that sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| But we hadn't done 9-11 yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| So can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| You know, because what the law director called out is Section 3, Part A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10073)|
| 2:48:00| So can I call that out in 909?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| I guess we can just pull those words out and add those in the resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10083)|
| 2:48:09| And we just add both of them in both of them, 909 and 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10092)|
| 2:48:13| Is that okay with you, Commissioner Hamm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| Why don't you add them together and make it one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| Combine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| Well, the only reason is this policy might be taken, you know, as a standalone document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10099)|
| 2:48:29| You know, this kind of defines what entities we fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10109)|
| 2:48:34| And I just didn't want it to get tied into this one-year designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10114)|
| 2:48:40| So that's a good question, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| But that's why I didn't want to marry the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10122)|
| 2:48:46| This resolution that we're discussing now is just for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Mr. Brown, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| If we do, as the law director has just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| and with the amendment that was just made to where it would be strictly non-profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| those that gain would not be eligible, do we still have to do Number 6 and 7 on your form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10149)|
| 2:49:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| If you amended what you're voting on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| we would have to amend the policy to be in alignment with what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| This was prepared, this resolution, yeah, it was prepared for what the original motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10167)|
| 2:49:34| If you amend the motion, we'll have to amend this resolution to align with that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| But 6 and 7 could come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10182)|
| 2:49:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10186)|
| 2:49:47| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10187)|
| 2:49:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| Commissioners, if we pass this today, that gives us $951,000 that we have spent for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10191)|
| 2:50:00| Our parents are on vacation, and we just found the checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| And that's what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| We're spending money as fast as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| I'm against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| If we want to put money, if you want to give money back to the community, just give your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10213)|
| 2:50:19| It's nothing but for politics to have your picture in the paper, giving away taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10219)|
| 2:50:25| Take umbrage with that remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10229)|
| 2:50:30| Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10230)|
| 2:50:34| I think Mr. Smith was out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| No, we all give money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| We give a lot of money to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10238)|
| 2:50:42| And if you want to give money, you know, I have to tell people no everyday too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10242)|
| 2:50:47| I get hit by every, the high schools in my district, the middle schools in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| the elementary schools in my district, not counting the non-profits in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10252)|
| 2:50:58| We've all got X number of dollars to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10258)|
| 2:51:04| I just think that we're spending money right and left, and I just, I do not think that's what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10264)|
| 2:51:11| that's not what I signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| I didn't sign up to spend it as quick as it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| We still have debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| We still have debt that we need to pay down, and we keep forgetting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10277)|
| 2:51:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10284)|
| 2:51:25| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10286)|
| 2:51:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| I renew what I've said before about the time and place of discussion we're taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10294)|
| 2:51:39| This is not about the merits of discretionary funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10299)|
| 2:51:45| This is about the budget cycle and about budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10305)|
| 2:51:51| And having said that, and I'll digress for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| A couple of years ago, I did not defend discretionary funding because it took too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10316)|
| 2:52:06| It took too much money, as we've noted, to get it put in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10326)|
| 2:52:14| But even if we, on our own, relax that requirement, I still do not like the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10334)|
| 2:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| We're getting a little frisky on this one, so let's keep making the comments impersonal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10344)|
| 2:52:31| and direct them through the chair, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10351)|
| 2:52:34| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| Well, this is not directed at the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| It's directed to Mr. Smith's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| Well, that's not appropriate, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| Mr. Brown, you direct your comments to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| I'll direct them to you then, and then you can tell him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| He does not speak for me when I sit in this chair and whoever I give money to in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10368)|
| 2:52:53| I don't give it to get reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| I give it because I want to and because those people need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| He may do that, but I don't do it, and I resent him telling that over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10380)|
| 2:53:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| Commissioner Brown and I are just in lockstep today in agreement, and that's all I'll say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10389)|
| 2:53:19| But to address Commissioner Wright's point, because it is a valid point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| it's a valid point, but let's hit rewind and go back to the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10405)|
| 2:53:33| These questions were asked, and they were good questions then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10413)|
| 2:53:38| We got a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| To be quite honest, I don't think we got as much research done in formalizing this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10420)|
| 2:53:46| So we asked the question, and I remember Commissioner Anders struggling with the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| we're paying this money, we're paying, you know, it's very diminishing returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10433)|
| 2:54:00| And so that's how we left it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| So this is a fresh question in my mind because we now have something that's been vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10444)|
| 2:54:15| vetted through the state, vetted through our local departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| and we have an answer that is amenable to what we were trying to do initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10460)|
| 2:54:26| So in this instance, I'm going to do a pullout on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| This resolution or this group of resolutions, in my opinion, don't fall in that same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10469)|
| 2:54:36| we should have talked about it during the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| And while we may disagree on even that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| but this particular question was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| It did go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10485)|
| 2:54:46| In fact, we've talked about it twice over the last couple of years, at least twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| And it just really came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| And I don't think anyone supported spending a whole lot of money advertising these few dollars that we were giving out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10492)|
| 2:54:59| So I do appreciate all of the conversations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10499)|
| 2:55:05| And I know we all give monies to our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10505)|
| 2:55:12| We all are extremely proud of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| And we spend a lot of, you know, time, talent, and resources within those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10517)|
| 2:55:24| And so that's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| That will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| And I will continue to write checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| Commissioner Brown will continue to write checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| Commissioner Smith will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| I don't know whether he accepts the funds or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| But to say that, to lock this in with $900,000, I think, you know, each measure has to be weighted on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10536)|
| 2:55:49| And, again, we talked a lot about RFIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| And for Hugh Holt, it's an everyday thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| And he's good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| He's good at this evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| He's probably right at RFQ and RFI, you know, blindfolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10560)|
| 2:56:05| But these other organizations and entities whose primary point and purpose are in their voluntary nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10565)|
| 2:56:11| they're out of love of community, love of the region or whatever, that's not their forte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10571)|
| 2:56:19| So for us to be able to transition just a little teeny tiny piece and help that organization out, I think is tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10579)|
| 2:56:28| So thank you all for this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| Commissioner Brown, I was going to ask you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| You're on the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| When you were asking me about the questions, I was thinking of two different questions when you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| would you say six or seven or seven or eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| Six and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10607)|
| 2:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| Well, actually an eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| I was thinking seven and eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| You know, if they had a detailed receipt of what they spent the money on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| there should be some kind of trail that they spent their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| Garden Club with a little league team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| I better turn the button on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| He asked you a question directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| You can go ahead and talk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| I mean, just, you know, if you're giving them something for a bat and they buy a bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| I mean, just to account for the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| But whether they have this board organization number eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| I don't know that it's going to be that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| They're not going to have a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| And whether they have an annual report or reporting just receipts, not all receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10645)|
| 2:57:30| but just what they spent the money on would be my recommendation to amend when we get to Resolution 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10650)|
| 2:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| I just wanted to clarify that since I answered you kind of in the blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10666)|
| 2:57:47| Mr. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10669)|
| 2:57:52| I wasn't in favor of this a year and a half ago, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10672)|
| 2:57:57| and I voted against it because I don't feel that the taxpayers want us using discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10677)|
| 2:58:05| And I will vote against it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| That's the reason I pulled mine for the wrestling team to get the wrestling mat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| I will continue to go out there and knock on businesses' doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| and do what I can to support what most would consider a pet project for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10696)|
| 2:58:25| But I'm not condemning anybody that are saying that people give to getting a paper or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10705)|
| 2:58:33| I mean, I don't think that's anybody's objective up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| But I just don't think it's a sound use of taxpayer money from the phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10717)|
| 2:58:43| and e-mails that I've received telling me that they don't want us spending this extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| They do not want us going and spending, you know, because we have extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10727)|
| 2:58:53| If we have extra money, it's because we took too much from the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| and we operated our government soundly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| And it's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| It's just go out and totally spend at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| But I will be not supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10748)|
| 2:59:12| And if it passes, I won't use any of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| We have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| and we had amended it or added to it a definition from the law director about what is acceptable from nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10760)|
| 2:59:31| So, the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| Let's roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10773)|
| 2:59:36| And let's start in the first this time, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10783)|
| 2:59:44| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=10784)|

| 3:05:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| Mr. Brown, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11138)|

| 3:05:40| Would you come forward, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11140)|
| 3:05:46| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| I know there's a whole bunch of them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| Is there anything that you would consider radical changes in any of these, or most of them just housekeeping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11150)|
| 3:05:57| Roy Braden, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| We're adopting all these codes because of state law and ISO ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11161)|
| 3:06:07| I don't think there's anything major here that is going to knock anybody's socks off between state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11167)|
| 3:06:14| changing things that would apply, which would be sprinklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| And then we've got a lot of these codes are options, optional for contractors and designers that the Green Construction Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11178)|
| 3:06:28| it's an optional thing, the Swimming Pool and Spa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| It allows the builders and designers more opportunities to design in a way that they can save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11192)|
| 3:06:41| I just want to get that on record for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| Thank you, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11203)|
| 3:06:44| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| Don't go too far, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| A couple of years ago I brought forth a swimming pool ordinance about the covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11209)|
| 3:06:56| I thought that meant this international swimming pool and spa code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11216)|
| 3:07:01| And you may not know the answer now, but on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11221)|
| 3:07:05| could you get me an answer if this allows for pool covers as a measure in lieu of fencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11225)|
| 3:07:14| It does allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| I'm not sure about your ordinance, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| I'd have to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11238)|
| 3:07:19| Oh, there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11239)|
| 3:07:20| Okay, yeah, could you look into that and see if it conflicts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11243)|
| 3:07:24| Well, my ordinance did not pass, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| So that was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| Is there anything there that maybe codifies that international code that allows that from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11250)|
| 3:07:37| It does allow in the code, it does allow the covers to be in lieu of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11257)|
| 3:07:43| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| But we did not repeal the swimming pool ordinance from 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| So if we wanted to do that, we would have to repeal that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11269)|
| 3:07:55| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| This doesn't supersede that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| That's correct, and I think that might be a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11277)|
| 3:08:02| And I think Daniel Sanders was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| He might be able to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| He's behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11286)|
| 3:08:16| Daniel Sanders, Knox County Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| From what I remember, your ordinance amendment that was retractable swimming pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11299)|
| 3:08:24| or retractable swimming pool covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| And the new ordinance will allow retractable swimming pool covers to meet certain specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11307)|
| 3:08:35| Right, but it doesn't repeal the swimming pool ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| Correct, and we did not repeal the Article 3 in that chapter of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11318)|
| 3:08:44| due to some grandfathering provisions that we wanted to retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| So that was the main purpose of retaining the third part of that chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11327)|
| 3:08:53| So I guess, yeah, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| We don't want to mess up anyone that has an existing pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| But going forward with that, okay, new home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| would I be able to build a swimming pool to these international standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| or would I still have to deal with that 1991 ordinance as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| No, when you pass this new revision, you'll be able to build the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| Pursuant to the newly adopted standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11362)|
| 3:09:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, except Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| There's always an except.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| Yeah, residential pools are going to sneak out on a lot of the stuff that's in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| because I asked a question last week about I saw something about 400 foot of fire hose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11375)|
| 3:09:45| Well, I went back and looked, and it may be like 500 foot of fire hose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11385)|
| 3:09:49| Or maybe I ask about 500 and it's really 400, but it doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| It's new construction and then still residential stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| The international code allows a lot of things to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| but then a lot of things fall through the cracks because it's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11403)|
| 3:10:09| Now, there may be stricter stuff at commercial or public use facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11409)|
| 3:10:16| You saw what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| I'm not an expert on it anyway because I'm going to ask a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11417)|
| 3:10:24| Having read a considerable amount of this, the statement sort of looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11424)|
| 3:10:31| and we've had Daniel Sanders speak to it, Knox County's vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11431)|
| 3:10:37| Did you say there were other, were there public meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11437)|
| 3:10:41| Which other organizations have looked at this and said they don't see anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11441)|
| 3:10:46| I want to get on record here saying I don't really see anything that looks bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| but I don't want anyone coming back in five months saying you shot us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11450)|
| 3:10:55| and then it's the same organization that's supposed to have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| There's a lot of meetings that I've been to with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11459)|
| 3:11:05| The city has, they're moving forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11465)|
| 3:11:09| They should be coming up for reading soon, maybe next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| East Tennessee Building Officials Association, we've met with Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11476)|
| 3:11:25| the ISO office that's pretty much dictating if we don't adopt these new codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11485)|
| 3:11:30| our insurance rating goes from a 3, which 1 is the best, 10 is the worst, from a 3.4 to a 9.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11490)|
| 3:11:37| You said ISO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11497)|
| 3:11:38| Which is the insurance service office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| Which specification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| A 3.4 is a really good score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11508)|
| 3:11:50| I mean, 1 would be the best, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| ISO 9000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| I'm not sure about, I just know ISO is the insurance service office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11515)|
| 3:12:00| and they rate fire departments and they rate building departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| So that's dictating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| The state of Tennessee has a law that requires us to adopt codes every seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11525)|
| 3:12:11| We're adopting these codes now because they've been out for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| We could possibly wait a short period of time, months, into next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11535)|
| 3:12:21| and then I think we would be in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| That's up for interpretation by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| But we've met with all the home builders numerous times, the ABC and AGC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11546)|
| 3:12:33| which represents general contractors on the commercial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| We've met with the city of Knoxville public works director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| and the building official there, and everybody understands there's going to be change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11563)|
| 3:12:49| I don't think there's major changes here, and we've actually amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| The home builders was concerned because there was a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| We amended the changes to adopt the 2009 energy requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11577)|
| 3:13:06| which is what the state's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11586)|
| 3:13:08| We agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11588)|
| 3:13:09| So there was about 12 or 13 amendments that reduced some values there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| but we're still meeting the state of Tennessee's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| Do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11607)|
| 3:13:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11608)|
| 3:13:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11610)|
| 3:13:31| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11611)|
| 3:13:32| We're past five o'clock now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| Let's move into zonings, and then we'll resume our agenda after zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11613)|
| 3:13:41| Do we need five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11621)|
| 3:13:42| Need five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11622)|
| 3:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11624)|
| 3:13:45| Let's take five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=11627)|

| 3:20:24| Go right ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12024)|
| 3:20:25| I have talked to Ms. Ferguson, and she is agreeable to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12025)|
| 3:20:30| They have also got, I don't know, a whole stack full of signatures from all the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12030)|
| 3:20:35| that everybody's in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| So there's absolutely no problem with this, and I'd appreciate you all considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12037)|

| 3:21:04| 8-H-12-RC is a request of Sam Connor for rezoning from A Agricultural to F Floodway to P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12064)|
| 3:21:14| Plain Commercial and F Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12074)|
| 3:21:16| Property located southeast side of West Emery Road southwest of Central Avenue Park in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12076)|
| 3:21:22| 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12082)|
| 3:21:25| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12085)|
| 3:21:30| Do you want to speak, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| Yes, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12092)|
| 3:21:33| Mr. Connor's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| This is property that is to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12095)|
| 3:21:39| On order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12100)|
| 3:21:41| We don't have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| Yeah, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12102)|
| 3:21:43| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12103)|
| 3:21:44| I have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12104)|
| 3:21:45| Do we ask are they here first or do we enter the motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| I'm trying to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| I guess we should ask if they're here first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| Otherwise, we won't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| So they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12116)|
| 3:21:57| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue and Sam Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12118)|
| 3:22:04| I'd like to make a motion to approve just to get the discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12124)|
| 3:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12128)|
| 3:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12129)|
| 3:22:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12130)|
| 3:22:11| Go ahead now, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| This is property that is to the west of Central Avenue Pike, south of Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12134)|
| 3:22:23| It is in the area to the west of I-75, Emory Road generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12143)|
| 3:22:30| This is property that was considered in connection with the North County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12150)|
| 3:22:38| which was approved by this body two months ago and approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12158)|
| 3:22:45| Apparently, some of the property in the North County Sector Plan is in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12165)|
| 3:22:51| and recommended for mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12171)|
| 3:22:54| Mr. Connor has filed a rezoning request for planned commercial zoning for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12174)|
| 3:23:02| which basically allows office commercial mixed uses of that nature and some uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12182)|
| 3:23:11| It was reviewed by the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| As a matter of fact, the planned commercial request was made in consultation with MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12194)|
| 3:23:21| MPC staff recommended it with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12201)|
| 3:23:26| The south part of the property is bounded by Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12206)|
| 3:23:31| and one of the conditions obviously is that there will be no building in that part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12211)|
| 3:23:37| that there be a dedication to the greenway, a 20-foot strip, to be designated by the Greenways Coalition through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12217)|
| 3:23:53| which Mr. Connor is fine with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| and that there be no building disturbance in the Beaver Creek flood plain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12235)|
| 3:24:03| without approval of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12243)|
| 3:24:08| So we are agreeable with all those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12248)|
| 3:24:10| He has met with his neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| One made a comment, which is in the MPC file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12253)|
| 3:24:18| that the zoning be planned commercial rather than an unplanned zone, which is fine with Mr. Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12258)|
| 3:24:26| Do you want to add anything to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12266)|
| 3:24:30| And we have met with people in connection with the planning process for the north county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12270)|
| 3:24:38| and several of the people we talked to there were fine with this change in the sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12278)|
| 3:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| Anyone else to speak in behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12291)|
| 3:24:55| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12295)|
| 3:24:56| Do we have anybody here in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12296)|
| 3:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| A motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| Oh, Mr. Brown, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12305)|
| 3:25:08| Yes, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12308)|
| 3:25:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12310)|
| 3:25:11| You just made a comment that they can't build in the floodway without MPC approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| Buzz, could you give us a list of what can be built in the floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12317)|
| 3:25:22| Because my understanding was very, very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12322)|
| 3:25:26| Or Mark, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| It's actually that no significant vegetation be removed from the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12328)|
| 3:25:33| until we approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12333)|
| 3:25:36| That's not what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12336)|
| 3:25:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| Frankly, nothing will be built until the development plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| Is this a whole piece of property in the floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12351)|
| 3:25:52| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| You cannot build anything that's permanent in a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12355)|
| 3:26:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| You have the right to do a limited number of improvements in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| You also have the right to reclaim a certain percentage of that floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12368)|
| 3:26:15| which is different than the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| Yeah, back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| The floodway is defined essentially as a no-build area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12380)|
| 3:26:26| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| He was speaking about the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12388)|
| 3:26:31| We interchange too easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12391)|
| 3:26:37| There are some very limited things that you can do within the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12397)|
| 3:26:43| but basically no significant construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| The greenway would go in there, as I understand from what the Beaver Creek Greenway Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12407)|
| 3:26:56| has proposed using that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| I don't know whether that means paving or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12419)|
| 3:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12424)|
| 3:27:05| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| Commissioner, we've been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| I've been out there with Mr. Connor probably some six months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| and met with him at a community meeting, an MPC meeting that had, I think, on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12432)|
| 3:27:18| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12438)|
| 3:27:19| I think it is a good idea, but here's the problem that we've got with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12439)|
| 3:27:24| We've got 17 acres right there on a major, major road, and there's no contract in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| And from what I'm hearing from the community is they don't want us to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12449)|
| 3:27:33| without we knowing for sure what's going to be on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12453)|
| 3:27:38| So do we have a contract in hand, Mr. Connor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12458)|
| 3:27:43| I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12463)|
| 3:27:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| The real estate broker is out of town today, as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12467)|
| 3:27:51| Without a contract in hand, you know, gentlemen, I've heard from several people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12471)|
| 3:27:58| and we have talked, you and I both know what is looking to come in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| which I think is a good idea and be a great tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12481)|
| 3:28:05| But they're also looking at other sites there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12485)|
| 3:28:08| And until you get something in hand that we can talk something specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12488)|
| 3:28:12| this is what it's going to be, I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| I do not have, Commissioner Smith, a contract in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12496)|
| 3:28:20| I think, and I'm sort of in a chicken and egg situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12500)|
| 3:28:25| I asked the realtor and the potential buyer does not want their identity disclosed until,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12505)|
| 3:28:35| I think there are several sites they're looking at out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| Until the zoning occurs, they will not put down hard money on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12519)|
| 3:28:47| Now, whether they will relent on that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12527)|
| 3:28:51| I have not been dealing with it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| I've been assisting Mr. Connor with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12533)|
| 3:28:58| But, you know, Mr. Connor, if you had something in writing from them saying that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12538)|
| 3:29:04| and we can disguise who it would be, author some ways to not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| I can get you that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| You know, and I hope that you are the winner on this, Mr. Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| But until we have something, I'm not going to be able to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| Well, I would ask for a 30-day postponement and get the realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12557)|
| 3:29:21| Whatever you all want, because this is Mr. Connor's retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12561)|
| 3:29:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12567)|
| 3:29:28| And we've talked about that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| He's owned this property for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12570)|
| 3:29:36| His family has owned it for 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| This is what he and his wife and family are going to live off of for the rest of their time here on this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12578)|
| 3:29:47| And if the maker of the motion wants to make something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12587)|
| 3:29:52| if you want to do something for 30 to 60 days until they can get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12592)|
| 3:29:57| I'm just amazed that, you know, it's going to be commercial anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12597)|
| 3:30:02| Why are we delaying the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12602)|
| 3:30:05| I mean, it's on a four-lane state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12605)|
| 3:30:07| It's going to be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12607)|
| 3:30:08| It's right in the middle of the plan for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12608)|
| 3:30:11| I mean, if it's ABC Electric or if it's Widget 123 put in there, it doesn't matter who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12611)|
| 3:30:19| It's just the guy can't get anything there until it's zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12619)|
| 3:30:22| I mean, it's going to go commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12622)|
| 3:30:26| It's going to go planned commercial, whether it's this month or next month or six months, because it's where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12626)|
| 3:30:32| So, either way, does it matter if we have a tenant or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| I can't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12636)|
| 3:30:41| Okay, any other comments, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12641)|
| 3:30:46| Okay, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| I'm just wondering, Arthur, you made a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| You said that, you know, these people are not willing to enter into a negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12652)|
| 3:30:55| and sign a contract if they're not sure if the zoning is going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12655)|
| 3:30:59| I mean, if I'm in their position, I'm not going to want to put down money either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12659)|
| 3:31:03| And so, like you say, you're kind of in a catch-22 situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12663)|
| 3:31:07| Is there anything else this property could be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| Because if it's going to be commercial anyway and if somebody is going to come in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| does it matter if it's this tenant that you're talking about or if it's someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12674)|
| 3:31:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12678)|
| 3:31:19| I have directed a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12679)|
| 3:31:24| We've been talking about this, as Commissioner Smith said, for six months or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12684)|
| 3:31:29| And I deal with people who come to town looking for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12689)|
| 3:31:34| And, excuse me, sometimes I do not direct them to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12694)|
| 3:31:38| I said there are other areas of the county, especially along Emory Road, that are underserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12698)|
| 3:31:45| that need good commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| And the demographics and everything support it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12707)|
| 3:31:51| So I suspect there will be other people looking at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12711)|
| 3:31:54| even if the letter of intent or option they have in place does not go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12714)|
| 3:32:00| because it is a nice tract of land well situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12720)|
| 3:32:04| You know, it's sort of, like you say, what comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12724)|
| 3:32:11| I mean, you've got to have property zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| or that can be zoned before anybody will invest any serious money in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12734)|
| 3:32:22| That's the dilemma we're here with for Mr. Conner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| Well, I want to help Mr. Conner, because, like you're saying, this is what he wants to use to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| His family is depending on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| That's what I'm hearing you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| And so he wants to sell, and he knows that to sell he needs to get his property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| And so if it's going to be commercial anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12761)|
| 3:32:44| and I don't really know that if this person that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12764)|
| 3:32:47| if they're going to enter into negotiations, if they don't know what the zoning is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12767)|
| 3:32:53| I don't really see a need for a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12776)|
| 3:33:00| Yes, state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| My name is Sam Conner, and the property we're talking about is in my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12782)|
| 3:33:07| And I do want to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12787)|
| 3:33:11| And that's what I've been running into, Mr. Hammond, is what you talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12791)|
| 3:33:14| They want it rezoned before they commit hard money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12794)|
| 3:33:19| And so I've got a piece of property with no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| But that would be good for the pile, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| I mean, the ones we're talking to would be good tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| And I don't blame them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| They're not going to put down any hard money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| If they can't get it rezoned, so we can get it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| Simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12817)|
| 3:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12818)|
| 3:33:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12819)|
| 3:33:40| Thank you, Mr. Conner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12820)|
| 3:33:41| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12821)|
| 3:33:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| Commissioner Smith, not help me just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12824)|
| 3:33:51| not wanting to know who might be buying it or what it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12831)|
| 3:33:55| but knowing that the zoning is going to be planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12835)|
| 3:34:02| what are your constituents out there concerned with might be there that they don't really want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12842)|
| 3:34:09| or what would they prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| Help me with that kind of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| They don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| They want to know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12855)|
| 3:34:18| If he doesn't get this bid with this company, then it's up for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12858)|
| 3:34:26| They want to know what it is that the community is getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| They'd have some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12872)|
| 3:34:33| Let me go back out here to the desk and ask, in P.C., what is possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12873)|
| 3:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12885)|
| 3:34:46| That mic isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12886)|
| 3:34:49| I will remind you that we just adopted an update to the North County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12889)|
| 3:34:56| This particular intersection was the one significant change to the North County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12896)|
| 3:35:03| It was changed to allow a mix of uses, which included commercial at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12903)|
| 3:35:11| Mr. Conner and his neighbors were diligent about attending our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12911)|
| 3:35:16| and attended them regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12916)|
| 3:35:20| We're at all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| The Sector Plan contemplates a mix of residential and commercial uses at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12925)|
| 3:35:34| and the planned commercial zone request is consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12934)|
| 3:35:39| And then I would also take this opportunity to caution the commission against negotiating with this landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12939)|
| 3:35:48| that begins to approach the concept of contract zoning, which is not looked upon kindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12948)|
| 3:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12956)|
| 3:35:57| So let me state my question just a little bit more specifically then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12957)|
| 3:36:02| What could be in a P.C. zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12962)|
| 3:36:06| Motels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| The planned commercial zoning is extremely liberal in its uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12971)|
| 3:36:16| You simply have to declare them during the development plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12976)|
| 3:36:22| But in going through that process, the surrounding community gets to look at everything that will be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12982)|
| 3:36:30| and we have a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| and the Planning Commission then approves the literal development plan and the list of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12992)|
| 3:36:39| As part of that approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| there are restrictive covenants then that are put in place to keep those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13002)|
| 3:36:49| and to more succinctly codify the conditions of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13009)|
| 3:36:56| Fast food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13016)|
| 3:36:58| It can be done, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13018)|
| 3:37:00| Strip malls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13020)|
| 3:37:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13021)|
| 3:37:02| But not medical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| You can do medical uses, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| So there is a wide range of things that could be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13027)|
| 3:37:14| but the community is going to have input into how it sits and where it's lit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13034)|
| 3:37:20| and you all will have input into the vegetation not only in the floodway but in the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13040)|
| 3:37:26| and there's going to be 20-foot public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13046)|
| 3:37:32| Is that path, trail, or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| One of the conditions of the zoning is that provisions be made for the extension of the greenway through that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13055)|
| 3:37:42| And on the south side, it's Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| And on the west side, then back up to Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13067)|
| 3:37:51| there's not any usable property of an adjoining neighbor, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13071)|
| 3:37:57| Doesn't the west side bound up to the Beaver Creek floodplain literally comes up to Emery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13077)|
| 3:38:04| Okay, so there really isn't an adjacent neighbor other than frogs and cattails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13084)|
| 3:38:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13091)|
| 3:38:12| In making our recommendations on the sector plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13092)|
| 3:38:15| we took into consideration that we had a natural boundary with Beaver Creek there on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13095)|
| 3:38:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13102)|
| 3:38:23| I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, but I can't really see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13103)|
| 3:38:28| This is really being on the fence, but I believe there's enough here before me to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13108)|
| 3:38:36| the property owner needs to be able to pursue converting his real estate, converting his dirt into cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13116)|
| 3:38:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13125)|
| 3:38:46| And, Commissioner, I have information I cannot divulge at this time about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13126)|
| 3:38:50| and the negotiations that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13130)|
| 3:38:53| And if you all want to approve it, you know, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| But I just caution Mr. Carney, you know, taxes are going out next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13135)|
| 3:38:58| and you're going to be taxed at a commercial rate starting for October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13138)|
| 3:39:03| And, you know, I hope you get that piece from it because otherwise, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13143)|
| 3:39:09| if you don't get that contract, you're going to be paying the commercial rate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13149)|
| 3:39:13| So, good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13153)|
| 3:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13158)|
| 3:39:19| One last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| Commissioners, you know I'm pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13160)|
| 3:39:22| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13162)|
| 3:39:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13165)|
| 3:39:26| We have a motion to approve with these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13168)|
| 3:39:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13170)|
| 3:39:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13174)|
| 3:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| Eight ayes, two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13194)|
| 3:39:55| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13195)|
| 3:39:59| Next up, Mr. Conner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13199)|
| 3:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13203)|
| 3:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13206)|
| 3:40:08| Thank you, Mr. Conner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13208)|
| 3:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13212)|
| 3:40:13| Under Zoning Appeals 7-C-12-RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13213)|
| 3:40:18| appeal by James A. and Tammy S. Bennett of MPC denial of rezoning from A. Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13218)|
| 3:40:23| to C.A. General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| The property located northwest side of Apache Road, northwest of Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13225)|
| 3:40:29| in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13233)|
| 3:40:34| We have a letter that you received from Nolan Sharble that requests to put this off for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13234)|
| 3:40:46| I think we have some of the representatives of the appeal here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13246)|
| 3:40:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13254)|
| 3:40:55| My name is Nolan Sharble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13255)|
| 3:40:56| I'm at 108 Durwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13256)|
| 3:41:00| And I did request that after talking with a couple of the commissioners about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13260)|
| 3:41:06| we're not, we haven't had the opportunity to really talk with the neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| And we think that maybe if we did, we could find out what the real objections to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13269)|
| 3:41:16| applying for C.A. zoning and perhaps eliminating one of the objections that MPC has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13276)|
| 3:41:24| that is not having a direct right-of-way to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13284)|
| 3:41:29| And we've contacted neighbors on the west of us whose property is industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13289)|
| 3:41:37| and then the property south is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| And that's what we're looking to do is try to gain a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13299)|
| 3:41:43| And if we had a couple of weeks to do that, we could perhaps know where we really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13303)|
| 3:41:49| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13309)|
| 3:41:50| I think we need something on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13310)|
| 3:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13311)|
| 3:41:52| And we're about to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| Mr. Wright, would you like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13313)|
| 3:41:57| No, we're calling a catch-22 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| If I have to make a motion, I need to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13320)|
| 3:42:02| That doesn't necessarily mean that you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13322)|
| 3:42:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13323)|
| 3:42:04| I need to ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13326)|
| 3:42:07| Can I do that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| And then I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13331)|
| 3:42:14| Because what I'm going to ask the law director is a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13334)|
| 3:42:17| He's going to give me four or five words that I couldn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| We need to act on this tonight and defer because they've written us a letter asking for deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13342)|
| 3:42:34| and we cannot uphold or deny because we would be doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13354)|
| 3:42:38| I'm afraid I'm not going to give you the four or five word answer that you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13358)|
| 3:42:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13361)|
| 3:42:42| Give me a ten word answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13362)|
| 3:42:44| This matter is probably before the commission on appeal from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13364)|
| 3:42:49| The Planning Commission has recommended denial and the applicant, the appellee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13369)|
| 3:42:56| the person appealing the denial of the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13376)|
| 3:42:59| is requesting that the commission defer this matter for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13379)|
| 3:43:04| You could defer the matter for 30 days or you can affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13384)|
| 3:43:09| or overrule the decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13389)|
| 3:43:12| To affirm the Metropolitan Planning Commission would basically deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13392)|
| 3:43:17| To overrule the MPC would be to grant the rezoning or to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13397)|
| 3:43:22| Obviously, you'll defer and consider it at your next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13402)|
| 3:43:27| I didn't get the answer I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| I was looking for fewer words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| Move to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13413)|
| 3:43:34| We have a motion to defer for 30 days and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13414)|
| 3:43:37| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13417)|
| 3:43:42| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13422)|
| 3:43:43| Hey, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13423)|
| 3:43:44| I guess I'm just trying to figure out what we're going to accomplish in this 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13424)|
| 3:43:54| So what I would like to get an understanding of is from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13434)|
| 3:43:59| It sounds like there's been a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| Something's happened to get a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| So I guess could you all give me a brief rundown on why we're here and why you all denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13443)|
| 3:44:13| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13453)|
| 3:44:22| Buzz Johnson, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13462)|
| 3:44:26| The staff made a recommendation to the commission that they denied not only the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13466)|
| 3:44:32| but there was also an accompanying plan amendment with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| So both of the requests were denied at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13475)|
| 3:44:39| The applicant, in keeping with process, can appeal the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13479)|
| 3:44:42| but they can't appeal the plan amendment at this particular juncture because that was denied by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13482)|
| 3:44:50| Going through the reasons for denial, there was neighborhood opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13490)|
| 3:44:55| which I think has been alluded to by the appellants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13495)|
| 3:44:59| But there was neighborhood opposition, but also there was some planning issues involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13499)|
| 3:45:03| some site issues involved in terms of the access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13503)|
| 3:45:07| There is no direct access from this property to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| You have to use Apache Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| And although I don't think this lot is a part of that subdivision that is on Apache Road and Mount Air Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13513)|
| 3:45:23| it is set back from the Rutledge Pike enough to where it is back within that kind of residential area back from Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13523)|
| 3:45:33| The staff found no changes in conditions in the area that warrant this particular rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13533)|
| 3:45:39| There was another rezoning just to the south of that was approved sometime back with conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13539)|
| 3:45:46| that is a little bit more close to Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13546)|
| 3:45:51| and would have less of a detrimental effect developed in commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13551)|
| 3:45:56| But you get further back off of Rutledge Pike with this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13556)|
| 3:46:01| you're looking at rezoning possibly the lot to the east of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13561)|
| 3:46:06| and you get further and you affect more and more that residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13566)|
| 3:46:11| So the staff didn't feel this was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13571)|
| 3:46:15| There were too many things that we felt uncomfortable with in terms of recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13575)|
| 3:46:20| The Planning Commission supported the staff recommendation by a vote of 12 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13580)|
| 3:46:27| As I said, they denied the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| I don't want to disagree with the law director, but we need to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13593)|
| 3:46:37| You could go ahead, as far as we're concerned, and either postpone the request for rezoning or deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13597)|
| 3:46:44| I don't think you can hear the rezoning with the idea that you're going to approve it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13604)|
| 3:46:49| because you have to, according to state law, you have to initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13609)|
| 3:46:54| If you're inclined to have a discussion on the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| you have to initiate that as your own initiation in terms of a County Commission request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13618)|
| 3:47:04| Then both of those have to go back through the circuit, the loop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| back to NPC for consideration of both of those again based on your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13628)|
| 3:47:13| Then at that time, regardless of what NPC does, that can come back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13633)|
| 3:47:18| and you can consider both to be able to rezone the property if that's the inclination of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13638)|
| 3:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13646)|
| 3:47:27| Thank you, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13647)|
| 3:47:28| I will get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13648)|
| 3:47:29| I don't want to argue with the law director, but I think that's the way the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13649)|
| 3:47:34| and that's the practice that we've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13654)|
| 3:47:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13656)|
| 3:47:37| And the gentleman in the green shirt, I will get to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| You can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| Yes, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| I know that you all are opposing the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13661)|
| 3:47:45| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13665)|
| 3:47:46| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| I'm in complete agreement with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13668)|
| 3:47:50| and see that there is no plan amendment before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13670)|
| 3:47:57| It's only a request of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| And the reason I was asking the law director about the do we have to consider this deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13679)|
| 3:48:07| or can we dispense with the deferral and go directly to the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13687)|
| 3:48:13| And I sort of got the impression that we would be denying them due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13693)|
| 3:48:20| if we went directly to the question without giving them the benefit of the 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13700)|
| 3:48:27| That's the reason I made my motion for deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13707)|
| 3:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13710)|
| 3:48:34| I will amend my motion then and support the MPC and affirm their denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13714)|
| 3:48:45| And now we'll look at it from a different point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13725)|
| 3:48:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13728)|
| 3:48:49| So we've got a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13729)|
| 3:48:52| You wish to substitute your own motion, change your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13732)|
| 3:48:58| Or withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| Withdraw your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13740)|
| 3:49:01| Or amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13741)|
| 3:49:02| Why don't we withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13742)|
| 3:49:03| Let's withdraw your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13745)|
| 3:49:06| You wish to withdraw your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13746)|
| 3:49:07| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13750)|
| 3:49:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13751)|
| 3:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13752)|
| 3:49:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13753)|
| 3:49:14| Now, would you like to make a new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13754)|
| 3:49:16| Move to affirm the decision of MPC and affirm the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13756)|
| 3:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13761)|
| 3:49:22| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13762)|
| 3:49:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13763)|
| 3:49:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13764)|
| 3:49:25| Any other discussion of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13765)|
| 3:49:31| Are we going to be hearing from both sides now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13773)|
| 3:49:34| We should hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13774)|
| 3:49:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13775)|
| 3:49:36| We can hear from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13776)|
| 3:49:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| The motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Mr. Sharma, you want to go again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13782)|
| 3:49:45| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13786)|
| 3:49:48| As the MPC suggests, my client is trying to bring this property they've used for their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13788)|
| 3:49:56| for about the last 10 or 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| They're trying to bring its use in compliance to the zoning or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13798)|
| 3:50:02| And, of course, it's, you know, the amount of traffic that they've created is not any more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13802)|
| 3:50:11| the property comes up, normally travels up and down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13811)|
| 3:50:15| They buy and sell cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13815)|
| 3:50:16| They have a lot off-site where they actually sell their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13816)|
| 3:50:20| But it supports the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13820)|
| 3:50:23| It has about four workers that work there and provides a service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13823)|
| 3:50:29| But it being practical for them to move the equipment because of the size of it to another site at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13829)|
| 3:50:43| and the proximity to Rutledge Pike without using the present road, Apache Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13843)|
| 3:50:54| that's the only right of way both into the residential subdivision as well as to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13854)|
| 3:50:59| And they're bound on the west by an industrial track that has used tankers in and out every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13859)|
| 3:51:12| a large number of tankers, trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13872)|
| 3:51:14| And then, of course, probably immediately south of them is a commercial RV center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13874)|
| 3:51:19| which means that there's a lot of mobile home RVs that travel in and out of that area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13879)|
| 3:51:30| Our use, our request is consistent with the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13890)|
| 3:51:34| because we're a buffer, I guess, to the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13894)|
| 3:51:40| And as correctly stated by MPC, our property is not part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13900)|
| 3:51:47| It is a separate subdivided track still zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13907)|
| 3:51:52| except for the parts that have been rezoned to industrial and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13912)|
| 3:51:57| We think it would be appropriate to allow us to obtain a CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13917)|
| 3:52:03| so that we could complete or continue to do our work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13923)|
| 3:52:09| Okay. All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| The gentleman in the back, would you like to speak, sir, to, I assume, to uphold the denial of the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13931)|
| 3:52:18| My name is Kent Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13938)|
| 3:52:20| I live at 1908 Mount Air Drive in the Mount Air subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13940)|
| 3:52:25| I'm here representing our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| There's three other people here, my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13947)|
| 3:52:31| We came before the MPC, and this was denied by MPC because if you look at the plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13951)|
| 3:52:38| there is no access to this property except from Apache Drive, and it's at a 90-degree curve in Apache Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13958)|
| 3:52:45| We frequently see trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13965)|
| 3:52:50| They pull trailers up with wrecked cars on them in that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13970)|
| 3:52:54| Their driveway comes off right at the 90 degrees of that curve at Apache Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13974)|
| 3:53:01| They unload cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13981)|
| 3:53:02| They partially block the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13982)|
| 3:53:05| That's the only entrance we have to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13985)|
| 3:53:08| Our subdivision, Mount Air Drive, is a dead end on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13988)|
| 3:53:12| It was cut off from Rutledge Pike numerous years ago when Rutledge Pike was widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13992)|
| 3:53:16| and Apache Drive was created at that time for access to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=13996)|
| 3:53:21| We frequently hear noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| We hear grinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14003)|
| 3:53:24| We hear hammering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14004)|
| 3:53:26| We hear all kinds of stuff at all hours of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14006)|
| 3:53:29| It goes on until late in the night after the dark sets in, and it's just not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14009)|
| 3:53:37| The property they're talking about that's to the south of them is owned by John Story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14017)|
| 3:53:42| It was agricultural, and it was changed to commercial for the purposes of the RV place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14022)|
| 3:53:52| They have a direct access to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14032)|
| 3:53:55| They use Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14035)|
| 3:53:56| They have a driveway onto Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14036)|
| 3:53:59| They do not access Apache Drive whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| There is a fence there that separates their property from Apache Drive, so they cannot access Apache Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14041)|
| 3:54:08| Now, these people have no other way to access their property except Apache Drive, just like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14048)|
| 3:54:17| I know they're not part of our subdivision, but they're infringing on our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14057)|
| 3:54:21| We've already been stepped on enough with this other property being commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14061)|
| 3:54:25| We already have commercial on the entrance to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| Granted, it does have Rutledge Pike access, but we've already been treaded on long enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14068)|
| 3:54:33| and we don't need anything else in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14073)|
| 3:54:37| It's just noise, and frequently they park cars down on the corner of Rutledge Pike and Apache Drive for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14077)|
| 3:54:46| We were told that that stopped, that they had some property to sell these cars somewhere over on Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14086)|
| 3:54:52| Since then, I've taken pictures of cars parked down there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14092)|
| 3:54:56| And so we're in opposition to that, and there's four of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14096)|
| 3:55:02| And I also have a petition signed by everyone in our neighborhood that I'd like to submit for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14102)|
| 3:55:09| stating that we are opposed to this and that we want it denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14109)|
| 3:55:15| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14117)|
| 3:55:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14119)|
| 3:55:21| Can we put the map up on the screen of the plat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14121)|
| 3:55:26| I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| Yesterday was my -- I didn't have a staff going with me, Commissioner Wright, but I was touring yesterday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14129)|
| 3:55:34| I should have called you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14134)|
| 3:55:35| We could have sunshined it, or I could have used your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14135)|
| 3:55:39| But anyway, I went out and viewed the property, and I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14139)|
| 3:55:46| Yeah, no, I was going to see if we can pull it up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| See, I'm high-tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14152)|
| 3:55:53| I've got me one of these little red-button things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14153)|
| 3:55:58| I think he's going with Atlas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14158)|
| 3:56:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14177)|
| 3:56:18| So right here is the Apache, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14178)|
| 3:56:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14182)|
| 3:56:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14183)|
| 3:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14184)|
| 3:56:25| I guess the question I have is, in driving up Apache, you have the RV right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14185)|
| 3:56:30| This is Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| And you have the RVs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14192)|
| 3:56:34| Your property is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14194)|
| 3:56:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| Or the property asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14197)|
| 3:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14198)|
| 3:56:39| Now, this property here, it looked to be there was a building there, and there was a little picnic table out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14199)|
| 3:56:46| What is this property right here adjacent to it used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14206)|
| 3:56:50| I believe the man that owns that runs a heating and air business out of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14210)|
| 3:56:55| And so how much activity would he have on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14215)|
| 3:57:00| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14220)|
| 3:57:01| Is it commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14221)|
| 3:57:05| So he's operating a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14227)|
| 3:57:13| I'm sorry, I can't hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14233)|
| 3:57:19| He's storing his parts to build his supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| I'm sorry, sir, we need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14241)|
| 3:57:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14244)|
| 3:57:25| James Bennett, 1825 Apache Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14245)|
| 3:57:29| But he's building a house, I guess, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14249)|
| 3:57:32| And he's just saving his building materials a little out of time, I guess, to build his house is what he's told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14252)|
| 3:57:38| So there's no business activity going on there in this property here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14262)|
| 3:57:43| But he gave me a letter stating that he did not have a problem with what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14263)|
| 3:57:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14267)|
| 3:57:48| Now let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14268)|
| 3:57:49| This property here looked to be just agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14269)|
| 3:57:52| It looked to be a field with so there's nothing going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14272)|
| 3:57:56| It's owned privately, I guess, by somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14276)|
| 3:57:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14278)|
| 3:57:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14279)|
| 3:58:00| And then your subdivision is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14280)|
| 3:58:01| So the way to get in is through this way, and that's the only entrance to your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14281)|
| 3:58:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14285)|
| 3:58:06| Now, Mr. Charble, you were saying that your clients, I guess Mr. Bennett, you could answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14286)|
| 3:58:12| How would you get your – would you go through here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14292)|
| 3:58:15| Because you said that if you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| I was going to talk – I've been talking with John Storey about purchasing a right of way through his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14297)|
| 3:58:23| and I was going to come across the bottom of my yard and come up and block my driveway off on Apache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14303)|
| 3:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14309)|
| 3:58:30| So you'd block your driveway off here and you'd come down what, like this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14312)|
| 3:58:33| And cut across the bottom of my yard with the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14313)|
| 3:58:36| And then you would come out here on Rutledge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14316)|
| 3:58:39| I'd be using John Storey's entrance to Rutledge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14319)|
| 3:58:42| So what you're saying then is you would not be using the entrance into Apache if you got this right of way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14322)|
| 3:58:47| Exactly, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14327)|
| 3:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14328)|
| 3:58:49| Now, what about this noise and what about the – because I read the MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14329)|
| 3:58:53| In the MPC report, the neighbors were saying that there was a lot of noise going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14333)|
| 3:58:57| and that's just what the gentleman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14337)|
| 3:58:59| Are you working all hours of the day and night there, or what exactly are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14339)|
| 3:59:03| We usually shut down about 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| But, you know, the tractor-trailer place and those tractor-trailers, they work on them late at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14345)|
| 3:59:10| banging, clanging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14350)|
| 3:59:12| They're coming in and out right next door to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14352)|
| 3:59:16| My neighbor Harold, he works on some of his cars sometimes over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14356)|
| 3:59:19| and so he's clanging and banging too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14359)|
| 3:59:21| I mean, you know, it's just a little bit of everybody, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14361)|
| 3:59:25| I can't – usually the latest I'm out there at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14365)|
| 3:59:29| So you're saying some of the noise is the result of these RV people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14369)|
| 3:59:33| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14373)|
| 3:59:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14374)|
| 3:59:35| They're in that tractor-trailer place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14375)|
| 3:59:36| It's right beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14379)|
| 3:59:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| I just wanted to kind of get a better feel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14381)|
| 3:59:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14382)|
| 3:59:43| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14383)|
| 3:59:44| Mr. Phillips, you want to respond, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14384)|
| 3:59:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14387)|
| 3:59:49| What he said about the RV place making noise, they don't make any noise after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14389)|
| 3:59:53| They close, and you can look at their posted hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14393)|
| 3:59:57| I didn't write them down, but they are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| They're closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14399)|
| 4:00:00| They close early on Saturday, and they're closed by the time the sun goes down or before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14400)|
| 4:00:07| every Monday through Friday, and they're closed on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14407)|
| 4:00:10| They don't make the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14410)|
| 4:00:11| We get out and walk in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| We walk around that curve on Apache all the time down to the stop sign at Rutledge Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14414)|
| 4:00:18| and we know where the noise comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14418)|
| 4:00:21| They have three or four garages on this property already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14421)|
| 4:00:28| They have one that's attached to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| I believe it's like a double-car garage, and then they have another garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14430)|
| 4:00:35| and then they have a large garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| There's at least two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14437)|
| 4:00:38| I don't know how you would want to count them by garage doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14438)|
| 4:00:40| There's four garage doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14440)|
| 4:00:42| So when we were at MPC, they stated that they were running a hobby business, whatever you want to call that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14442)|
| 4:00:49| I'm not sure what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14449)|
| 4:00:51| By definition, the MPC didn't know what a hobby business was either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14451)|
| 4:00:55| But, granted, they're running a full-blown car repair place here on agricultural property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14455)|
| 4:01:01| and we get to reap all the traffic of them unloading all these cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14461)|
| 4:01:06| Like I said, we hear all the noise, and there is noise from there all hours of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14466)|
| 4:01:13| up until probably 11 or 12 o'clock sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14473)|
| 4:01:16| And that is no exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14476)|
| 4:01:19| How long have they been in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14479)|
| 4:01:20| I mean, I guess I need to ask him, how long have they been in business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| How long have they been doing this hobby business or been in business doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14482)|
| 4:01:28| They've been doing this business between 10 and 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14488)|
| 4:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14493)|
| 4:01:34| The lady, I don't know if the lady wanted to speak or not, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14494)|
| 4:01:39| Go ahead, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| You want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14501)|
| 4:01:42| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| My name is Tammy Bennett, 1825 Apache Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14504)|
| 4:01:47| Sir, this is not a full-blown corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14507)|
| 4:01:50| This is a my son owns a frame machine that he pulls his own cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14510)|
| 4:01:57| He does it as a hobby, but they didn't understand hobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14517)|
| 4:02:01| These are all my cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| These are no customer cars, nothing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14523)|
| 4:02:06| These are my son's cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14526)|
| 4:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14529)|
| 4:02:10| It's not a dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14530)|
| 4:02:11| I own a car lot on Greenway Drive to where I take the cars that he fixes, that's his, and put them there to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14531)|
| 4:02:19| The cars that they claim that's at the end of the road is not owned by, it's owned by John Story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14539)|
| 4:02:25| And they're not my cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14545)|
| 4:02:26| They're somebody else's cars from the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14546)|
| 4:02:29| I have no reason to put cars down there when I have a car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14549)|
| 4:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14553)|
| 4:02:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14554)|
| 4:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14557)|
| 4:02:38| Other items here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14558)|
| 4:02:39| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14559)|
| 4:02:41| I think as the conversation draws to a close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14561)|
| 4:02:45| the problem that we'll have is if we do a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14565)|
| 4:02:49| then we're bumping into initiating a sector plan change, and I'll not tackle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14569)|
| 4:02:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14577)|
| 4:02:58| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14578)|
| 4:02:59| Just to clarify a point, a hobby is incidental usage of a particular kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14579)|
| 4:03:11| Fixing cars on a regular basis to go to another place to sell is not a hobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14591)|
| 4:03:15| That's a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| And I think Mr. Braden would attest to that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14597)|
| 4:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14602)|

| 4:06:00| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14760)|

| 4:06:05| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14767)|
| 4:06:08| The scheduling of public meetings, I have a request from one of the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14768)|
| 4:06:17| of signs that not occur during Knox County schools break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14777)|
| 4:06:24| I don't know when that is or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14784)|
| 4:06:26| But I believe we need to observe that from our own point of view that we not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14786)|
| 4:06:30| schedule that public meeting when Knox County schools are on fall break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14790)|
| 4:06:35| or whatever break we got, they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14795)|
| 4:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14800)|
| 4:06:41| Is it advisable that we go ahead and schedule the public meeting right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14801)|
| 4:06:48| Is that what we need to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14808)|
| 4:06:53| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| As I said in the luncheon, my understanding when we left here last Monday was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14818)|
| 4:07:05| that the representatives of the sign industry, Knox Heritage, yada, yada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14825)|
| 4:07:11| law department, whoever, and John Doe were supposed to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14831)|
| 4:07:15| and bring a recommendation to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14835)|
| 4:07:20| and to a forum that would be held to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14840)|
| 4:07:27| You're looking at me quizzically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| That's not what you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14849)|
| 4:07:32| Public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14852)|
| 4:07:36| Are you talking to me, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14856)|
| 4:07:38| I was talking to Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14858)|
| 4:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14859)|
| 4:07:42| She had this quizzical look on her face like, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14862)|
| 4:07:49| I don't remember if we gave instruction for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14869)|
| 4:07:53| or if anything that was clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14873)|
| 4:07:56| All I remember is that the new Lamar fellow was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14876)|
| 4:08:04| and he wanted to participate in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14884)|
| 4:08:07| And so we need to give him some guidance as to how he can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14887)|
| 4:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14895)|
| 4:08:16| Ms. Bross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14896)|
| 4:08:17| All I remember is he was pushing pretty hard to be included in writing the crafting of the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14897)|
| 4:08:24| and I object to the business being regulated being the one actually writing the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14904)|
| 4:08:31| They may do that in Washington, but I don't like for us to do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14911)|
| 4:08:36| And if we did that, we would have to also include the opposition in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14916)|
| 4:08:40| And I think what Rick Briggs and I were saying was that we want to just look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14920)|
| 4:08:44| we can start with just what the city's got and move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14924)|
| 4:08:48| So I think we were asking MPC to go ahead and write those broken into three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14928)|
| 4:08:55| Is that what you remember, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| in that we would defer it for two months and have two public hearings in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14937)|
| 4:09:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14942)|
| 4:09:03| The discussion last Monday focused on three specific actions that you wanted to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14943)|
| 4:09:10| One was expanding the prohibition to billboards to all of the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14950)|
| 4:09:16| The Planning Commission has already made a recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14956)|
| 4:09:19| You've got that in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14959)|
| 4:09:22| Another item was regulating the electronic message centers in a manner consistent with what the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14962)|
| 4:09:32| You already have a recommendation from the Planning Commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14972)|
| 4:09:36| The one new item that came up last Monday was the idea of converting existing billboards to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14976)|
| 4:09:45| We haven't weighed in on that at this point, and we have scheduled that item on our October agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14985)|
| 4:09:51| So by our October 11th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14991)|
| 4:09:54| we will have a recommendation on that for the Planning Commission to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14994)|
| 4:09:58| and then they will in turn make a recommendation to inform your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=14998)|
| 4:10:03| At the same time, you've said you're going to have public meetings, and we'll be at all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15003)|
| 4:10:09| So we need to schedule our public meetings after your October 11th meeting if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15009)|
| 4:10:14| It doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15014)|
| 4:10:15| It would be easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15015)|
| 4:10:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15019)|
| 4:10:20| In fact, it might be better if you're going to have two to have one before our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15020)|
| 4:10:24| and that will help inform our recommendation to our Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15024)|
| 4:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15028)|
| 4:10:31| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| The fall break is October 18th and 19th on Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15033)|
| 4:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15039)|
| 4:10:40| Does somebody want to go into the calendar and start offering some times, dates for the public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15040)|
| 4:10:48| We're going to do two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15048)|
| 4:10:49| Let's go ahead with one before October 11th and one after, but avoiding the 18th and 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15049)|
| 4:11:01| Let's throw something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15061)|
| 4:11:03| What about October 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15063)|
| 4:11:05| October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15065)|
| 4:11:07| The Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15067)|
| 4:11:08| That's next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15068)|
| 4:11:13| That's bad for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15073)|
| 4:11:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15074)|
| 4:11:16| How much notice do we have to have for the public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15076)|
| 4:11:20| Forty-eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15080)|
| 4:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15085)|
| 4:11:26| How about October 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15086)|
| 4:11:32| I'll be turning 45 on the 8th, so if somebody wants to bring a birthday cake, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15092)|
| 4:11:36| I'm right there with you, girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15096)|
| 4:11:37| Not if it's a night one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15097)|
| 4:11:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15098)|
| 4:11:39| It's Larry's birthday, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| Are we talking about a daytime or nighttime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15101)|
| 4:11:45| Yeah, after work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15105)|
| 4:11:46| I wanted one of each, if you remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15106)|
| 4:11:48| After work, the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15108)|
| 4:11:50| Monday night don't work for me on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15110)|
| 4:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15112)|
| 4:11:58| Thursday the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15118)|
| 4:11:59| How about Thursday the 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15119)|
| 4:12:02| It'll need to be daytime for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15122)|
| 4:12:06| Can't be night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15126)|
| 4:12:08| Can't be night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15128)|
| 4:12:09| Can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15129)|
| 4:12:10| I can't do the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15130)|
| 4:12:12| Day is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15132)|
| 4:12:14| It sounds like day on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| Does daytime on the 8th work for you, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| Daytime on the 8th works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15140)|
| 4:12:21| How about going daytime on the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| Okay, daytime on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15143)|
| 4:12:24| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15144)|
| 4:12:25| 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15145)|
| 4:12:26| 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15146)|
| 4:12:27| 2 works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15147)|
| 4:12:28| 2 o'clock on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15148)|
| 4:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15151)|
| 4:12:32| Any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15152)|
| 4:12:33| 2 o'clock on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| First public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15155)|
| 4:12:38| Jolie, do you know if the room is available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15158)|
| 4:12:43| We can assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15163)|
| 4:12:44| One or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15164)|
| 4:12:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15166)|
| 4:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15167)|
| 4:12:48| We're going to assume that'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15168)|
| 4:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15172)|
| 4:12:53| Notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15173)|
| 4:12:54| How will the notice work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15174)|
| 4:12:56| You'll take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15176)|
| 4:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15178)|
| 4:12:59| So we've got Thursday, October 8th, 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15179)|
| 4:13:02| That's Monday, honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15183)|
| 4:13:04| Was that a Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15184)|
| 4:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15185)|
| 4:13:06| Monday, October 8th, 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15186)|
| 4:13:09| And we'll say in the large unless we can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15189)|
| 4:13:14| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15194)|
| 4:13:16| Jolie will notice this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15196)|
| 4:13:18| Also, Mr. Chairman, will all the individuals here be given five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15198)|
| 4:13:23| Do we want to stay with the five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15203)|
| 4:13:25| Let's stay with the five-minute rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15207)|
| 4:13:28| Is that okay with the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15208)|
| 4:13:30| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15210)|
| 4:13:32| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15212)|
| 4:13:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15214)|
| 4:13:37| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| If you're going to have industry input, that's very difficult to do in five minutes for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15219)|
| 4:13:49| Seriously, that's why I thought we were going with the committee type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15229)|
| 4:13:52| to become a recommendation first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15232)|
| 4:13:54| because it takes them five minutes to tell who they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15234)|
| 4:13:57| and what their credentials are with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| Then we're going to try to get into something five minutes is not enough time for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15239)|
| 4:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15244)|
| 4:14:05| I'd agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15245)|
| 4:14:06| Well, let's let the sign industry have, I'll just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15246)|
| 4:14:16| we'll let them have enough time to introduce without putting a limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15256)|
| 4:14:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15260)|
| 4:14:21| It's probably good to give them, and then scenic Knoxville, whatever entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15261)|
| 4:14:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15264)|
| 4:14:25| Let them have equal amounts of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15265)|
| 4:14:28| I'd say ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15268)|
| 4:14:29| Ten minutes is a guideline to get them started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15269)|
| 4:14:32| And then if they go over some, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15272)|
| 4:14:35| But we start getting glassy-eyed after about ten minutes of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15275)|
| 4:14:39| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15279)|
| 4:14:40| If we get tired of listening, we get the hook, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15280)|
| 4:14:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15281)|
| 4:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15282)|
| 4:14:43| So we'll tell them about ten minutes, and then we'll start to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15283)|
| 4:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15289)|
| 4:14:50| Other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15290)|
| 4:14:51| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15291)|
| 4:14:52| Who's going to notify all the parties involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15292)|
| 4:14:56| We're going to publicly notice it through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15296)|
| 4:15:00| But the scenic, somebody's going to contact scenic Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15300)|
| 4:15:04| They're watching this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15304)|
| 4:15:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15306)|
| 4:15:07| Guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15307)|
| 4:15:08| They're watching this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15308)|
| 4:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15309)|
| 4:15:10| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15310)|
| 4:15:11| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15311)|
| 4:15:12| The sign folks, they're, I mean, everybody that wants to be here, they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15312)|
| 4:15:15| I'm not really, but what about on the 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15315)|
| 4:15:18| We're here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15318)|
| 4:15:20| 22nd for the second meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15320)|
| 4:15:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15322)|
| 4:15:23| We're here on a work session anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15323)|
| 4:15:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15324)|
| 4:15:25| And then we just do the second public hearing since we're all here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| and we've set aside that time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15329)|
| 4:15:30| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15330)|
| 4:15:31| Any objection to the 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15331)|
| 4:15:35| So the time would be when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15335)|
| 4:15:38| Best time would be following the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15338)|

| 4:16:03| Let's move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15363)|
| 4:16:04| That would be the 15th for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15364)|
| 4:16:06| No, that gets in the fall break, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15366)|
| 4:16:09| No, fall break is 18th, 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15369)|
| 4:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15373)|
| 4:16:14| How about 15th and the workshop, after the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15374)|
| 4:16:20| Yeah, I object because I don't think that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15380)|
| 4:16:22| we're going to meet on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15382)|
| 4:16:24| MPC is going to meet on the 11th to give us a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15384)|

| 4:16:46| Nobody is scheduling them for the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15406)|
| 4:16:48| On the 5th Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15408)|
| 4:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15409)|

| 4:16:51| The 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15411)|

| 4:16:54| Is that a night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15414)|
| 4:16:55| We're going to have a night meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| 5 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15417)|

| 4:17:14| 530 to 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15434)|
| 4:17:16| We're going to have a large assembly again unless otherwise noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15436)|
| 4:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15440)|
| 4:17:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15443)|
| 4:17:24| Is that all we need out of that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15444)|
| 4:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15448)|
| 4:17:29| On page 15, under other business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15449)|
| 4:17:32| discussion regarding the Knox County Ethics Committee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15452)|
| 4:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15458)|
| 4:17:41| Where are we on the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15461)|
| 4:17:46| We're against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15466)|
| 4:17:48| Mr. Hammond, do you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15468)|
| 4:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15474)|
| 4:17:55| That's been deferred for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15475)|
| 4:17:59| The resolution was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15479)|
| 4:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15483)|
| 4:18:05| Who brought the discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15485)|
| 4:18:07| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15487)|
| 4:18:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15490)|
| 4:18:13| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15493)|
| 4:18:18| I don't remember why we did that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15498)|
| 4:18:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15501)|
| 4:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15505)|
| 4:18:46| The esteemed Jolie Bonavita is going to tell me why I put that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15526)|
| 4:18:52| So go ahead and explain what we've got to do, Ms. Bonavita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15532)|
| 4:18:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15535)|
| 4:18:56| For the Ethics Committee appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| you have to have two public hearings for one public hearing in order to review resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15538)|
| 4:19:09| kind of like the application interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15549)|
| 4:19:12| And we have to send out a notice telling them when we're going to accept the resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15552)|
| 4:19:20| from, you know, up until what point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15560)|
| 4:19:22| and then what point we're going to do the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15562)|
| 4:19:26| Can I make a recommendation, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15566)|
| 4:19:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15568)|
| 4:19:29| Go right ahead, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15569)|
| 4:19:30| Do that before, you know, maybe one hour before the work session on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15570)|
| 4:19:35| Take the resumes up until then and do it one hour before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15575)|
| 4:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15579)|
| 4:19:40| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15580)|
| 4:19:41| Any objections to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15581)|
| 4:19:44| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| Yes, Mr. Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15586)|
| 4:19:47| I'd just like to point out that we're talking two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15587)|
| 4:19:50| This is the appointment from County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15590)|
| 4:19:52| We already have, like, 15 resumes in for the two terms that are winding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15592)|
| 4:20:00| Those are selected by the Ethics Committee themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15600)|
| 4:20:04| So I think the public, you know, we ought to look at all the resumes that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15604)|
| 4:20:10| and put another deadline on because we've got 15 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15610)|
| 4:20:13| and people won't understand the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15613)|
| 4:20:16| So just a caveat is all I'm putting forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15616)|
| 4:20:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15619)|
| 4:20:20| And this is a partial term of Mr. Lewis's that we're asking for, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15620)|
| 4:20:24| So we need to note that it's a partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15624)|
| 4:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15628)|
| 4:20:29| Do we – okay, are we set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15629)|
| 4:20:33| Is that – we've got the 15th at 1 and we've set when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15633)|
| 4:20:40| and we noticed when we'll accept resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15640)|
| 4:20:43| Limit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15645)|
| 4:20:47| Yes, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15647)|
| 4:20:49| You've got 15 for the open slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15649)|
| 4:20:54| Like Mr. Buick just said, how are they going to differentiate between who's on first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15654)|
| 4:20:58| and who's on second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15658)|
| 4:20:59| We're going to consider all of these for our slot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15659)|
| 4:21:02| We're talking about our representative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15662)|
| 4:21:04| It depends on when they pick those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15664)|
| 4:21:07| It could be one of those 15 or if it's one they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15667)|
| 4:21:13| Hey, I was confused about even putting it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15673)|
| 4:21:16| You're asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15676)|
| 4:21:18| Do we know when they pick theirs, Mr. Buick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15678)|
| 4:21:22| Do you know what meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15682)|
| 4:21:23| I think they were going to do the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15683)|
| 4:21:25| I think it's before the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15685)|
| 4:21:27| It's before the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15687)|
| 4:21:28| We can take their leftover resumes and the new ones that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15688)|
| 4:21:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15693)|
| 4:21:34| I think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15694)|
| 4:21:35| And Commissioner Brown makes a point because it gets so confusing because you've got that term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15695)|
| 4:21:40| that you've got to fill from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15700)|
| 4:21:42| But the public isn't going to know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15702)|
| 4:21:46| Who's on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15706)|
| 4:21:47| They want to be on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15707)|
| 4:21:50| But when we notice, we're going to notice our slot and that it's a partial term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15710)|
| 4:21:58| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15718)|
| 4:22:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15720)|
| 4:22:02| It's to complete the term of Mr. Lewis who's resigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15722)|
| 4:22:06| Okay, anything else we need on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15726)|
| 4:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15731)|
| 4:22:16| The next discussion item is discussion regarding committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15736)|
| 4:22:33| Okay, on the committee issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15753)|
| 4:22:39| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15759)|
| 4:22:40| We misstepped on a second and an approval of committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15760)|
| 4:22:49| First on the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15769)|
| 4:22:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15772)|
| 4:22:53| Mr. Buick, can you help me with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| I'm losing track on the committee issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15775)|
| 4:23:05| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15785)|
| 4:23:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15786)|
| 4:23:07| On agenda and the committee on committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15787)|
| 4:23:11| Mr. Anders noted that we had an improper second in the reorganization meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15791)|
| 4:23:18| and then we had an issue with the rules committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15798)|
| 4:23:23| So I think what we, in our discussion, what we really wanted to do was set a date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15803)|
| 4:23:36| for the rules committee, I mean, for the committee on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15816)|
| 4:23:40| and have some other discussion combined that not only cured those problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15820)|
| 4:23:47| but there were some other issues about committees that were either non-functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15827)|
| 4:23:54| or didn't meet or I wanted to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15834)|
| 4:23:59| Yes, Mr. Armstrong, help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15839)|
| 4:24:01| I can help you out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| The county commission asked the law department to make a recommendation on cable TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15843)|
| 4:24:09| was part of the things you were going to consider in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15849)|
| 4:24:14| whether we needed a committee on cable TV or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15854)|
| 4:24:17| And we have met and we do have a franchise here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15857)|
| 4:24:21| that is still standing as a county franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15861)|
| 4:24:25| And they recommended and we recommend as well that that cable TV committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15865)|
| 4:24:31| be sustained during this term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15871)|
| 4:24:34| because they're not planning on going for the state franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15874)|
| 4:24:37| And there's still a negotiation with the city for a new franchise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15877)|
| 4:24:42| and they're looking at Knox County also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15882)|
| 4:24:45| That was one of the reasons that you wanted the committee on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15885)|
| 4:24:48| to look at the committee for TV, cable television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15888)|
| 4:24:51| since it was left out in our reorganization meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15891)|
| 4:24:56| The other one was to cure some issues related to a couple of committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15896)|
| 4:25:04| that were done during the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15904)|
| 4:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15908)|
| 4:25:09| It helps you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15909)|
| 4:25:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15910)|
| 4:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15911)|
| 4:25:12| So first, let's just take one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15912)|
| 4:25:19| Committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15919)|
| 4:25:22| What's our problem with committee on committees from the reorganization meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15922)|
| 4:25:28| There was not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15928)|
| 4:25:29| Your committee on committees probably needs to meet to appoint the TV committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15929)|
| 4:25:36| the cable TV committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15936)|
| 4:25:37| or bring a recommendation before county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15937)|
| 4:25:40| since the organizational meeting has already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15940)|
| 4:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15943)|
| 4:25:44| We didn't have an answer for that at the time, so it was deferred basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15944)|
| 4:25:48| So you all need to meet and deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15948)|
| 4:25:51| And then you have these other committees that you need to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15951)|
| 4:25:54| Well, the committee on committees says not, does it have a chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15954)|
| 4:26:01| So the committee on committees has to meet to have a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15961)|
| 4:26:07| Go ahead, Ms. Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15967)|
| 4:26:09| But I remember from that day that you had asked for some of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15969)|
| 4:26:12| to serve on the committee on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15972)|
| 4:26:14| and those of us who were going to serve on it had asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15974)|
| 4:26:17| who wanted to serve on what committees before we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15977)|
| 4:26:20| and we kind of made a general decision that everybody pretty much wanted to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15980)|
| 4:26:25| on the committees they were on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15985)|
| 4:26:27| And so we just pretty much said, okay, well, everybody's going to keep doing the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15987)|
| 4:26:30| unless we need to make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15990)|
| 4:26:32| And there were a couple of little changes, and we affirmed that and moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15992)|
| 4:26:35| So that was kind of what happened that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15995)|
| 4:26:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15998)|
| 4:26:39| But committee on committees has got to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=15999)|
| 4:26:41| so how do we decide when they're going to meet, who's going to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16001)|
| 4:26:45| who's going to call the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16005)|
| 4:26:48| The chair would call the committee on committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16008)|
| 4:26:50| and the chair would call the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16010)|
| 4:26:51| We don't have a chair of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16011)|
| 4:26:53| No, the chair of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16013)|
| 4:26:54| The chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16014)|
| 4:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16015)|
| 4:26:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16016)|
| 4:26:57| So I'll call a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16017)|
| 4:27:00| Yeah, if you could just send us a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16020)|
| 4:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16022)|
| 4:27:03| I'll just send you some correspondence, email you when the committee on committees is going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16023)|
| 4:27:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16031)|
| 4:27:12| They'll solve that, then you all can take care of the cable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16032)|
| 4:27:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16035)|
| 4:27:16| Now to the rules committee issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16036)|
| 4:27:20| Mr. Armstrong, what did we do wrong there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16040)|
| 4:27:23| We had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16043)|
| 4:27:25| No, your second was good on the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16047)|
| 4:27:28| The other committee, I think your second was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16048)|
| 4:27:30| The second was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16050)|
| 4:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16051)|
| 4:27:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16053)|
| 4:27:34| So what else do we need to do on rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16054)|
| 4:27:37| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16057)|
| 4:27:38| Go ahead, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16058)|
| 4:27:40| The rules committee could have met at reorganization, but they did not choose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16060)|
| 4:27:46| So the rules committee really needs to get together and choose a chair because what was done in the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16066)|
| 4:27:51| was not noticed or a called meeting with no agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16071)|
| 4:27:54| I mean, the names are not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16074)|
| 4:27:56| It just, to be proper, you have to call a rules committee meeting to have selected a chair and a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16076)|
| 4:28:01| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16081)|
| 4:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16084)|
| 4:28:07| So do I need to call a rules committee meeting as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16087)|
| 4:28:11| Yeah, and I think what we've done in the past is just meet a few minutes before one of the main meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16091)|
| 4:28:18| I mean, we already got something on the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16098)|
| 4:28:21| so you may just want to call us a little bit maybe after the luncheon, no luncheon, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16101)|
| 4:28:26| somewhere around after beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16106)|
| 4:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16109)|
| 4:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16110)|
| 4:28:31| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16111)|
| 4:28:32| We'll have a rules committee meeting after beer board in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16112)|
| 4:28:39| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16119)|
| 4:28:40| Is that all right with these people on rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16120)|
| 4:28:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16124)|
| 4:28:45| Any other things in the committee process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16125)|
| 4:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16130)|
| 4:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16131)|
| 4:28:53| Discussion regarding RFP audit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16133)|
| 4:29:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16145)|
| 4:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16146)|
| 4:29:07| Discussion of the RFP being issued for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16147)|
| 4:29:13| For?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16153)|
| 4:29:14| Someone's going to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16154)|
| 4:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16155)|
| 4:29:16| This is as regards Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16156)|
| 4:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16159)|
| 4:29:20| And, Mr. Brown, why don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16160)|
| 4:29:22| You brought this up at the luncheon, so why don't you tee it up for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16162)|
| 4:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16167)|
| 4:29:28| Here's my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16168)|
| 4:29:31| It's been called to my attention, and while we didn't think about this from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16171)|
| 4:29:35| but when we talked about putting out the audit services on RFP, RFI, XYZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16175)|
| 4:29:47| whatever it is we do with them, Mr. Walls can submit a bid just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16187)|
| 4:29:56| Well, duh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16196)|
| 4:29:58| He's a county employee, so county employees cannot submit a bid to do business with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16198)|
| 4:30:05| So that precludes him from being able to, in effect, keep his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16205)|
| 4:30:13| for which, in my estimation, he's done a very good job with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16213)|
| 4:30:16| And I will say this while I have my little light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16216)|
| 4:30:20| that to me I feel like it is very important that the county auditor be a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16220)|
| 4:30:30| because that gives us more latitude, leeway, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16230)|
| 4:30:34| with the auditor services as far as what we want done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16234)|
| 4:30:40| That's one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16240)|
| 4:30:42| The second reason is that a county employee is more familiar with every department in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16242)|
| 4:30:49| and what some of their processes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16249)|
| 4:30:51| They don't have to relearn all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16251)|
| 4:30:54| I'm not saying accountants are dumb and they can't learn it, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16254)|
| 4:31:00| That's my take on this, and that's what I'll be voting on to keep our internal auditor as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16260)|
| 4:31:06| But my question in this case is, is Richard going to have to quit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16266)|
| 4:31:12| apply as an independent contractor to try to keep his job if he wants to bid on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16272)|
| 4:31:18| What's the story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16278)|
| 4:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16282)|
| 4:31:24| Mr. Reeves, you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16284)|
| 4:31:27| And I'm sorry, I'm going to have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16287)|
| 4:31:30| My church is having the first revival in 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16290)|
| 4:31:34| So I'm going to try not to miss too much of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16294)|
| 4:31:39| So Commissioner Smith will be taking over the chair from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16299)|
| 4:31:43| Thanks, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16303)|
| 4:31:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16308)|
| 4:31:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16310)|
| 4:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16313)|
| 4:31:54| Mike Reeves, Knox County Purchasing, 1000 North Central Street, Suite 100, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16314)|
| 4:32:02| Chairman Brown, the answer to your question is Richard Walls will not be submitting a formal bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16322)|
| 4:32:09| Our charge, what we've asked Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| We know what Mr. Walls, what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16332)|
| 4:32:15| We also know what Mr. Walls' budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16335)|
| 4:32:20| And that he, so he will not be actually issuing a formal bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16340)|
| 4:32:26| He will be participating should he wish to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16346)|
| 4:32:29| And he was encouraged during the discussions that we had in the previous audit committee meetings to participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16349)|
| 4:32:38| The question was, how was he going to participate in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16358)|
| 4:32:42| And I have discussed it with Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16362)|
| 4:32:44| And we feel the best way to do that is for him not to issue a formal bid because you are correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16364)|
| 4:32:51| a county employee cannot technically do a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16371)|
| 4:32:55| So he is not issuing a bid per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16375)|
| 4:32:58| But we will look at his, we certainly know what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16378)|
| 4:33:02| We will compare what he is, what he does in that department and against his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16382)|
| 4:33:10| And we were asked to basically, the charge was from the audit committee was to look at the potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16390)|
| 4:33:20| the possibilities of exploring outsourcing of the internal audit department to see what was simply out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16400)|
| 4:33:29| And so the last meeting that we had, the audit committee voted to issue an RFP for me to go ahead and proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16409)|
| 4:33:40| So that's what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16420)|
| 4:33:42| I've spoken to Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16422)|
| 4:33:45| And he is comfortable with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16425)|
| 4:33:48| And I would encourage Mr. Walls to participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16428)|
| 4:33:54| As I said the last time in the work session, we're just basically exploring to see what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16434)|
| 4:34:03| And that's, I think that's wise and efficient use of getting information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16443)|
| 4:34:12| We certainly know he does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16452)|
| 4:34:17| But, you know, that's what we've been asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16457)|
| 4:34:20| So I think we're within our bounds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16460)|
| 4:34:24| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16464)|
| 4:34:26| The RFP has already gone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16466)|
| 4:34:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16469)|
| 4:34:30| Or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16470)|
| 4:34:31| It's an RFP, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16471)|
| 4:34:32| And, yes, sir, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16472)|
| 4:34:33| It was issued in the paper on Sunday to be opened up on the 23rd of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16473)|
| 4:34:39| 23rd of October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16479)|
| 4:34:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16480)|
| 4:34:41| Who does those go to, the audit committee or they go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16481)|
| 4:34:43| They'll come direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16483)|
| 4:34:44| The process, sir, is that I am in charge of the process from womb to tomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16484)|
| 4:34:51| And they will come in to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16491)|
| 4:34:54| My job when they get there is to determine are the RFPs responsive and responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16494)|
| 4:35:02| Responsive meaning did they meet or exceed specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16502)|
| 4:35:05| Responsible meaning are they financially capable or providing said level of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16505)|
| 4:35:10| Once I make that determination, I will distribute those materials to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16510)|
| 4:35:16| The audit committee will be the evaluation team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16516)|
| 4:35:19| So it will be five members of the audit committee, including Dr. Carsello,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16519)|
| 4:35:25| should he be on the audit committee, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16525)|
| 4:35:32| And we will review those particular proposals along with looking at Mr. Wall's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16532)|
| 4:35:40| Everything in Mr. Wall's, one of the reasons why we did not want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16540)|
| 4:35:46| we wanted to proceed the way that we did is simply because we weren't sure in Mr. Wall's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16546)|
| 4:35:55| Now, I'm going to throw out a number, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16555)|
| 4:35:57| I think it was 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16557)|
| 4:35:58| How much is your budget, 250, 230?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16558)|
| 4:36:00| I believe it's 251.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16560)|
| 4:36:01| Okay, 251.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16561)|
| 4:36:03| We needed to determine within that 251 are benefits a part of that package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16563)|
| 4:36:08| and I have determined that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16568)|
| 4:36:10| So that is the full extent of the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16570)|
| 4:36:12| So to compare apples with apples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16572)|
| 4:36:14| we need to have looked at his full package when we look at somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16574)|
| 4:36:19| But we will look at his department against the proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16579)|
| 4:36:23| and make the determination of how much value his department represents to what proposals are submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16583)|
| 4:36:30| Well, I understand, and I agree with your process here, but I find one fault in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16590)|
| 4:36:38| and that is that you've got five companies out here that want to submit a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16598)|
| 4:36:43| They all now know what bid they've got to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16603)|
| 4:36:49| That's background information, public records, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16609)|
| 4:36:52| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16612)|
| 4:36:54| I mean, that's no other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16614)|
| 4:36:58| Commissioner, that's no different information than what we would give in any other bid that somebody would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16618)|
| 4:37:03| If they ask that information, we tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16623)|
| 4:37:06| I mean, if you were submitting a bid, sir, if you were submitting a bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16626)|
| 4:37:11| you would want to know the specifications and what's involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16631)|
| 4:37:16| One of the questions is going to be is how many different audits did Mr. Walls do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16636)|
| 4:37:22| And that information is in that RFP, and I'm giving them that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16642)|
| 4:37:26| I will give them everything they need to know in order to make a good business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16646)|
| 4:37:31| Yes, we have revealed the cards, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16651)|
| 4:37:35| that's public information that anybody could determine that information by simply going online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16655)|
| 4:37:42| and looking at Mr. Walls' budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16662)|
| 4:37:44| So I really don't think that's, in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16664)|
| 4:37:47| any more of an issue than it would be in any other process, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16667)|
| 4:37:51| And all due respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16671)|
| 4:37:54| You finished, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16674)|
| 4:37:56| Yeah, I'll quit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16676)|
| 4:37:57| And, Mike, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16677)|
| 4:37:58| There's some issues, but I don't want to divulge that because it's given them opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16678)|
| 4:38:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16682)|
| 4:38:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16684)|
| 4:38:06| You know, I'm actually okay with this process just to kind of figure out, you know, where we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16686)|
| 4:38:15| and to search the market and see what things are like out in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16695)|
| 4:38:20| But one thing, and I implore you since you own this process, is we can't un-pour this glass of milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16700)|
| 4:38:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16711)|
| 4:38:32| And once it's spilled, it's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16712)|
| 4:38:33| So we have something that's working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16713)|
| 4:38:37| One of the good things about having an in-house auditor is that they can turn on a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16717)|
| 4:38:42| I mean, you know, after these commission meetings, their directions change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16722)|
| 4:38:48| I mean, from 7 o'clock tonight, 8 o'clock the next morning, they're starting on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16728)|
| 4:38:52| Or after an audit committee, whatever the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16732)|
| 4:38:55| I'm not stepping on an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| But they can turn on a dime and start a new process and deliver a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16737)|
| 4:39:02| When you're going out there to bid, how can you ask that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| How can you, you know, the background, the this, the that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16745)|
| 4:39:09| And we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16749)|
| 4:39:10| We work and understand, and I know you do, but I don't know if auditors or audit firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16750)|
| 4:39:16| we work from third Monday to the third Monday, you know, fourth Monday to the fourth Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16756)|
| 4:39:22| And we want answers, and we want answers, you know, pretty immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16762)|
| 4:39:25| So, you know, we're a pretty tough customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16765)|
| 4:39:29| So when we talk about putting that out for bid, how do you describe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16769)|
| 4:39:34| How do you evaluate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16774)|
| 4:39:36| How do you give that a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16776)|
| 4:39:38| And then how do you compare that number to the current internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16778)|
| 4:39:43| You know, that's, you know, we've gotten into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16783)|
| 4:39:47| I know this administration has gone to these defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16787)|
| 4:39:51| They've saved the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16791)|
| 4:39:52| We're saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16792)|
| 4:39:53| You know, all babies are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16793)|
| 4:39:56| All that, you know, apple pie stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16796)|
| 4:40:00| But sometimes some things need to remain a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16800)|
| 4:40:08| Yeah, there's a cost to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16808)|
| 4:40:09| It's a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16809)|
| 4:40:10| But is it worth it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16810)|
| 4:40:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16811)|
| 4:40:12| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16812)|
| 4:40:13| Again, I'm okay with you going through the process, but somehow in the end you can't come out and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16813)|
| 4:40:19| well, ooh, this other one came in at $135,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16819)|
| 4:40:23| We're going to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16823)|
| 4:40:25| We're going to save the county $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16825)|
| 4:40:29| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16829)|
| 4:40:30| Oh, well, the last year Richard Walz and his folks have audited eight things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16830)|
| 4:40:38| The next year it might be 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16838)|
| 4:40:40| So, again, to put a value on that is, again, that's your charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16840)|
| 4:40:47| But I do want, you know, I do think the internal auditors was created by this body to serve our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16847)|
| 4:40:56| And I'm going to be quiet and give you an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16856)|
| 4:40:59| But I just want to send a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16859)|
| 4:41:02| And hopefully you don't take it as a threat because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16862)|
| 4:41:04| I just want to send a charge out there to say, let's make sure we're understanding what we're evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16864)|
| 4:41:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16874)|
| 4:41:15| Thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16875)|
| 4:41:16| And we certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16876)|
| 4:41:18| Please understand I'm just one of six possible votes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16878)|
| 4:41:23| And we certainly will look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16883)|
| 4:41:25| I will tell you, sir, that the cost component is, I believe, only 20 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16885)|
| 4:41:31| So 80% of the process, the evaluation process, is based on other components that we certainly have the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16891)|
| 4:41:43| for example, qualifications and experience and the professional staff assigned to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16903)|
| 4:41:50| And, you know, Mr. Walls obviously has an advantage in that he knows the processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16910)|
| 4:42:00| and he is available at the disposal of the audit committee like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16920)|
| 4:42:06| So we will certainly look at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16926)|
| 4:42:10| I think we have a wonderful audit committee staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16930)|
| 4:42:14| And they are very qualified, including the commissioners that sit on it, to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16934)|
| 4:42:21| I feel very comfortable with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16941)|
| 4:42:24| I think you can look at our external auditing process that we have in place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16944)|
| 4:42:29| and feel very comfortable that we do dot every I and cross every T, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16949)|
| 4:42:36| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16956)|
| 4:42:37| Have a good audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16957)|
| 4:42:38| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16958)|
| 4:42:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16959)|
| 4:42:40| Thanks, Mike, for the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16960)|
| 4:42:41| And I think you've done a great job putting this RFP together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16961)|
| 4:42:46| It's got to be sort of awkward because, to me, it's a different animal than what we traditionally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16966)|
| 4:42:50| And this didn't originate in the mayor's office, although we have a mayor who likes to save money and be efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16970)|
| 4:42:57| which we all should be, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16977)|
| 4:42:59| It originated from our chair, Joe Garcello, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16979)|
| 4:43:03| And when I first heard it, I thought, that's a little odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| And then the more I thought about it, I thought, well, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16985)|
| 4:43:07| You know, it's just an attempt to see if we can improve the efficiency of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16987)|
| 4:43:12| In this place, it's a microcosm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16992)|
| 4:43:14| I guess it's just the audit function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16994)|
| 4:43:17| And we may be in the audit committee as evaluators and whoever else is on it may come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=16997)|
| 4:43:24| We may say, gosh, Richard's doing the best job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17004)|
| 4:43:26| No way are we going to replace him for $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17006)|
| 4:43:30| Or we may say, well, gosh, we might can do better than this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17010)|
| 4:43:33| And there's two or three firewalls if the commission doesn't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17013)|
| 4:43:37| It's got to be approved by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17017)|
| 4:43:40| And then the commissions can vote it down, what, eight to three, I guess, assuming we three support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17020)|
| 4:43:49| Or eight to two, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17029)|
| 4:43:51| I guess it will be a majority of the evaluators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17031)|
| 4:43:53| But nevertheless, there are some firewalls there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17033)|
| 4:43:56| It's not a done deal by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17036)|
| 4:43:58| And I certainly will give great credibility and influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17038)|
| 4:44:04| That's not the right word I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17044)|
| 4:44:07| Weight, weight to Richard's background and to what he has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17047)|
| 4:44:12| And there is an advantage to having people internal doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17052)|
| 4:44:16| They do know what's going on and what the chitchat is and what the rumors are and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17056)|
| 4:44:21| So there's some validity to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17061)|
| 4:44:24| We just thought it was a way to possibly improve the audit function for the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17064)|
| 4:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17070)|
| 4:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17071)|
| 4:44:32| Commissioner Hammond, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17072)|
| 4:44:33| Commissioner Brown, is that your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17073)|
| 4:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17076)|
| 4:44:38| I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17078)|
| 4:44:39| I just want to encourage the evaluators not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17079)|
| 4:44:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17085)|
| 4:44:47| Law Director, you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| I just wanted to let the commission know, and I think that Commissioner Shouse basically stated what I was fixing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17089)|
| 4:44:56| This RFP can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17096)|
| 4:44:58| The audit committee can vote whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17098)|
| 4:45:01| The internal auditor is created by this commission and can only be dissolved by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17101)|
| 4:45:06| In fact, you could end up with two running parallel if this body decides not to, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17106)|
| 4:45:12| terminate the audit internal auditor as a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17112)|
| 4:45:16| So this is a beginning of a process, and everything in the end will end up right here, as Commissioner Shouse has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17116)|
| 4:45:23| for you all to vote up or down on in terms of even having an internal auditor or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17123)|
| 4:45:29| But this is the only place that Mr. Walz's job or committee can be dissolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17129)|
| 4:45:36| So I just wanted to get that clear on the table that the final decision, whatever the RFP results in, will rest here with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17136)|
| 4:45:45| No, I need to speak on one other item before we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17145)|
| 4:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17148)|
| 4:45:49| Yeah, we've got two others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17149)|
| 4:45:50| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17150)|
| 4:45:51| Yeah, let me just say to you, Commissioner Brown, I assure you that we will make sure the process is done correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17151)|
| 4:46:04| and fairly and we will not throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17164)|
| 4:46:10| I am very, very careful to control processes and make sure everybody understands what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17170)|
| 4:46:16| And I believe we'll get to a process, to a finality that everyone will be pleased with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17176)|
| 4:46:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17182)|
| 4:46:23| I know you are, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17183)|
| 4:46:24| And I appreciate the work you've done for the county for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17184)|
| 4:46:29| I wasn't inferring anything other than the fact that we really need to look at this as a special case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17189)|
| 4:46:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17201)|
| 4:46:42| And thank you for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17202)|
| 4:46:43| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17203)|
| 4:46:44| Can I just say that I'm glad no babies are being harmed in the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17204)|
| 4:46:58| Next item, discussion on the peddler's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17218)|
| 4:47:01| Roy, if you'd want to come forward and talk to us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17221)|
| 4:47:06| Is anybody from the Sheriff's Department with you, Roy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17226)|
| 4:47:09| It's just me alone, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17229)|
| 4:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17231)|
| 4:47:12| Roy Braden, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17232)|
| 4:47:14| I'll start off with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17234)|
| 4:47:16| Commissioner Smith had talked to me about this numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17236)|
| 4:47:21| about the people running under a lot of different definitions, flea markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17241)|
| 4:47:26| or what we had found is under businesses in Chapter 12 of the codification is transit vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17246)|
| 4:47:35| But after reading it more thoroughly, I found that it only has to do with new merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17255)|
| 4:47:42| So I guess a flea market or whatever it is would not be considered under this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17262)|
| 4:47:50| unless someone liked to change the language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17270)|
| 4:47:53| But flea market in the zoning ordinance talks about the occasional or periodic sale held in an open area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17273)|
| 4:48:01| where groups of individual sellers offer goods for sale to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17281)|
| 4:48:05| and the sale goods are moved off the premise between sale dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17285)|
| 4:48:10| I know that HAWS and POW has a lot of, well, whatever they are, flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17290)|
| 4:48:18| But in our zoning ordinance, they are allowed in a CA, CB, and CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17298)|
| 4:48:24| And that was approved in 1992 with an ordinance at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17304)|
| 4:48:29| But that's pretty much besides the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17309)|
| 4:48:32| And to say that it's allowed, that's all that's in the zoning ordinance about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17312)|
| 4:48:36| is the definition and it's allowed in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17316)|
| 4:48:38| So when my code enforcement officers go out and inspect these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17318)|
| 4:48:42| they're actually allowed in the sense that we don't have any language that tells us that it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17322)|
| 4:48:48| other than they're actually in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17328)|
| 4:48:50| So what I would suggest or respectfully ask the commission is I think that a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17330)|
| 4:48:58| when someone tried to write an ordinance on flea market, MPC wrote it, brought it before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17338)|
| 4:49:07| But it was like to say, we're going to have a flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17347)|
| 4:49:10| You have to have five acres to do it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17350)|
| 4:49:13| That would be setting one up legally, which was a good ordinance if that's what the objective was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17353)|
| 4:49:19| But I think the objective here is to regulate these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17359)|
| 4:49:23| And under the business ordinance, if this transit vendor also led to the sale of used goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17363)|
| 4:49:31| then it would be appropriate to require them to have a permit and to be monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17371)|
| 4:49:37| Because I'm sure no one has a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17377)|
| 4:49:40| And I'm sure county business taxes aren't being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17380)|
| 4:49:44| So I would suggest that we need to do something to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17384)|
| 4:49:49| We'd need the law department and MPC to work with us on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17389)|
| 4:49:52| That's what I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17392)|
| 4:49:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17395)|
| 4:49:56| And I'll jump to Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17396)|
| 4:49:58| Yeah, Roy, you were referring to Powell and Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17398)|
| 4:50:01| And I was the one that tried to get that ordinance passed because of what's going on in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17401)|
| 4:50:06| There's a gentleman that there's two or three people that set up on the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17406)|
| 4:50:12| but they generally set up on a Friday night or Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17412)|
| 4:50:15| One guy in particular sells fishing parts, fishing rods and lures and things that he gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17415)|
| 4:50:22| He repairs them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17422)|
| 4:50:23| He gets them new, repairs them, and sells them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17423)|
| 4:50:25| The dealerships can't sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17425)|
| 4:50:27| And he's quite a business, but it creates a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17427)|
| 4:50:31| And the sheriff's office tries to help us out with that quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17431)|
| 4:50:34| They're back on the old Engels on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17434)|
| 4:50:39| They're setting up their 30 or 15 or 20 vendors are setting up on Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17439)|
| 4:50:45| And so it's blight more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17445)|
| 4:50:49| It's unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17449)|
| 4:50:50| The guy on the side of the road is unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17450)|
| 4:50:51| And I know you guys don't work usually on Saturdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17451)|
| 4:50:54| but if there's some Saturday enforcement, if they're out and about and they have some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17454)|
| 4:50:59| I'd appreciate them to come up Clinton Highway on a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17459)|
| 4:51:02| See, Commissioner, the problem is their zoning ordinance doesn't say that that's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17462)|
| 4:51:06| That's the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17466)|
| 4:51:08| Now, I think the sheriff did tell me that he does try to help when they are in the road right-of-way and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17468)|
| 4:51:15| But can this guy set up for business on the side of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17475)|
| 4:51:19| We don't have anything in the zoning ordinance that says that it's illegal in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17479)|
| 4:51:24| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17484)|
| 4:51:26| He's on the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17486)|
| 4:51:27| That would be another legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17487)|
| 4:51:30| There's no zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17490)|
| 4:51:31| It's just a right-of-way trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17491)|
| 4:51:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17492)|
| 4:51:33| But, see, it goes back for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17493)|
| 4:51:35| It's not a codes enforcement issue because there's no language in here that gives us the authority to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17495)|
| 4:51:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17502)|
| 4:51:43| We'll try to get you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17503)|
| 4:51:44| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17504)|
| 4:51:45| I agree with those comments that you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17505)|
| 4:51:46| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17506)|
| 4:51:47| I was going to say, so I could set up on the side of the road and basically sell whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17507)|
| 4:51:51| and it's not a violation of the zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17511)|
| 4:51:53| I mean, you couldn't arrest me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17513)|
| 4:51:55| I don't think I have any language in the zoning ordinance that gives us direction to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17515)|
| 4:52:01| And that's what I was saying Commissioner Anders tried a year or so ago to get the ordinance written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17521)|
| 4:52:07| but it was not written for the proper objective is to control these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17527)|
| 4:52:13| And when we found this, if this said used materials, then this would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17533)|
| 4:52:19| They would only be able to get a permit for 30 days at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17539)|
| 4:52:23| The clerk sells the permit and then the clerk or the sheriff's department can enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17543)|
| 4:52:29| If it was rewritten in such a way, our people, we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17549)|
| 4:52:34| The codes enforcement officers could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17554)|
| 4:52:36| But it would be nice to have it written in there that it would be a function of codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17556)|
| 4:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17562)|
| 4:52:43| Because I think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17563)|
| 4:52:44| There's a guy that sells steaks there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| I pass him all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17566)|
| 4:52:48| And so, I mean, it would be nice if we made sure that these people were properly permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17568)|
| 4:52:53| because if they're making money, they should be paying taxes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17573)|
| 4:52:57| So that's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17577)|
| 4:52:59| And there are several people who set up on the side of the road on Chapman Highway, particularly on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17579)|
| 4:53:05| There's some vacant lots and so forth out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17585)|
| 4:53:07| So you're saying if we redo the ordinance that there could be some enforcement to make sure at least they're getting permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17587)|
| 4:53:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17593)|
| 4:53:14| Commissioner, I want to reiterate that if with the lures that's being sold as new, that would fall under this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17594)|
| 4:53:23| And if they're selling steaks, I would think it would fall under this section because it would be new merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17603)|
| 4:53:32| But, I mean, bottom line is, is that we don't have the manpower to go all over Knox County to try to find somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17612)|
| 4:53:37| that's just set up selling trinkets or rugs or whatever it is that they're trying to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17617)|
| 4:53:42| Sunglasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17622)|
| 4:53:43| I mean, I see those on John Severe Highway quite a bit, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17623)|
| 4:53:46| And I'd like to ask for a few thousand more dollars to hire somebody for the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17626)|
| 4:53:53| Well, you bring up a good point that, you know, there could be a lot of work, especially in the spring and the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17633)|
| 4:53:59| What we have found in our area is that it's vacant absentee landlords where the people are moving in and taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17639)|
| 4:54:07| There was a big story in Channel 10 about three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17647)|
| 4:54:09| They just overtook a parking lot hillside and going to restrooms and other people's businesses and just, you know, being abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17649)|
| 4:54:16| But we may have to have some codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17656)|
| 4:54:18| People work like a half a day on Saturday just to get the message out a little bit on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17658)|
| 4:54:24| Law Director, do you want to weigh in on this on the yard sales, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17664)|
| 4:54:28| Yeah, I'm just curious, Roy, on your codes and to what extent are you wanting this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17668)|
| 4:54:34| I understand what you're asking, but to narrow it down to where are you wanting to eliminate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17674)|
| 4:54:40| personal yard sales and subdivisions and that kind of thing, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17680)|
| 4:54:45| I'm trying to get where you're at on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17685)|
| 4:54:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17687)|
| 4:54:48| The yard sales are allowed three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17688)|
| 4:54:51| Also, there's another section, rummage sales, which would be a church or any other civic organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17691)|
| 4:54:59| They can have those two times a year by the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17699)|
| 4:55:02| So we're not trying to limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17702)|
| 4:55:03| You're not asking for a change in any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17703)|
| 4:55:06| No, I would think this would be basically off of the person's personal property where people are setting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17706)|
| 4:55:12| And under this law here in Chapter 12 under businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17712)|
| 4:55:17| there's a section where it talks about the owner of the property can request that the person selling leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17717)|
| 4:55:24| and they have to leave immediately or they're in violation of this section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17724)|
| 4:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17729)|
| 4:55:30| Mr. Law Director, can you bring us a resolution then next month's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17730)|
| 4:55:34| We can put you one together, work with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17734)|
| 4:55:36| This is zoning or is this the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17736)|
| 4:55:38| Well, it's either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17738)|
| 4:55:40| However, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17740)|
| 4:55:41| But I think an ordinance change to either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17741)|
| 4:55:44| it would take a zoning ordinance change or a business section ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17744)|
| 4:55:49| We'll get with Roy and MPC and we'll get you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17749)|
| 4:55:51| And it wouldn't hurt to reiterate that about the yard sales because that will come up that that's allowed three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17751)|
| 4:55:57| I had forgotten that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17757)|
| 4:55:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17759)|
| 4:56:00| Discussion regarding salary freezes has been withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17760)|
