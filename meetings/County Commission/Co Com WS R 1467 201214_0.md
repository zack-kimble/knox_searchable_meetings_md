| 0:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| The agenda is now set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| We will move on to the first part of our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| The list I have been given includes 24 names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| One will be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| That will be Mr. Jeff Bagwell, who will do a monthly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| So, as before, what we'll do is sort of run down the first five in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| The IT team has the same number, same list, so they will go through that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| And the first – I'll list off the first five names in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| It will be Grant King, Ashley Smith, Vernon Henry, and William Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| That will be our first – that will be our first four, and then Robert Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| So, that will be our first five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| So, we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Three-minute timer is up, and our first guest is Grant King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| I'd like to see – do we have a visual on Grant King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Can you see me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Grant King, thank you for coming to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| You have – please state your name and your county of residence for the record, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| My name is Grant King, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| I live in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| And I'm speaking to express my belief that the Knox County Board of Health has essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| outlived its useful purpose in light of the manner in which they have handled the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| with the coronavirus that the health board needs to be disbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Now, many have opined that the Board of Health has been acting responsibility, and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| members themselves have stated they are following the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| I would make the case that they are neither being responsible nor are they following science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| They are simply following politically motivated protocols established by the CDC, NIH, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| other government agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| The mandates they have set forth are nothing more than repackaging of these protocols – masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| social distancing, limiting the size of gatherings, curfews on bars and restaurants, and limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| their capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| There is absolutely no science that gives even an indication that any of these measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| have any effect whatsoever on the spread of COVID-19 or any respiratory virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Respiratory viruses, once they are in the population, they are going to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| And we're way beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| And there are many doctors, epidemiologists, and research scientists who all along were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| saying that masks, social distancing, and lockdowns were the exact opposite thing we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| needed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Recently, there was an article by Dr. Russell Blalock where he wrote that wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| is actually harmful to the wearer and makes them even more susceptible to infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| So many voices were saying we need to protect the vulnerable and then allow the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| us to develop herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Well, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| At the end of July, when the mask mandate was issued by the health board, we had crossed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| the threshold of 2,000 positive cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Today, that number is over 25,000 – more than two and a half times as high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| So one of the definitions of insanity is performing the same actions, expecting a different result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| We've tried the masks, social distancing, limits on gatherings and curfews, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| And yet that seems to be the only thing our health board has to offer – regurgitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| protocols from the CDC and NIH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Now one thing that was stated from the beginning was that if a person was healthy and had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| strong immune system, they would probably get through the disease fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Why wasn't our health board talking about immune health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| There are many things that individuals can do to increase their immune health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| There's vitamin supplements, there's exercise, developing good lifestyle habits, good eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| I hate to go here, but lose weight and I'll say myself, I've dropped 20 pounds over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| the summer myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| But no, we didn't hear any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| All we were hearing was masks, social distance, limit gatherings and curfews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| The fact is, we didn't need the board of health for any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| We could have just listened to Dr. Anthony Fauci and saved ourselves the trouble, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=782)|

| 0:20:55| with me, and others would choose to sit downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| My businesses represent a large cross-section of town, and the businesses that I manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| have infused this county over the last few years with tens of millions of dollars of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| taxable purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I also mentor hundreds of other business owners locally, and collectively, we bring millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| of dollars of income home each year to spend within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| And I say that because I don't think you always understand who's supporting you and cheering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Many of us are the actual voices you want representing you during seasons of election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| and I would encourage you each to not mute us or turn us away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| Others tonight are probably going to speak more eloquently about mask usage and curfew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| concerns and social distancing and all manner of things, but I want to take a moment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| remind you of the promises you made individually to those who elected you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1300)|

| 0:21:54| People whose jobs are on the line, whose businesses are suffering, servers and hostesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| whose restaurants are closing their doors to the public, these are the people to whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| you owe a great deal of appreciation and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Now, I've had the privilege to attend nearly all of the public commissioner meetings over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| the last five or so months, and I will be the first to admit that prior to this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| I had no idea what the commissioner position entailed, but it has been really fascinating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| to learn more and see each of you in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| I believe that each of you has wrestled with these decisions, you've spoken with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| that you respect and admire, and many of you are torn on these issues, and I want to pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| and acknowledge that out of respect for what you've done for our county, and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| I also believe that each one of you chose to run for your position because you genuinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| care about our community and your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| I know when you were elected or reelected in the last few years, you probably assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| the issues that you faced would be mundane and typical, and instead, you're on this bizarre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| roller coaster ride of chaos, and you're being forced to give opinions about things you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| never considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| The weight on your shoulders is heavy and vast, but with all of that, I want to respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| say it is time for you to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| It's time for you to recognize that the decisions you have the opportunity to make are decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| about our liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Each of you were elected for your opinion, and over the past few months, we've watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| you quietly sidestep those elected responsibilities and hand them over to an unelected board with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| their own agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| They are making decisions about masks and curfews and social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| Tomorrow, will they be deciding on forced vaccinations or handgun laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| To quote Larson Jay from October, there is nothing more important than earning and maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| the public's trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| You, our elected officials, earned our trust when you received our votes, but now you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| given your power over to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| We are the ones who cast the ballots to put you in office, and we are ashamed, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| will not maintain our trust, as he said, by handing it to an unelected health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| If you agree with the vote, I will wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| I have not spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I'd love to finish my statement if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Okay, but we have a three-minute time limit for everybody, so we need to repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I prepared for five, as I was told in advance that I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| If I could be so bold, I will just say we are all paying closer attention than ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| to these district lines, and we know who our commissioners are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| We know where we live and which seats will be up in the next election cycle, and many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| of us have been unafraid to speak how we feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And some of us who are watching right now look forward to the opportunity to challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| you at the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| So you've been given an opportunity to represent your district, and if you're unwilling to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| do so, there are those of us who will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you for your time, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1482)|

| 0:24:47| I would like to just remind all the rest of our speakers, we would love to hear you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| but we have set a three-minute time limit that everybody's agreed to, and we would respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| that everybody respect the other speakers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I'm going to go back to Mr. Robert Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Are you ready to go with us, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Hopefully, I think we'll come to technical difficulties now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Mr. Thomas, would you please state your name and your county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| My name is Robert Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| I'm represented by Commissioners Biggs, Buehler, and, of course, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I want to thank the people of Knox County for giving me this public forum to speak in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| and for sitting these commissioners in this public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| It is, after all, the forum belonging to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I would ask to speak to the commissioners this evening about the agenda item number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| 40 that is a resolution to further limit the number of people who can call an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Currently, it's two, that being the mayor and the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| This is limited, of course, to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I ask you to vote no on this rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| The reason for that is, chiefly, number one, that it's a consolidation of power, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| against that in any form inside the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| But number two, I would ask you to vote against it because I have no confidence in the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| I've been watching the county commission meetings from my home over the past couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| of months, mostly, and while it hasn't been any award-winning television, what it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| been is shocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| There has been a very clear and consistent message coming out of the commission chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| and that is that you do not want to hear from the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Whether it's shouting, you people need to be quiet at the balcony, or whether it's declaring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| that it is a privilege, not a right, to speak to the county commission, whether it's trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| to limit the public forum, whatever avenue it comes in, even to the point of a young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| woman in her 20s standing down on the commission floor, holding up a copy of the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| and for three and a half minutes to five minutes, she has to speak to you, the chair turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| and carrying on a conversation with the clerk and playing with a three-ring binder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| In all of these instances, the message has been very, very clear, that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| chair does not have the time to listen to what the county has to say, even to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| of being rude and just flat-out disingenuous with the other commissioner and his conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| So I ask you to vote no, and I would also like to speak to Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| Sir, you don't represent me, but I want to say thank you to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1644)|

| 0:27:34| I want to thank you for standing up for the Constitution of this state and for our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| And sir, I can't vote for you, but I can't answer phones or go door-to-door, so the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| time you decide to run for anything, even if it's Dogcatcher in Roan County, I'll shoot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| you an email, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| You let me know where to be, when to be there, and I'll be glad to support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Commissioners Biggs, Commissioners Beeler, I hope that you'll support Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| and his resolution, agenda item number 41 tonight, and that way I can support you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1682)|

| 0:29:06| If you would unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| And Sherry, you have your name and your county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Rebecca is ready to hop back in in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I live in Knox County in Commissioner Boesler's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| I want to read to you something written by C.S. Lewis years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| It's called Living in an Atomic Age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| In one way, we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| How are we to live in an atomic age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| I am tempted to reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Why as you have lived in the 16th century when the plague visited London almost every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| and cut your throat at night, or indeed as you already living in an age of cancer, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| an age of motor accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation, even our situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love are already sentenced to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| before the atomic bomb was invented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb, when it comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| find us doing sensible and human things, praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of dart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs or COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| They may break our bodies, a microbe can do that, but they need not dominate our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| What the atomic bomb has really done is to remind us forcibly that this sort of world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| we are living in and which, during the prosperous period before, we were beginning to forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| And this reminder is, so far as it goes, a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| We have been waked from a pretty dream, and now we can begin to talk about realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| It is our business to live by our own law and not by fears, to follow, in private or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| in public life, the law of love and temperance, even when they seem to be suicidal, and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| the law of competition and grab, even when they seem to be necessary to our own survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| For it is part of our spiritual law never to put survival first, not even the survival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| of our species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| We must resolutely train ourselves to feel that the survival of man on this earth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| much more of our own nation or culture or class is not worth having unless it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| had by honorable and merciful means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Nothing is more likely to destroy a species or a nation than a determination to survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Those who care for something else more than civilization are the only people by whom civilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| is at all likely to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Those who want heaven must have served earth best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Those who love man less than God do most for man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| Let the bomb, let COVID-19 find you doing well, because it's certainly going to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| me doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1943)|

| 0:32:27| Our next speaker, we'll go back in the list to Rebecca Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| Is Rebecca Reeves there in the same feed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1953)|

| 0:32:42| Can you take me off the phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Rebecca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Can I speak from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Rebecca Reeves, if you would, please state your name and your county of residence and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| My name is Rebecca Reeves and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I want to start by talking about, we've all heard the fable about boiling a frog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| If you put the frog in a pot of boiling water, it will jump out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| If you put the frog in cold water and slowly turn the temperature up, slowly, a few degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| at a time, the frog will slowly acclimate to the temperature as it rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| But by the time the water gets to boiling, the frog has acclimated and used up all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| its energy and is too weak to jump out of the boiling water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| So the frog will sit there in that boiling water and not jump out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I'm going to get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| The other day, an airline yet again kicked off another family because their two-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| would not keep her mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| The parents tried to comply and tried to put the mask on her, but the toddler was not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| it that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| So the father put his daughter in his lap and cradled her and kept her in his arms covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| her face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| They still kicked the family off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| The child's face was literally covered by the dad, but it wasn't good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| It wasn't a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| This family had to leave while their belongings, including the child's car seat, were flown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| to their destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Not one citizen on that plane stood up and defended that family or that little child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| This time last year, if we saw a family being kicked off of an airplane because a two-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| couldn't cover her mouth and nose, we would stand up and scream, abuse, get your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| off that child's face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| But now, because we have turned the temperature up just a little at a time, we have acclimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| and exhausted our energy while the Constitution, our freedoms, and our rights have slowly been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| taken away from us, one degree at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| And we find ourselves in a pot of boiling water, surrounded by citizens who are acclimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| and too weak to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I'll tell you one thing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| You will never catch me in that pot of boiling water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| There's many of us who know exactly what happens in that pot of boiling water, which is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| why we have a Constitution and is exactly why we don't allow you to take away one piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| of it, one degree, no matter how small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| It's just a piece of cloth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| It's just a curfew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| It's just to keep you safe, and it's just this and it's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| It's just one more degree, just one more degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| You slowly take it away until we find ourselves in a pot of boiling water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| A friend of mine who had a child who was always sick was always at the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| The doctor finally asked, are you overusing hand sanitizer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Are you a clean freak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| And my friend said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| She keeps her kid away from public, doesn't know why she keeps getting her sick, uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| hand sanitizer every second she can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| The doctor said, you're the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| You're the reason your child is so sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| You won't give her immune system a chance to build, so every germ has a free entryway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| with no line of defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2124)|

| 0:35:28| The Board of Health should be concerned with making us stronger, not weaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| And of course, COVID hits like Mike Tyson when you are weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| Would you get in the boxing ring without working out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2135)|

| 0:36:02| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2162)|

| 0:36:14| I have lived here in this county until this pandemic hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| When all of this first started, I was scared, watching all of the mainstream media reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| and the press briefings, hearing death rates of 10% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| So I, like many others, I listened to the two weeks to slow the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Myself and my daughter, we stayed home, we sanitized everything and lived in fear for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| almost a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Then I started to do more research and more things started to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Many articles on masks being ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Many articles of lockdowns being ineffective, curfews, closures of only certain small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| being ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I watched an unelected board become a legislative board with the power to mandate and give jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| time and pull business licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| I watched the same unconstitutional boards spread fear and hate throughout our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| pinning neighbor upon neighbor and neighbor upon business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| People tattling on one another, people for not following mandates and asking how to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| All of what I have witnessed makes me sick and very disheartened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Everyone has lost their critical thinking skills and their empathy for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Please dissolve this unelected board, the health board and give them advisory role only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| We are all adults and we are capable of making the best decisions we can for ourselves and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2251)|

| 0:37:41| They're afraid to be silenced like so many of the other medical professionals that speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| out with a different opinion or view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Afraid to be shamed, afraid to lose their jobs or business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| This is no way to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| And of course, we don't want anyone to die, but at what point do we start worrying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| quality of life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2277)|

| 0:39:23| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2363)|

| 0:39:28| Commissioners, first I'd like to thank you for allowing me to speak on the issue I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| speaking on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I'm coming to you as a concerned citizen and a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| The mandate that the Board of Health has in place is hurting small businesses and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Knox County economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| I'm afraid that if this Board of Health is kept in the position that they are in, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| we will see the economy drop even more as more businesses lay off more employees or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| shut their doors completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Since these mandates have gone into place, I have seen many people struggling to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| ends meet because their hours were cut or they were laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| I know people that now have to work three jobs just to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| This means they don't get to see their family at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| If the Board of Health is left in the position of an unconstitutional mandate in place, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| will see the small businesses shutting their doors and more county residents losing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| Please take the power away from the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Thank you, Ms. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2430)|

| 0:40:43| Mr. Hill, if you would please state your name, your county of residence, and you have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| My name is Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| First I'd like to invite, we have a large group gathered with us at the press room on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2455)|

| 0:41:08| We'll be beginning at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| It's a prayer service, so we are in compliance with the current mandate that has been unconstitutionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| thrust upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| It is sponsored by a church, and yes, we do pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| We pray for this commission to make a right and wise decision for the well-being of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2480)|

| 0:41:26| So I just wanted to make sure everybody was aware of that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2486)|

| 0:41:35| for the prayer service to begin before the county commission meets and then to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| during and to gather with your fellow citizens in defiance of the authoritarian state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| is manifesting in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Now in my remaining two minutes, let's talk about some serious things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Several months ago when I came before you, I said, we have a county board of health that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| is acting in a way that I did not think that they themselves were communist agitators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| but that they were in compliance with a system that is being manipulated by such persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| We now know that there were just recently dissidents out of China through Singapore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| have released a report the first time in history of over 8,000 communist agitators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| who are embedded all through the West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| And many of them are in high levels of leadership at drug companies like Pfizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| So we have a very controlled entity in our public health sector that is being driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| by a very manipulated, very manipulated drug industry that we can't trust anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| That we have enemies of our state embedded in their governance, giving leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| And oh, by the way, we also know that Eric Swalwell, a representative on the intelligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| committee in the house of representatives was completely funded and supported and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| into Congress by the support of a communist spy that had to flee the country because she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| was discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| So it is not insanity and it is not incredulous to say that boards are the useful idiots using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| the proper technical language of the communist infiltration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| They are simply taking marching orders from larger entities that have been infiltrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2603)|

| 0:48:18| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| And I understand what Ms. Feinbaum is saying and having elderly relatives, and you're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2907)|

| 0:48:40| And so that was kind of the thing that we struggled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| He did not die of COVID, but if I could give Ms. Aaron a high five live, I would have earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2924)|
| 0:48:55| But I guess my question to you all is really, I guess it's been echoed before too, the constitutionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| of it, but really just comes down to common sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| We elected you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2946)|

| 0:49:21| You campaigned for our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2961)|

| 0:49:28| And so the question for us is, in Knox County, Tennessee, in the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| why are we bowing down and having to suffer under the rules and dictation of an unelected body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2973)|
| 0:49:43| Who gave them the authority to tell us how not to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| We all have decisions to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| If a business decides to stay open, it is the decision of the customers whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| go do business with that business or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| If someone knows the risks, I get that the Board of Health, they're experts in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| field, but they can be great at giving us all the information, and we, the people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| Knox County, are best equipped to make the decisions that are best for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| My business was shut down for two and a half months this spring, and I didn't see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3016)|

| 0:50:28| I didn't see any of them stepping in there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| I don't see them stepping up, helping any of these small businesses, because in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| of the previous Board of Health meetings, obviously it was clear when restaurant owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| were talking about the funds that were there to help support them while they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| to close early and not run at full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3044)|

| 0:51:09| Where are the tips supposed to come in for that waitstaff, because everybody else is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| running around scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| If folks are scared, stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3073)|

| 0:59:30| Are you with us, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| And if you would, please state your name and your county of residence, and you have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| My name is Adam Browdy, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| The primary purpose of my appearance before you this evening is to, excuse me, express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| my support for the members of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| No doubt in the best of times serving on that body is a thankless task, but 2020 has become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| much worse, as these individuals who provide such an important public service have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| subject to far too much abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| I believe we as a community, and importantly, you as county commissioners, should be expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| gratitude for their work rather than demonizing their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| This thought leads to my second point, and that is that politicization of public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| is a terrible development for our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| I don't think anyone can disagree with the proposition that ensuring the health and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| of its citizens is a core responsibility of any government, and yet, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| the notion that only elected officials should set public health policy has gained traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Simply put, I believe such an idea is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Expertise matters, and thus leaning on the guidance of respected professionals with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| requisite background to make thoughtful, informed decisions makes all the sense in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| If anything, especially in the midst of a pandemic, political consideration should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| influence public health decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Instead, elected officials can serve us well by possessing the humility to understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| limits of their skill sets and by making wise appointments to public boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Lastly, a quick word about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| While it's my understanding a small group of fellow, as we've seen tonight, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| a small group of fellow citizens has become almost cultish in its stand against masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| I would suggest these protests are nothing more than a loud, unhelpful sideshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| In fact, I believe the vast majority of Knox Countians are more than willing to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| basic mask guidelines to not only ensure the safety of our community, but also the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| of our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| In closing, if anyone has not yet seen or heard it, I would point you to an insightful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| comment recently made by the infectious disease specialist, Dr. Celine Gounder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| She suggested that politicizing masks is like politicizing toilet paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| I would hope we can agree that both are terrible ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3690)|

| 1:01:45| That's the end of my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Is there anybody else that is on our call that has signed up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| Rob and Zach, do you all have anyone else that is in the waiting room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| There's been no one else that's identified on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Flores will be here next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3725)|

| 1:02:21| They left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| They said they'd sign up and come back next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Okay, do you know who that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3749)|

| 1:02:37| Andrew King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3757)|

| 1:02:50| All right, so that is the end of our public forum right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| I want to, I did skip the approval of the minutes, so let me make sure I get that housekeeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3776)|

| 1:06:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Noss County Commissioner for giving us a few minutes to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| funding for Noss County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| I'm sure that most of you have realized that six months ago, there was an MOU signed between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| Noss County Rescue and the Noss County government that approved funding for a six-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| and that period would have to be renewed at the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| We noticed that on your agenda when it was sent out, that there were no agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| that pertain to secure that funding would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| On December 9th, the chief of Noss County Rescue, Chief Frazier, received a letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| the county commissioner that indicated that we were going to be discussed tonight at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| commission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Therefore, the board of directors at Noss County Rescue would be remiss if we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| a part of the public forum tonight to show our support for the hardworking men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| of Noss County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| These folks have worked tirelessly to make sure that all Noss Countians are provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| with the very best service that we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| And I must remind you that under the advisory memorandum for the identification of essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| critical infrastructure workers during COVID-19, this from the Department of Homeland Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| that under the heading of law enforcement, public safety, and other first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| under bullet one, it states fire rescue services, search and rescue personnel are listed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4054)|
| 1:07:43| essential critical infrastructure workers during the COVID-19 response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Board of directors at Noss County Rescue's main point tonight is that we need sustained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| continued funding for Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| We hope that you will revisit the MOU, make it on an annual basis instead of a six month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| basis so that we can actually carry on doing what we're doing annually instead of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| to take time every six months to resubmit to Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| So it's kind of a needle for an emergency services that have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| We cannot limp along here for the next six month increments as emergency response department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| in Noss County without provided funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| Noss County Rescue has continued to provide the services without interruption, despite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| limiting lack of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| The men and women of Noss County Rescue remain here, more the citizens of Noss County, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| would appreciate the support of all Noss County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4130)|

| 1:09:14| Commissioner Smith or Biggs, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4157)|

| 1:09:22| I know we've only been in meeting a little over an hour, but we had a committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| before and I got on the phone and didn't really get a chance to take a break in between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| meeting before this one started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Commissioner Biggs, did you have your hand raised up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| I had a question for Mr. Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| Is there going to be a presentation next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| And if so, can he give us a brief cause of service over the last 90 days, if he cares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| to do that in the presentation next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4192)|

| 1:10:52| It just, there just was a little bit of mud there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4252)|

| 1:11:04| that they have been promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4264)|

| 1:11:23| that the mayor has a fire committee out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4283)|

| 1:11:37| going to need some funding above and beyond what we've been doing so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4297)|

| 1:19:10| Thank you for serving on that, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| And that is a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| So I would imagine that somebody, one of your colleagues that is on the commission might give you some up-to-speed opportunities to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4757)|
| 1:19:28| engaged in the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| So I'll leave that to Commissioner Skinmaker maybe to provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| So thank you for serving on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Mr. Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| The next item I have is page 6, item number 33, a consideration of resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| authorizing Knox County to enter a development agreement with B&A Associates, LLC, for the redevelopment of the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| This is item R20-12801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you, Mr. Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| I'll entertain a motion to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| Motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Commissioner Skinmaker on the first and Commissioner Lundy on the second to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| I'll open up the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| And Mr. Skinmaker, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Probably the best point at this juncture would be to give the finance team the opportunity to convince us that this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4826)|
| 1:20:35| best move for the taxpayers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| And then I'll follow up with some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| I do believe we have Mr. Caldwell from the finance department with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| If you are with us, if you would please make yourself known and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| Yeah, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Chris Caldwell and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| I'll start by deferring to Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| He has headed up this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| He and Ben Charble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| I'll let him speak to the project and what's before you if I can follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| Okay, Mr. Myers, if you would please state your name and your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Thank you, Commissioners, for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| Just basically what we're doing here is moving the process forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| Back in February, I believe it was 11-0 vote, you approved the sale and purchase agreement for the property at $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4887)|
| 1:21:37| This is the next step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| This is a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| It kind of governs the developer on how and when things are to happen, such as when construction starts, when construction is to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4902)|
| 1:21:56| There's obviously also a mention of a pilot that would come back to this body in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4916)|
| 1:22:04| So it's just kind of the next step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| We feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| I know things have changed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| We've never expected to be this far down the road from when we originally awarded the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4931)|
| 1:22:21| The developer has been very gracious in working with us through the TVA documents that we have approved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4941)|
| 1:22:31| I do feel that we still have a good development agreement before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4951)|
| 1:22:39| And obviously ask for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| And I will defer to finance or the Commission Chair at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| Mr. Caldwell, would you like to chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| I'll say a couple more things on what Matt said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| One thing that we have done in this agreement is because the individuals at B&A are struggling to get financing for the boutique hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4978)|
| 1:23:13| they have put in the agreement that they will convert a micro apartments to a boutique hotel within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=4993)|
| 1:23:23| And we have made their pilot subject to that to where if they don't, then there's a five-year reduction on their pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5003)|
| 1:23:34| And so that's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| And I've also had Mark Mammenthoff here as well with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| So he may have a few things to say or you may want to ask him some questions, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| Mr. Mammenthoff, if you would just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| And then Commissioner Daley, I do see your hand up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| So, Mr. Mammenthoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| It is Mark Mammenthoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| I'd be glad to answer any questions or elaborate on any of the issues that Matt touched upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5039)|
| 1:24:08| I just want to make it clear that this is not the last buy of the apple for Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| We'll be back in February if you approve this to bring you a recommendation as to a pilot structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| And so this is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| Commissioner Daley, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Mr. Myers, are you still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Did I hear you say that there was going to be a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| They are asking for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| It is in the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| We don't know the number yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| That is to be determined as we work with B&A and Associates and the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| So the purpose of selling the A.J. building was to get it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| And giving a pilot is not going to get it back on the tax rolls at full value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| So this pilot is rolled into this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| So there's a pilot agreement in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| Like any other agreement that you have voted on on a downtown development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| you're always going to ask for some sort of tax abatement, whether it be a tip or a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| And this agreement is like no other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| We'll go through a third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| And that third-party review will say whether a pilot is legitimate or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| and come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| And that's similar to any other bill you have voted on downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| whether it was the Carriagate Hotel or Embassy School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| Commissioner Daley, this is Mark Babenthoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| That's obviously a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| I just want to make, again, you are not voting on a pilot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| I mean, if we do the economic analysis of its pro formas, its protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5161)|
| 1:26:09| and it turns out a pilot is not needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| then we would come back and say we do not believe a pilot is needed for this economic revival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| I do not think that will be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| If a pilot prevents you from supporting this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| then you will get an opportunity to vote on that in February at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| At this juncture, you would be voting basically to take it to that next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| to see whether a pilot is needed or not for the project to be viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| Thank you, Mr. Manitow, for clarifying that, because that's the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| It needs to come back to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I am not in favor of a pilot since we're selling the A.J. building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| to get it back on the property tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| Mr. Myers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Page 511B says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| provision after commencement of construction, invent of a default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| Can you explain what that $5 million or 20% is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| It kind of caught me curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| And if I would, Commissioner Daley, I'd like to go ahead and defer to Mr. Manitow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| He's drafted this agreement, and we have all worked with B&A and Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| but I would like to defer to Mr. Manitow on that question, if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Yes, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Thanks for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| We've had a lot of experience with, not we like Mark Manitow, but some of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| but just generally with public properties when we've sold them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| and if the developer just sits on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| we want to make sure that we don't have what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| And the side effect, I think there was an old high school in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| that just sat there after it was purchased and not redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| So we want to be really sure that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| And so after this closes, this basically forces the developer to dive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| and work hard, and if he doesn't do that and move forward with the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| the property will revert to Knox County, and he would lose his $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| So the question with that as background, so what is the lesser of 20% or $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| So he's estimating the project cost at roughly $35 million or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| so 20% of that would be $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| So the lesser of those would likely be the $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| So once he has spent $5 million, in other words, he's really into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| and it would be very hard for him to turn back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| Then the reversionary right would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| And, again, if I were you, I'd say, well, why are you doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| Why don't you just keep the reversionary right the whole time so that if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| defaults at any point, our experience is, working on these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| is once you spend the developer's equity, which is usually the first 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| the lender, his lender or any lender will not loan against the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| that they would lose their collateral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| What they're likely to do is tell the developer, B&A, you spend your 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| and if you lose your $5 million because you default, that's on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| After that, we've got to be sure that we continue to advance the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| that we won't lose our collateral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| So that's a very similar provision the city has on the Supreme Court site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| for example, and some that we've used as a compromise on other properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| have been sold by public entities that are being redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| So it's an incentive to make sure they don't – a real hammer that they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| going on the redevelopment because if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| there could be a huge financial loss to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| This is nothing unusual that was written for this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| The developer, and he may be on here, would argue it's unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| and that it's really tough on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| He wanted it out of here, but it is something we've used on a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| projects when we're selling older schools or as the city did on the Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| Court site when it sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| This language is very similar to that language on the Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| We need to protect the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Mr. Mametoff, let me go back to the original RFP for this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5439)|
| 1:30:47| and that was back in the summer of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| One of the reasons that B&A won the bid was that they were very innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| in what they were going to do with this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| and so the other competitors obviously lost out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| So originally they were going to have 94 hotel rooms on floors three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| through eight of the property, which under this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| that doesn't happen for possibly five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| So how do the taxpayers win out when we were going to receive hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| off of those 94 units for five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| How does that make it better for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| Obviously, that's an excellent question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| and that's where we don't have scientific evidence to prove what I'm about to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5501)|
| 1:31:50| is that we have to decide and you have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| I mean, obviously this is your all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| I mean, we have a commitment to pay $6 million for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| Our sense, and when I say our, I think Chris Caldwell, mine, Matt's, others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| that in this current market with hotel properties being so devastated by the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| that we do believe that the developer is accurately telling us that it is virtually impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5537)|
| 1:32:25| to get financing for a large real estate project that has a significant hotel component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| in the near-term future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| So if we go back out for RFP again, we are likely to get either an all-apartment proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5552)|
| 1:32:42| or maybe apartments with some street-level commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| with likely no commitment for hotel use long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| So the consensus on behalf of the sort of county negotiating team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| was that it was better in the long-term to go ahead and get a commitment to convert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| to finish these rooms in a manner that they can be converted to hotel use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| And the line between hotel use and apartment use has become so blurred with Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| and things like that that it's so similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| In fact, the Supreme Court Hotel is going to be an Airbnb hotel from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| where they're not going to even have effectively what you and I would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| a traditional hotel use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| In other words, you won't have so much of the traditional welcome desk and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| So it could be converted earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| But right now, and this is consistent with what I'm seeing in my legal practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| by far the lowest-cost financing for projects that have a large apartment component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| is HUD financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| They seem to be getting most of the large deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| They're providing very long-term financing at very reasonable rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| That's what Mr. Welker and B&A want to use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| They will not do that for a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| And so they want to go ahead, finish it out for apartments to comply with HUD rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| and then convert it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| So I agree with you that it is disappointing that we would lose hotel-motel tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| during that initial five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I'm not sure if we go back and RP it, though, whether we would get a better proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| that would immediately implement hotel that we would be able to receive those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| So it's a real tradeoff between getting a commitment to eventually convert to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| versus going back out and not knowing whether we'll get any sort of hotel commitment at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| And that's where none of us, I guess, really know what would happen if we go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| and seek proposals again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| And in their original proposal, they said that this was going to be a great economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| and community impact with potential of 100 permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| So, you know, how does that benefit, you know, Commissioner Lundy and Commissioner Daley's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| district if those 100 jobs aren't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| And, you know, they talked about $3.7 million in annual gross payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| So basically that goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| So how is that a benefit to the taxpayers in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| Again, an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| From our conversation with the developer, I keep in mind that the lower floors that would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| for commercial use would still be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| And so a significant number of those jobs would still be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| He has some very creative commercial ideas for creative use, both on the lower floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| and possibly in the penthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| So the total number of jobs, you're right, would not occur as quickly as hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| But there would be a significant number of jobs from day one, certainly significantly larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| than if we got new proposals and the best proposal was purely an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| And so we would be getting some jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| You're absolutely right that the job numbers are going to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| They're not going to get the full economic development that was in his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| And that's obviously why we delayed this two months, because we have been struggling with the same issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| that you have, and they're all valid issues and good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| And, you know, if we could play both hands at the same time and see what a new proposal would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| versus going with this one, it would be pretty neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| But we just, you know, I think we either have to decide whether we're going to go with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| or whether you guys want to go out and do another RFP for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| Well, and the building is occupied until basically September 1st of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| And we have no idea what's going to happen between now and then with the health aspects in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| nor the financial aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| And since, you know, we already own the building, once the school vacates that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| it still would be an income-producing property of about $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| So why don't we just sit on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5827)|
| 1:37:19| I'm sorry, Commissioner Scamaran, you followed the $100,000 a year income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Well, the top floor, the income we get from Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| That would cover if the building was just closed off after September 1st and we sent out a new RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| we still have income to cover electrical whatever expenses, so it wouldn't be a burden at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| And again, it'd be, you know, nine months from now when we don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| But so is there any discussion there to just hold on to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| This is Matt Myers speaking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| And, you know, I mean, we obviously don't know what utility costs run in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| even if you were to scale everything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| You know, if you go back and look at the, you know, the economic impact was included in obviously B&A's cover letter to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5889)|
| 1:38:19| But if you scale all that back and everybody was graded on or scored on just, you know, apartments or condos or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5899)|
| 1:38:30| $6 million or $5.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| And then it scaled back after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| I mean, you know, we're still getting and we're not obviously talking about the sale and purchase agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| We're talking about moving forward with the development agreement and allowing the developer to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| see in these next nine months when we get to January that he can pull everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5928)|
| 1:38:57| You know, 100 permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| That might have been a little bit of a stretch, at least from the hotel aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Obviously, we'll have, you know, commercial space on the lower floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| Obviously wouldn't be 100 jobs on the lower floors, but we would have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| So, you know, I think we need to obviously go back and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| we're looking at the development agreement and allowing the developer to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| obviously try to make this work and we believe he can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| And, you know, the issue about the pilot, you know, I've sent information about other pilots in the downtown area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5970)|
| 1:39:41| It'd be irresponsible to think that no one would have asked for a pilot on this building or any building, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5981)|
| 1:39:49| that was downtown that is going to be redeveloped and refurbished and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| So, you know, I think we, I personally believe we owe it to the developer to try to let him make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=5995)|
| 1:40:07| I see hands raised from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| I have one. Can I just finish my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I thought you were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| And just finally, in his letter to your office, he said, and this kind of goes into what Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6014)|
| 1:40:23| but he says, simple, no strings attached offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| We are offering a fair cash price with no contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6027)|
| 1:40:34| And I'll defer to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| I have hands up from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I do see you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| But before that, I saw Commissioner Bussler and Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| So I'm going to go in that order and I'll come back to you, Commissioner Smith, or Commissioner Daley after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6048)|
| 1:40:56| So, Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Do I have my mute off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| First, this is not about the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| The sale has, that agreement has been placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| But I will speak to that very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| Given the current economic conditions we're in, I don't believe you would find anybody that would pay much of anything for a piece of property to open a hotel right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6072)|
| 1:41:23| We see what office space has happened to office space values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| The only thing that has went up is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| And this, I think, is an opportunity that we can have a hotel in the future when the economy turns around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6092)|
| 1:41:40| And I think it will eventually get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| But you have to remember, since we entered into this agreement with B&A, how many hotel rooms have come online downtown and what has happened to the economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6103)|
| 1:41:52| I think in the long run, this is probably about the best we're going to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| There probably will be a pilot coming for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| I just think that this is the only way we're going to get to what we wanted originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6122)|
| 1:42:12| And I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| As far as setting on the building, nothing hurts a building more than being vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| There's also liability issues when you have a vacant building in a downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| Can you keep it insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Will the insurer cover it if it's a vacant building after it sits for so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| And then if we're not able to get a deal come September on something else, how long will it sit then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| I just think that at this point, this is not what we all wanted, but it's probably the best thing we can do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| I've said this many, many times in the last nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| We don't get to make great decisions anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| We just get to make decisions that mitigate and do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| And I think this is probably the best thing we can do for downtown and the taxpayers at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Commissioner Busler, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| If you would take yourself off mute first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| These are a couple of questions I need to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| If we do a pilot, say, for five years, okay, does the pilot stay with the property or does it go with the owners of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6201)|
| 1:43:31| Who's it with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| Is it with the property or with the owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| That's the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Mr. Busler, that would be determined by the assignment provisions and the pilot lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| I know you know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| I'm just stating it for people that are watching that, you know, when you do a pilot under Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| it's through Industrial Development Board who then leases it to the person who's getting the benefit of the tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| And so that would be determined by whether he would have the developer has the right to assign it to a successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6236)|
| 1:44:03| Typically, in these types of transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| you allow assignment subject to reasonable approval after the building is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| and you're no longer relying on who you selected for the proposal to be able to sell the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| But that certainly is something that could be negotiated if it's of importance to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| The second thing I have up here is we're talking about a five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| And between that five-year period to the end, if we make it into apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| the value of the property goes really up because that's an investment property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| that starts turning over investments back to the investors that are buying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| So, therefore, if you get it up and it looks very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| then the individual that has control of the property, which is B&A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| could resell it for more than, say, the $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| Maybe they could double their costs on it before they get it completely finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| and sell it to another person that takes it to the next level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| so they can get their $6 million back plus $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| So, what have we done in that time frame for the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| We've lost a heck of a lot of money by giving that pilot out to those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| without getting something in concrete saying that they will take it to that next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| You have it on the first end of it, but once the property is sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| and they get a loan for apartments, it's going to be apartments, no matter what you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| because nobody's going to invest in something unless they have a concrete interest in what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| So, I think in some ways, the pilot is an issue in and of itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| and the way the developer could get it and resell it and redo part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| and then sell it to another investor that would take it on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| And I'm just not sure that we're going to gain any money on it, not gain money on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| but we're not taking care of the taxpayers' dollars properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| That's all my concern is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Haley of the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Have the developers indicated what the price point might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| the rental on these 300-square-foot apartments that there's going to be a lot of in this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6377)|
| 1:46:26| Commissioner Adil, this is again Mark Mammontoffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| We don't have any data on that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| That would be part of the information we would gather as part of evaluating the financial statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| of the proposed project and whether it needed a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| One of the critical input items in that sort of analysis is the grants on all the apartments and the projected incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6408)|
| 1:46:55| So, we would definitely have all that information available as part of the analysis as to whether a pilot is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6415)|
| 1:47:05| the project to be economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| The answer is that we don't have that information immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| but we certainly could have it before you voted on whether to get the next sort of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| I'm going to go to Commissioner Lundy first before I go back to second rounds of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| I have a question myself. Commissioner Lundy of the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| I know it's obvious I was not on the commission when they talked about the sale of the AJ building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| but I do want to say that I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| We do need to do something with that property. I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| And just on behalf of the community, I live in a community full of blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| I do not want a building to sit. I think that's a waste of money overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| And I live in a community that wish they could have pilots offered to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| And that's why we're still in blight, especially in East Knoxville. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. Before I go to second rounds of comments, I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| Could you, just to recap, I don't know if Chris wants to take this or Matt Myers or Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| Could you explain the sort of three or four-step process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| We did the sale agreement last spring, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| This is the development agreement of how the property will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Then if there is any kind of pilot, that would come through a whole separate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| And, I mean, there's four or five pieces to this. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Much beyond the RFP. I mean, that was the first thing was the RFP, then the bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| Can you just walk us through the whole thing and where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Absolutely. Mr. Chairman, the RFP was actually done back in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| So it's about three years old. The sales agreement happened in March of this year, so March of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| But as you said, this is the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| We will be bringing you all a pilot agreement in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| And that's done by a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| So keep in mind that we don't decide whether we're going to give a pilot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| It's done by a third-party review, which is a requirement of the city and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| And we agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| At that time, we'll also be bringing forward what the pilot payment should be from the developer over that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6559)|
| 1:49:29| And then for us, the next piece is closing in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| Thank you for the explanation. Commissioner Daley, and then I'll recognize Commissioner Smith after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Manitow, you probably know the answer to the first one, but not the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| How much sales tax dollars will the county receive off of the A.J. Building when it's all said and done as far as sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6588)|
| 1:49:59| Zero, because it all goes to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| The schools will get their roughly 72 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| But you're right. To the general fund of the county, all the sales tax dollars either goes to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6607)|
| 1:50:17| or to the city, because it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| Oh, you're talking because it is in the TDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| Until the TDC goes away, then it goes to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| The increment goes to support the TDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| It's a very complicated calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| So, you know, I just said what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| It all depends on base taxes and increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| But yes, for the near term future, it will go generally to go pay off the convention center along with other downtown sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6640)|
| 1:50:48| But once that rolls off, and believe it or not, that's going to roll off probably five to six years after the completion of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| then it would go to the schools and to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| Do you know what the property tax would be currently and then what the property tax would be with the filing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6660)|
| 1:51:11| And if you don't have that, you can get it for us next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Matt Myers is on here, as you know, and he and I and Ben Charbel and Chris have spent a lot of time debating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| You know, the AHA is such an unusual building that our assessor really has not had reason to formally assess that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| So we don't really have a good legal assessment on which to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| There's an old appraisal that I know some of you are aware of that was higher than the $6 million price that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| it's not really arm's length because, I mean, until we RFPed it, we don't really know what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| And obviously whether or not there's a pilot affects the ultimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| In other words, if we went out for an RFP again and said, please submit your bids, but be aware you will not receive a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| we probably will get significantly less money up front, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| We just need to be, you know, I think if we do RFP it again, we need to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| But the taxes at a $6 million price, if we use that as the valuation, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| it's about $113,000 a year total between the city and the county, slightly more, you know, half that to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| And then fully built out using the downtown Hyatt Place and the Hilton as comps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6745)|
| 1:52:33| which is about the best comps Matt and Ben could come up with, which I think are really pretty good comps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| And even though the Farragut is on a pilot, the old Farragut Hotel, they do have a decent assessment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| You're roughly looking at, Matt, please correct me if I'm getting this wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| about a half a million dollars a year of joint taxes between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| I'm sorry I didn't follow you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| So now it's worth $100,000 a year split between the city and the county, but if piloted, it could be up to $500,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| Right. Let's assume there was no pilot, roughly, yes, roughly about $500,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| And Matt, I don't know if you're on, because I would appreciate it if you would weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| Ben had some more precise figures at the higher valuations that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6795)|
| 1:53:24| He's muting me, so I think he doesn't want to talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| Well, if you could send some of those numbers, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| If you all move this to February, we're going to have to bore you with a very detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| I know it's not really boring, but that's exactly the sort of deep dive we're going to have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| into how much we would be giving up and whether it makes you all get to decide whether that's the best interest of the county or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6823)|
| 1:53:52| Thank you, Mr. Mattoff, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| Mr. Mattoff, I want to go back to Mr. Daley's question and try to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| Currently, right now, we receive zero property tax off of the AHA building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| and we will continue to receive zero property tax off the AHA building as long as it remains in Knox County's possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6854)|
| 1:54:26| Yes, that's absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| And if I could correct, not significantly, but correct what I told Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| so at a $6 million appraised value, I found the chart, it's $117,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| That would be the taxes if you close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| Right now, it's zero, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| And so much like, for example, the candy factory, when that was redeveloped and the city did a TIF on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| there was no taxes, and so the entire increment went to help pay off that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| Here, you have a zero tax basis in the property, so that's where the negotiations get a little more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| But if it was put on the tax rolls at the $6 million initial purchase price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| the county taxes would be roughly $51,000, and the city taxes would be roughly $66,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6911)|
| 1:55:19| And then if you had roughly a $25 million valuation of the property, which I think is conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6919)|
| 1:55:30| then the taxes, again, if it were on the tax rolls and not subject to a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| it would be $519,000 is what the valuation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| And that's probably on the low side, depending on where you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| But we just have no comparable valuations for a property of that nature downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| You know, again, the fair, again, is probably the closest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| Sorry, Commissioner Smith, I just found that chart as you were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| I know how you like charts, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| I like charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| I would like to bring us back around to what's actually before us, and that is the simple development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6960)|
| 1:56:09| Do we have to decide tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Well, we don't because this has actually been moved without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| But it's good to have this topic and talk tonight because we need to be able to decide next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| if what before us is the way this development agreement is laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| It's not about a TIF or a pilot or anything like that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| It's a matter of is this the way we want the development to go on this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| And I will go back to this is not exactly how we wanted this to go, but this is 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| and nothing has gone how we want it to this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| I think this development plan gives us the best opportunity to get where we want to be within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7006)|
| 1:56:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7017)|

| 1:57:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker had the first, Commissioner Lundy second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| Okay, we had Commissioner Schoonmaker on the first, Commissioner Lundy on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| This is to a vote to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7039)|

| 1:58:34| This is R20-12-902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7114)|

| 1:59:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Mr. Manitow, I think you're the expert on sports authorities, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| That's what the media seems to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| But yes, I got a lot of calls about sports authorities lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| But I have spent a lot of time over the years working with sports authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| So I feel like I've got experience with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| How many sports authorities are in Tennessee that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| I did a search on the Secretary of State's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| I think I identified seven, but I'm not sure, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| Some of them are more active than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| But by far, the most active ones are in Nashville and Mount Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| Do you have any of their bylaws that they have set up for their authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| for a reference point by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| I do have Metro Nashville's bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| I have not gotten Memphis' bylaws yet, but I certainly can get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| It would be interesting just to see what these bylaws would kind of look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| I'll be glad to get them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| I see on the – I keep finding all this paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| but it's going to be seven members on the sports authority, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| State law requires a minimum of seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| I think the feeling among the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| and the county administration was that seven was a good workable number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| and that was what is being recommended and requested of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| is to do the seven-member board, which is what state law –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| the minimum that state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| Can the county commission be represented by a member of county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| Can I have an official or an employee of either body on that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7241)|
| 2:00:47| I'm sorry, I did not hear the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Can I have an officer or an employee of either the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| serve on that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| Cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| Again, this is – the sales tax dollars will go to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7260)|
| 2:01:07| I know 70 cents of every dollar goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| But the county residents outside the city will not see any sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| I'm kind of concerned, and the mayor and I spoke about this a week or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| that this is going to be inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| and I think the city ought to be taking more of the risk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| I don't know if that risk is two-thirds to one-third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| or three-quarters to a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| but hopefully that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| I just don't want to put the citizens outside the city that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7303)|
| 2:01:51| we're going to see a benefit some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| but most of the largest benefits are going to be inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| from Market Square, Lowe's City, and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| That's where the benefit is going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| So, Mr. Manitoff, are we in a big hurry to get this done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| Are we on a deadline time-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| The – I'm sorry, I don't want to respond to that because it's not certainly –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7331)|
| 2:02:19| the team has indicated that they would like to play their first games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| for the 2023 season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| So, the deadline is that they do not believe that if we are not able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| in a position to close the financing of the stadium and to proceed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| construction projects by next summer, that they would be able to meet that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| And so that is the timeline, is to try to let them play at their request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| in the 2023 season here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| Parker, Chris, I'm not – I'm nowhere near –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| I didn't sleep at the Holiday Inn or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| so numbers is something that I don't – you guys that work numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| I really feel for you, but we're looking at, according to the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| $50 to $60 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Chris, what type of bonds are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| I know the bonds are very, very good right now, are very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| so it might be a good thing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| But then, Chris, will we be able to 10 years from now on a 30-year bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| be able to go to the city and say, hey, we can reduce our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| we can save a million dollars by reducing or refinancing these bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Do you follow what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| What you're saying – so here's what I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| and it kind of goes by creating a sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| you're not locking yourself into anything first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| If we get down the road and baseball does not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| all we have to do is dissolve the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| The advantages of a sports authority is it allows us to collect all the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| within the side of the stadium, the state's fees and the local fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| and it goes towards the sports authority for the retirement of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| So that's the advantage of a sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| The other advantage is all the debt would be issued through the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| with the backstop of the city and county taxing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| But the debt is issued through the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| It gets kind of complex, and so we've kind of talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| for roughly Mark and myself, is part of this debt will be tax-exempt debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| and part of it will be taxable debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| But we've looked at it from the standpoint of like a 30-year bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| and if you just do the rough numbers of about $62 billion of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| we think it's about $4 million a year in principal and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| And so that's just kind of where we are with the rough math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| But all that would be coming through the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| but the backstop is definitely the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| Thank you, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| In order of the hands I've seen raised, Lundy Bigg, Schoonmaker, and Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| So we'll start with Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| I think Chris Caldwell already answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| I just wanted to make sure if we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| does this guarantee baseball is coming to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| Commissioner, thank you for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| No, it does not mean that baseball is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| In the documents sent out, you can also see where we can dissolve this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| So if we form this committee and the mayors jointly appoint the members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7546)|
| 2:05:54| even after that point, we can easily dissolve the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| because if we don't come to an agreement on baseball, then the sports authority will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7559)|
| 2:06:06| Okay. And thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| And one more question, just for clarification, because I think you already mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| So once this authority, if this authority takes place and they come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| they will determine all financing options, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Ultimately, we would do all financing through the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| It would come back to the commission and council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| so you all would know what's happening because we would be the backstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| You would know what bonds we were going to issue or whatever financial impact was going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7594)|
| 2:06:42| because we would be the backstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Ultimately, if we keep moving forward on baseball and things progress well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7606)|
| 2:06:54| we will be bringing before you all eventually what we think is a plan from a financing standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7614)|
| 2:07:01| of how the debt could be financed and how we plan on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| But we're not at that point yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Chris, just looking over the resolution, is this geared towards minor and major league teams only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| State law, Commissioner Biggs, provides that if you build a double-A baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| you can have the sales tax, the state component of sales tax off the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| So this effort is tied to that specific statute that addresses double-A baseball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7656)|
| 2:07:44| There is a separate statute that deals with major league baseball as well as NBA, NFL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7664)|
| 2:07:51| and NHL teams, and now was amended to include the MLS team in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7671)|
| 2:07:58| So it's in the same area of the law, but this particular statute we're relying on only applies to double-A baseball teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7678)|
| 2:08:05| certain types of minor league hockey teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| And I can get you the list, but this specific statute is not a major league baseball statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| And the reason I'm asking is because, obviously, we have the Ice Bears, we're looking at Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| We also just started talking about an opportunity to have a sports park off the Watt Road exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7702)|
| 2:08:31| It's to my understanding that some of that portion is finger-annexed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| and I'm wondering to know if this will have anything that if we were to house something outside of the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7715)|
| 2:08:41| like a minor league soccer team at that specific area, what would that do with any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7721)|
| 2:08:49| Or is this specifically just geared towards baseball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| At this juncture, it's only geared, or this effort is only geared toward baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| Right now, I do not believe the statute includes any of the minor league soccer, like the PBL or the League One-type activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7740)|
| 2:09:10| They are a statute that, as you know, minor league soccer, I know that's not the term that is typically used in soccer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7750)|
| 2:09:22| but is not as prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| And the hockey references are kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| They're outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| Some of them are referring to leagues that don't even exist anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| And so, you know, this statute gets amended all the time by people wanting to add things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| The most recent one, as I mentioned, was the last legislative session, they added MLS as an eligible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| That's why when they added MLS, they didn't add minor league soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| And so I'm pretty sure there's not minor league soccer included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| You'd have to probably amend the statute to do that, to help the sports part of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Thank you, Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| Just a quick clarifying question before we move on with our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| Mr. Caldwell, if I understand correctly, this resolution and formation of the sports authority of the city and county is to establish the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7802)|
| 2:10:11| which constitutes what taxes can be collected in state versus local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| and essentially creates the legal entity in which could then pursue a stadium and financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| That stadium could be used for baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| It could be used for soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| It could be used for concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| It could be used for rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| It could be used for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| It's the legal entity that would essentially own the vessel that then, separate of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| leases with different sports leagues or teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| It could be a baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| It could be a minor league soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| It could be a concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| It could be any kind of other things would do their deals with that sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| Is that accurate in the sort of legal formation of what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| Chairman James Mark again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| Just to be clear, this does not establish any sort of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| Right now what state law does, it just governs the stadium itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| At some point we may ask to expand that legislatively, but right now state law just says we get the income sales tax revenues off the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7868)|
| 2:11:19| When I say we, it specifically references that it should go to the sports authority to pay debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| You could identify a different entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| A couple of people have used industrial development boards, but we don't have a joint industrial development board in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| So it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Again, I don't know how much time you'll want to spend on this tonight, but for various financing reasons, sports authority is what has largely been used by other jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7894)|
| 2:11:46| Titans, Coliseum, the Bridgestone, and now the MLS Stadium and the Sounds are all done using a sports authority structure where when Chris talks about a backstop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7906)|
| 2:11:58| it's really, again, I don't know how much time you'll want to hear about this tonight, but it's not a traditional guarantee backstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| There's a specific provision in the law that would allow the county and the city to make up shortfalls from non-property tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7924)|
| 2:12:12| So you can never be forced to raise property taxes to pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| What you could be forced to do is to make sure you use your non-property tax revenues such as sales taxes and stuff to pay for the stadium to the extent you agree to do that at some point under a funding agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7936)|
| 2:12:29| This sports authority can't go rogue and go do its own financing and obligate the county in any way because they cannot do that without some sort of funding agreement from you all basically to approve the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7949)|
| 2:12:42| So to go back, for example, to Commissioner Lundy's question, well, you all have a full opportunity to vet the financing to sign off on indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7962)|
| 2:12:50| This will not move forward without through all full involvement and consent and satisfaction with the financing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7970)|
| 2:12:57| But ultimately, is a sports authority likely to be the financing tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| Yes. And the main reason why is that you can't finance a stadium that is leased long term to a private team because of constitutional reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7982)|
| 2:13:13| And the sports authorities were largely set up to allow communities to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7993)|
| 2:13:19| That's why a sports authority has been the typical vehicle under state law that's been used to do professional sports stadiums in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=7999)|
| 2:13:27| Thank you very much. Commissioner Ward, you had your hand up, but it went back down. Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| Yeah, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Okay. Commissioner Skinmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| Thank you, Chairman Jay. Mr. Mametoff, what kind of upfront funding would the sports authority need to get this off the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8017)|
| 2:13:49| No, this is initially would be, I mean, there wouldn't be any, I don't believe there'd be any in terms of a budget or any dollars allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8029)|
| 2:13:59| There may be minor funding to hold organizational meetings, to consider bylaws, as Commissioner Bailey was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| They would have an organizational meeting, I would say, after appointed by officers, about bylaws, about their ethics policy, and to address those kind of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8045)|
| 2:14:15| Again, the city and county would need to agree on these kind of things, but I think that the thought, at least in the near term future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| and certainly before any money would be spent, I'd have to come back to you all, is would be to just provide logistical support from the county and the city directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8063)|
| 2:14:35| so that there would not be any direct expense at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| Okay. Thank you very much. I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| Mr. Mamatov, I wanted to make sure I had this correct, because I was very glad you pointed this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8088)|
| 2:14:58| that any financial obligation that's made cannot be made by the sports authority without coming back to this commission and city council to get approval of a funding agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8098)|
| 2:15:13| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Yeah, that is correct, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| I should, as a qualifier to that, say, if this will not happen, I'm going to tell you this up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8117)|
| 2:15:26| if the sports authority could finance the stadium based on rent, incremental sales tax revenues, and various other sources of funds without any county or city support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8126)|
| 2:15:36| that would be the biggest home run, and I'm sorry to use a baseball analogy, in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| And you guys thrilled that we would never come back to you to ask for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| I do not think that is likely at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| I think we will be back to you all sometime in a few months and doing a long presentation saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| here's the expected revenue streams that we expect to be available to pledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| including rent, incremental sales tax revenues, and other sources to pay these bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| This is the expected shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| This is the county's share of that expected shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| You guys want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| And to Commissioner Daley's point about the revenues and where they go, and, you know, I agree with him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8172)|
| 2:16:21| Sometimes as a county commissioner, it's very tough to spend money on projects that are within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8181)|
| 2:16:30| because the tax revenue really doesn't make its way fully back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| I think in this project, we have to look at our direct costs, and that is any revenue shortfall that this can't pay for itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8196)|
| 2:16:47| and weigh that against the indirect benefits that that can provide for people of Knox County that live outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| And some of those things, I think, are, one, a great family entertainment value venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8215)|
| 2:17:01| Perhaps this place could also have concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| We could have different types of entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| And, two, does it help us recruit the businesses and industry by providing a culture here in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8226)|
| 2:17:16| that makes it easier for us to get corporations and manufacturers to come here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8236)|
| 2:17:22| But, again, these are things that are way down the road on this that will be coming back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8242)|
| 2:17:28| And what's before us right now is simply creating the sports authority, which is the first stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| And real wallet does is say, yes, we've got a sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| Come back with everything else, and we'll decide how we feel about the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| And if you don't mind me responding slightly to that and go back to Commissioner Daly's question and point about revenue streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8266)|
| 2:17:54| One thing that we definitely will be coming back to you all with is projections of revenue streams to both the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| For example, hotel-motel taxes, to what extent the county would benefit from that based on projected stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| Generally, obviously, the baseball stadium, the regular games would be drawing just in the nearby region and would not result in a lot of hotel-motel stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8287)|
| 2:18:17| But we certainly hope that concerts, other types of more special project-type games, things like that, will have a significant draw from a hotel-motel tax standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8297)|
| 2:18:27| Those are the sort of things we need to get our arms around and try to bring them back to you guys so you can evaluate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| and make the best informed decision we can provide you with information on what the cost is to the county and the ultimate benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| Certainly, Chris's goal, and I know the mayor's goal, is to avoid committing any dollars other than those generated by essentially tourism-type sources to pay down services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8319)|
| 2:18:51| And to piggyback off what Mark is saying, this is a little...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| This is Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Chris, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| And this will give you a little kind of a heads-up of what we're thinking as it relates to the baseball market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8337)|
| 2:19:03| So I'm saying that eventually, if things go well, we're going to come back to you all with a presentation and show you what the shortfall is when we take all of our revenue sources and compare it to our expenses related to debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8343)|
| 2:19:16| One advantage that we have is I feel like we and the mayor feel like we can make up our shortfall with hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8356)|
| 2:19:27| So not coming from our general fund, so just basically using hotel-motel tax to our advantage to help cover that shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8367)|
| 2:19:38| So that can be done, that is legal, and we think that's to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| We know that our payment to the convention center rolls off in the next eight or nine years, maybe sooner, and so that frees up that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8385)|
| 2:19:55| And so we have a plan to use hotel-motel tax to cover our shortfall as it relates to baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8395)|
| 2:20:04| Commissioner Smith, do you have any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| No, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| Commissioner Bussler, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Am I on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Okay. The sports authority is going to have private citizens working on the sports authority that has no connection with the city or the county, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8419)|
| 2:20:30| Well, what we're talking about is serving on the board, not working per se, but just like a legislative body, not salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8430)|
| 2:20:43| Well, I was wondering, some sports authorities do have salaried personnel to work in the private sector that has no tie to the government so they can do things quicker and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8443)|
| 2:20:53| But anyway, I just asked that question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| I'm not seeing any other hands raised, and right now we do have a first from Commissioner Lundy and a second from Commissioner Daley with a recommendation to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8459)|
| 2:21:09| That's a motion to move forward without recommendation. Is there any further discussion before we take a vote on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8469)|
| 2:21:17| Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| I move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| Commissioner Bussler votes aye. Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| Commissioner Beeler votes aye. Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Commissioner Daley votes aye. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8496)|

| 2:22:28| Agenda item number 39, consideration of resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, amending the Knox County Commission rules to add a new section to Rule 6 entitled Miscellaneous, regarding the use of discretionary funds by outgoing commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8548)|

| 2:22:54| Yes, we were looking at this resolution to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| I need a motion and a second before we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| I'll make a motion that we accept this rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| So we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| Second, Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8589)|

| 2:23:22| Yes, we made this rule change because we had outgoing commissioners at some times to spend all their discretionary funds at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8602)|
| 2:23:32| So incoming commissioners, since it wasn't a full year, were without their discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| And we made this rule change to take care of that overspending of taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| Is there any discussion from the members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8624)|
| 2:23:55| Seeing none, we have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Bussler to approve with a second from Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8635)|
