| 0:00:05| On page 11, Resolution 901, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:11| County, Tennessee requesting that the Knox County Mayor amend the Knox County Employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11)|
| 0:00:14| Handbook to add a section to preclude Knox County from admitting severance payments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=14)|
| 0:00:19| Knox County employees for work not performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| Yes, I made some comments about this last week and I just want to talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:34| more about it this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| I did kind of a simple Google search on the request of someone and there actually are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:51| several county governments who routinely use severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| Not all county governments do, but it's simple enough to find a good representation of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| with a Google search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| One of my big concerns is how we are treating our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:15| If we want good employees, then we need to treat them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=75)|
| 0:01:23| I'm not saying that we need to be at the top of the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| I'm not saying that we need to give incredibly generous benefit packages, but if we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:36| as we say, the best and the brightest working for a government, then we have to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| be competitive with the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| I feel like what we're doing is tying the hands of people in HR and department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=108)|
| 0:02:04| and being able to recruit and retain the best people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| Joe has a point that this could certainly be abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| I think that there's probably a very small percentage in any group or any organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| that's going to abuse any policy that's not debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:34| That's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| I think there's ways that you can help prevent it, but I don't think that we should penalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| 99% of the people because of the possible transgressions of 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:53| I feel like because of what's happened recently, there's been a very negative impact on morale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| in county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| I feel like these county employees are not just working for our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| They also are our constituents, and we need to make sure that everyone is treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=192)|
| 0:03:23| If we want to recruit the best and retain the best, then we should not be tying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| hands of our human resources department and their ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| I think this is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| If we're concerned about possible abuses, it's easy enough to add something that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| if a severance package is ever negotiated, it has to be signed off on by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| or something such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| I think this is just a knee-jerk reaction to an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=237)|
| 0:04:07| I think that what's going on is, I think we're seeing some, well, I'll just say I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:17| disappointed with what I've seen so far in terms of what's happening with these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| and what's happening with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| I don't want to see it happen to any other county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| They are looking to us to make sure that they are treated fairly, and they are our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Yeah, I'd have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:49| Government service is just that, it's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| When you accept a government position, whether it be an appointed position or a general worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=292)|
| 0:05:02| position, you understand that working for the government doesn't have the perks of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| private sector, and it shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| The private sector is responsible for profit, they're responsible for their board, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| trustee or their shareholders, and Knox County is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| We have the shareholders or the taxpayers, and that's what we're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| I can't think of any instance where it would be an appropriate measure to give someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| If you're going to downsize, I think give them a warning, and that's their severance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| but they work and they get paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| I don't think that, you know, I understand what former Mayor Ragsdale was doing, he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| trying to take care of people that he entrusted to run his departments, knowing that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| would not have a job the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| I understand and appreciate his commitment to his employees that he trusted, but Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=355)|
| 0:06:05| County, or any government for that matter, should not be given severance packages for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| work that's not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| It's not our money, it's the taxpayers' money, and I will vote for this based on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| that I can't think of an appropriate measure where a severance package would be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:26| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Commissioner Anders, I agree with you with those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Mr. Law Director, do you know, or maybe Francis, if you know, have we ever given severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| packages to anybody in the Sheriff's Department or anybody in the School Department or anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| in Knox County before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Francis, have we, can you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:56| And Francis, you may not have any control over the school, but we've got the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| superintendent here if we need to ask him, but the Sheriff was here, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| I don't have any figures concerning the schools, but the answer is yes, we have given severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| payments in other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| And how often, when was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:22| We have given some, the report that I have runs from 2005 to current, and there appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| to be some severance payments in each year, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, perhaps not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=450)|
| 0:07:43| in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| What kind of dollar figure are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| Total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Or per individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Well, I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| The total, the total for the past five years is $255,786.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| And who were those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| They are various individuals in several different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| Are we allowed to know, I mean, I don't, are we allowed to know this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Yes, and public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Actually, Larry, I asked for this a couple of weeks ago and got it from Francis, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| I've been doing some research on this, so I've got it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| I can forward it to every commissioner if everyone would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| If it's public record, go over it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| It looks like there's over a hundred, about 125 severance payments in the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| in Knox County and various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| And some of these are repeating payments to the same individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| For example, a person may be, may receive three, four, five, six separate payrolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| So their name may be on here numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Women's separate payrolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Well, for example, they may offer a severance payment to somebody for three or four separate paydays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| So their name will be on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| They got it this payday and then the next and the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| So all the dates of the paydays are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Instead of getting a lump sum, they would get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| They just took it over times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| How many, not counting just the individuals, how many individuals then got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| This report isn't counted out as individuals, but it shows some, I'll tell you, some from the county clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| some from the mayor's department, some from MPC, PBA, and the trustee's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| Those are the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Say MPC, PBA, who authorizes that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Frances, who authorizes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| It would be the directors of those particular, or the elected official of those particular departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| Payroll does not issue any severance payments without having an authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| What is the largest of some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Maybe the top three just looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Well, it's hard to tell because the ones for several of them are broken into such individual payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| that I can't see exactly what the individual total is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| For example, there are several people that received payments over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| We could run a report and determine that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Do you know if this was an agreement that went through the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| or was this just something that was agreed upon by the elected official and the individual with whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| I know that in several cases it did go through the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| because I saw, I have a copy of that, those individual agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| But that's for only two individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I don't personally hold a copy of agreements for these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Commissioners, I want to ask that we follow protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Commissioner Smith, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| I just want to get the opinion from the law director at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Joe, what's your opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Well, I know that I've never reviewed packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| And, again, there's a distinction between the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| and some of these other separate elected bodies politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| For instance, the property assessor, the trustee, their power and authority is actually derived from state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| and state law and not the county court of charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| You'll find our charter defers to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| But what I mentioned to you in the past and in my memorandum as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| where a county body politic, in other words, a county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| before the courts have recognized a severance as being permissible or legal, it asks for multiple criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| For instance, that there is a written agreement by mutual assent of the parties predicated on a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| or code or other section of your code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| In those instances, the courts have said that it's probable that those could be legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| But in this particular case, as to these three individuals, I don't believe there is a legal basis or foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:27| And I think that people often say, well, you've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| It's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Twenty wrongs don't make a right, whether or not it was appropriate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| But the point is, and, again, as I mentioned earlier, if you are going to consider severance payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| the only way to do that legally and make it legally defensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| and not expose the county to suits of ouster for mishandling or misfeasance of county funds is to codify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| to actually state unequivocally in your code that under the following criterion, severance payments are applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| Now, I think that possibly would be defensible, but, again, not definitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| Again, it is a dangerous thing to do, I think, especially with a county charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| where it's absolutely silent as to the ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| Francis, you're just bringing us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| You're just, I'm flabbergasted at this to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Yeah, I would like to see that list of who's got what and maybe who's still getting what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| As a rule, are these supervisory positions that are getting these severance packages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| I mean, does the man out there cutting the grass, does he get a severance package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| That's, you know, I go back to what Brad says, and I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| You know, this is the taxpayer's money that we're giving this money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| It's like, you know, supervisors think that, you know, they've got an unlimited budget, let's just give these people this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:57| What type of people are getting these money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Job titles are not listed for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Sometimes it's just the department, so you'll have to amend the report to try to get the job titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Yeah, if you can let us know what their titles are, because, you know, what I'm getting at is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| your average worker out here, if he or she says they don't get a severance package, I would not think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| but I'm just flabbergasted that this has been going on and that we've not been aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| May I ask a couple of questions about this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| I'm not sure that it's clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| It says that severance pay is defined as a form of compensation to an employee beyond his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| or her wages upon termination of his or her employment for work not performed by said employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| Did you intend this to include the payout of accrued annual leave, which is payment for work not performed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| No, that's benefits earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| I think they're talking about three months of not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| but getting paid besides their annual leave and sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| Did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| It said that we shall not remit severance payments to county employees for work performed under any circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| So there would be no circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| And to bring that up, I know that Commissioner Anders did make a few points previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| but I might point out that there are a few instances in which severance payments are certainly not unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| And one would be if we had layoffs, perhaps if we had a mass layoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| And that is done by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| That's done, you know, many local employers have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| If there is a position elimination, sometimes you might want to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| You might use this as an incentive for early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I'm just saying that I can think of instances when you might want to consider severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| And so I'm just questioning whether or not you want to think about that as you form this resolution to say that it shall never occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| You know, I think this conversation speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| Just like I'm sure the law director was a little upset that this process, and rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| that this process happened without him being involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| By the same token, we've got a resolution in the ordinance here that obviously has not included human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| Let's slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Let's do the right thing by the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| Okay, let's not try to get a headline here or emotions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| Let's come up with something that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| The new mayor is talking about efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| The new mayor is talking about trying to potentially, I'm not going to put words in his mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| but when I hear efficiency, that means doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| That may mean a layoff down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| Ms. Fogarty is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| She's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| There are companies, there are entities, there are governmental bodies that offer service in that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| That still nets the county or the state or the federal entity a savings by reducing payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:29| What am I saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| I think we've moved out a little hastily on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| I don't like the way this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| I do not like the way this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| I do not agree with the way this particular one happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| I hope everyone hears that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| But to draw a box around it and say we're never, ever going to pay for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| yeah, that makes people cheer for you right now, but you might be setting the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| or another department up for a fall later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| I'm going to introduce a substitute motion that we defer this for 60 days to allow the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| human resources director, the other departments, get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| and bring us a document that we can all agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| And that, even if we don't all agree on, that we know has come from input from all of the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| that have a say in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| I'm sure this would be an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| There's another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| We can stay here and debate, and we do sometimes, for two or three hours on what happened when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:47| You buy a pair of jeans and you wear it until you wear a hole in the knee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| You either patch it or you throw it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| You don't sit and cry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| You put a patch on it and fix what's wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| We can't control what happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| All we can do is take the information we have from the past and make something that will work now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| So I would agree that we need to do something, and it may be that, as Commissioner McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| we do need to bring a couple more people in on this and get something that will look a little less harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:25| But I agree with the principle entirely, that anybody that when you go to work for the county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| the city government, particularly as a department head, most of those are political appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| And, you know, you might say, well, I'm guaranteed my job for two years or four years or whatever that term is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| but, you know, you're not promised eternity in that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| I hope everybody understands that I do realize that these are government jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| and that people serve at the pleasure of whoever happens to be sitting in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| These are public service jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| But these people are also taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| They're also our constituents, and they also deserve to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| And the bottom line is if we want to recruit and retain the best, then we are going to have to treat them well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:32| not treat them like they are royalty, no golden parachutes or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:41| but we at least have to be competitive with the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| or we're not going to be able to get the best people working for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| And I personally want the best people in our finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| I want the best people in our human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| I want the best people in our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| And I'm not saying that people need giant severance packages if they get fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:12| but, you know, three months' pay when you're getting downsized, as several have pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| is not unusual or unheard of even in county governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| And that's, I think, what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| And that's what I want to make sure that we don't tie our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| so that we're not able to take care of our people when they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| This all started, of course, with the severance package that was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:56| And, of course, I think most of us will agree that this was really shabby treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| of the individuals that were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| And there was an oral agreement that was reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| We weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| I mean, we weren't in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| We don't know exactly what was said or how it was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| But it was obvious that these people were effectively fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| but they technically resigned so that they got the severance package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| So, you know, my only problem with it was it's an oral agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| And you agreed, and we reneged on the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| And that reflects badly on us as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| But I honor Mr. Jarrett and his opinion about severance as being in bad practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| possibly for us from a legal standpoint as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| So, you know, and exactly what Sam said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| I mean, he states it well, as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| He thinks it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| And we've got to go back and look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Ms. Fogarty has told us that there are mitigating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| So we need to go back, take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| I wish there was something more that we could do for the people that we treated so poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| So I'll be supporting a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| It will be the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Frances, will 30 days give you enough time to look with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| You and the law director, do you need more time than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| I said 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| You said 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| I think we can find time within 60 days, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| And you'll get us a list of who's getting what or who has gotten what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Just to disagree with one thing that you said talking about Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| I don't think people come to Knox County work saying I'm going to work for Knox County because they've got a severance package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| You know, I think they come to work because they want to do the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| I don't think that's a perk as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Let me ask Ms. Frances another quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| You mentioned at least two elected offices, maybe three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Was there a concentration of these around January and February of 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| That makes me feel a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| I see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| MPC and PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| We do their payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Those are funded by, of course, by fees and by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| Yes, and we should point out that this is a list coming from our payroll department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| and these various entities may or may not be, you know, classified as Knox County government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| Because I would, an entity such as MPC, which is mutually funded by the city and county and fees, of course, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| We do their payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| We do their payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I would just question if we have the authority to say if you can do a severance or not do a severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| And I'll just finish by saying in 9% and 10% employment that is prevalent in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| and throughout the country, the average working guy out there thinks that three months severance is excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| and I agree with that, that it is excessive in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I'm well aware that there are probably entities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| In the survey I conducted, I didn't find any Tennessee counties, but they could very well exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| But, again, where you fall into problems and expose yourselves to claims of misfeasance in offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| when you have no codified uniformly applied policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| that leaves it to the individual discretion of anybody who is empowered to meet these things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| and that's where the danger is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Unfortunately, this particular scenario, there is no, I can't imagine it being legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| No, a judge could rule otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| However, if you're going to consider severance and working with Frances Ferguson is a joy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| because she's one of the top HR people in the country, that's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| We can certainly give you some options, but, again, the idea is it has to be codified clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| and concisely and uniformly applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| If there's discretion where the convenience of a certain department head to get rid of someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| or to avoid a sexual harassment suit, there's the danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| So, again, we'll certainly come back with something, at least give you some options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| and you could make a definitive decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| I just wanted to say that the report that I have that I had asked Frances for that she sent me on September 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| I forwarded to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| So that's all the information that I've had and I think that Frances was working from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:56| Mr. Law Director, this would apply to all Knox County employees, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| What about the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| What about the elected constitutional officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Well, again, because their power and authority is derived from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| we're going to have to look at each one individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| But generally, I was concerned with at-will employees especially of Knox County government per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| The other separate fiascos, again, their power and authority is derived from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| and the state, again, does provide for certain kind of severance if it's codified, it's uniformly applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| it's part of an operating procedure that has been unchallenged by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| So who would this apply to, just people under the mayor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Pretty much under the executive body of the county and commission employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:51| The motion on the floor is to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| If not, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Page 11, Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| extending by one month through October 31, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| the terms of the following members of the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| whose terms are expiring September 30, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Cynthia Stansel, District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Gene Teague, District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| John Schoonmaker, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| And Carson Daly, District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| We were supposed to have taken this up in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| and of course Commissioner Smith has already done his due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| but we're asking that this be done, extended 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| and in the meantime commissioners will be holding some meetings in their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| to bring us nominees for those individual districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| extending the billboard moratorium for an additional six months expiring March 31, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| We had an individual that wanted to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| If you'd like to come forward and give us your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| or perhaps two individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| I'm Danny Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| I reside at 4704 Meredith Road, Knoxville, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| If you don't mind, if I could pass out just a document that has two items, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| One of them I got at the end of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I think it will be of interest to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| Chairman, commissioners, I come before you today asking you to consider if this moratorium is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:39| By necessary I mean is extending this moratorium in the best interest of Knox County individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| businesses, and employees of those businesses in times of great economic struggles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| It is crucial that we not impose unnecessary burdens on businesses and employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| unless it is absolutely necessary to maintain the integrity of county services and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| I believe this moratorium is an unnecessary burden not only to my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| I am an employee and a partial owner of Outdoor Displays Advertising here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| I've been in business for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| But also to every business in Knox County that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| or potentially might use outdoor advertising as a means to promote their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| products, or directing customers to their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Not only does it adversely affect the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| but every employee or potential employee of those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| At a time when we have had record unemployment and business failures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| I would think that this body would be extremely sensitive to anything that might slow the growth of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| and new business starts in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Considering that this moratorium has had more than a two-year history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| please allow me to recap its timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| This moratorium originated in the September 22nd meeting of 2006, I mean 2008, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| over two years ago and was a 120-day moratorium on electronic billboards only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| It was to study the use of electronic billboards and receive public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| The next month on October 27th, 2008, it was broadened to be six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| and was for all billboards, digital and new, now including all permits pertaining to billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| So it went from a study of digital to a mass hold on all permits, whether new or reconstruction or any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| After a conversation with Mr. Pierce and the Knox County codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| anything that would have to be permitted, whether it's changing faces or anything now, has a moratorium on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| So it was broadened at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| On March 23rd, 2009, the moratorium was extended a second time for an additional six-month period to be studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:15| In the April 27th, 2009 meeting, the scope of the moratorium again was broadened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| to include electronically operating message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Once again, it was extended a third time in the September 28th, 2009 meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| for a six-month period to be studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| And still again on March 22nd of this year, the moratorium was extended a fourth time for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| Although the county has been studying this for over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| I have supplied you with two documents very pertinent to the argument of whether this moratorium extension is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| A phone conversation with Mr. Pierce of the Knox County Plans Examiner's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| and Lynn Weston of Region 1 of the Highway Beautification Office of the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| has allowed us to have some very beneficial statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| As you can see in the letter from Mr. Pierce's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| this is a listing of the history of permits for new billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Since 1990, there have been 78 permits for billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| That means over the last 20 years, there have been an average of just under four new billboards a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| These numbers show that the current billboard ordinances have been very effective in controlling new billboards in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| especially when you take into account the effects of a free market society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Economic rules and laws such as supply and demand help promote healthy growth patterns for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| Some would argue, including myself, that these ordinances were too restrictive prior to the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2031)|
| 0:34:02| We have billboards every year that are taken down due to road expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| private development of commercial property, residential development of subdivisions, and many other economic and social factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| To support this argument, let's take a look at the letter from the Highway Beautification Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| It shows that approximately 40 sign structures were removed in Knox County since January 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| These were not removed because of any governmental ordinance changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| These were removed through individual choices made by Knox County landowners and sign owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| These Tennessee Department of Transportation statistics do not include any signs removed from non-state maintained routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| These are just state maintained routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| So there's billboards on non-state maintained routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Mr. Ammons, you have a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Therefore, it can be assumed that more than 40 signs have been removed from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| How many, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| The county has no way of knowing or maintaining records of which billboards have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| We do know that Knox County has averaged four new signs per year and has had more than 40 removed over the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:12| Therefore, I ask the question to you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Is this moratorium really necessary after two years of study and does it benefit Knox County as a whole during these difficult times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| or is it just one more burden on an already crippled business environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| If you feel it necessary to continue the study for digital billboards, that is one type of an unnecessary burden in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| But to include all permitting, you move from a burden to a crippling effect to businesses in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| The question, I guess, is for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| So we have litigation pending on billboard use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| And so your recommendation to us is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| Well, we have ongoing litigation based on the constitutionality and it's a constitutional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| And the courts have consistently upheld the ability to have moratorium during pending litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| and to further investigate or otherwise examine these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| But it's clearly a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| So how familiar are you with the litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| I mean, specifically as regards the digital aspect versus, I mean, I'm not familiar with the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| I'm just, I just don't want us to go forward with something or say, well, I mean, I'm tired of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:44| I'm somewhat tired of this just proceeding without any definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| So I would like to have some kind of definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| But I don't, you know, I hear Mr. Ammons and I understand his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| and how this is, you know, this is regressive on his business or suppresses his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| But I don't want to, I also don't want to jeopardize anything from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| Well, you know, unfortunately we can't control the flow of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| We're trying to move it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| But, again, it's going to be based upon the ability of the courts and their dockets to push it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| But it could adversely affect our litigation if we don't maintain the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| You know, I'm on probably the opposite side of it from Mr. Ammons from a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| from a standpoint of sort of the beautification of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| And I think we have, I mean, I know that some billboards are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| and they're useful and they're reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| But given the state of where we are as far as I can see, that it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2273)|
| 0:38:02| And so I'll make a motion that this resolution go ahead as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| I just wanted to make one other statement because, and I understand where you're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| but also there's an implication that the study's been going on for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| The reason this has been going on so long is because it's Lamar that has the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| So it's being held up by the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| What we were going to do, and I'll make a disclosure that I am one of the founding members of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| but part of the reason it's been held up is we were trying to determine how to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| or how to regulate the electronic billboards as well as what to do about the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| I think this would have been resolved a long time ago, but once Lamar filed the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| we didn't want to pass a series of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| And it was the city of Knoxville's been involved in this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| They've had several workshops on it a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| and were really just following their lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| But once that lawsuit was found, was filed, I mean, we can't, there's nothing we can do until that gets resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:15| And I do support continuing the moratorium until we get some sort of legal opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:24| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Dr. Briggs and I are in agreement that we need to be somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| The question I have, though, arises out of if it's a moratorium on electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| I thought I got a flavor from the presentation that we somehow now have a complete moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| against regular old billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| And I think I heard him say we even have a moratorium now against permits to renovate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| So I know where we started because this has occurred since we've been seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| But I guess my question comes from has the moratorium grown and by what authority has it grown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| And I ask that of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| The only moratoria that have been approved have been approved by this body, Politic, in an open session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| Certainly staff, to my knowledge, no one is arbitrarily expanding that which the commission has approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:31| So would I be correct in saying that our moratorium, in conjunction with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| is against electronic billboards or electronic message boards, a combination of whatever flashing lights may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| But we do not have a moratorium in place against regular old billboards in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| or the renovation of regular old billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| I'm just trying to clear up within my mind what I'm thinking happened over the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| and then validate that with what's being presented to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| And, again, I'll wait on the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:23| I might go through some of these for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Mr. Chairman, move on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Commissioner Briggs, you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| I just wanted to make a comment because we were going to look at the whole billboard situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| because there's some billboards that aren't the electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| I think there's about, I believe there's six of them in Knox County right now that were there prior to this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:48| But also there was an issue, should we do something about the billboards that are not electronic billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| but they're constantly changing what the message is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| And part of the concern wasn't just the aesthetics, but also does it pose a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| And I know there was a lot of information available on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| whether they're a distraction to drivers and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| But we decided just to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And I'll be real honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| I don't think our intention was to block the renovation of existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| And if we want to address that as an amendment to this, I'd certainly be willing to listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| But that was not the original intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| My understanding with speaking with Mr. Pierce, and I'm assuming it came out of the October 27th of 2008 meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| it was broadened to include not only electronic billboards but new boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| And so from my understanding, at least from their office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| there has been for this time frame no permits allowed for renovation or change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| So, you know, I would ask that it be studied and looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| But at a bare minimum, if my understanding in the October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| you all changed the resolution to include those words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| and I would strongly support that if you want to study this further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| please go back and at least release business as it has been in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| apart from those electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Your resolutions presently, it started out with electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| You then extended it to all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| But in terms of billboards that are in disrepair, that need to be repaired, your resolution is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| As such, repairs can be made to existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| I was saying I think that's our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| But part of what we wanted to look at when we finally get this lawsuit resolved, and, you know, this is, to be quite frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| it's personally offensive to me is when I drive down I-40 from downtown out west is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| where you have all the billboards advertising adult entertainment, massage parlors, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| And I have had constituents asking me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| They're trying to explain to their six- and seven- and eight-year-olds, you know, what is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| And quite frankly, if I were drawing up regulations on that when we finally do get some sort of court ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| I think we certainly should have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Do we want that to be advertised along the way as you're driving on I-40 west in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| that this is what we're promoting in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Well, you know, and I guess I don't know what the law director is looking for specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| but I don't remember anything that came out of this body since I've been here saying that you could not replace a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:44| So I don't know if they're just acting on the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| the county commission sounds like they're against billboards, so they're kind of one-upping that or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| but I think that's what really needs to be looked at because I'm with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| I mean, that's something I'd be willing to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Your resolution, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Go ahead, go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Your resolution specifically reads accept existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| They're exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| So if a billboard goes down, they can put it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| What they can't do is take down, if a traditional billboard falls over, they can't replace it with an electronic billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| But they can make repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| They can maintain that, which they currently have, and if by an act of God or something to that effect, it's destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| So, again, it was never designed to deprive current owners of the use and enjoyment of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| So I think there's some good news for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| And I'll piggyback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| I guess one of the, you know, and advertisements, I think, set the culture of a community, of a country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:52| It's not just the explicit ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| You know, when I look at these workout facilities and there's a, you know, body up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| I mean, yeah, you know, it's there, but it's a legitimate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| But, like you say, having my eight-year-old ask me questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| So, you know, I think part of the responsibility comes back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| And I know you're just one small fish in the ocean there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| But at the same time, I do think we need to advertise responsibly, especially on large things like that, like a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| I can turn a TV off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| I can block a channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| I can't block that in my face, you know, as I drive to and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| For the record, if I might add, we've been in business for 15 years and we're a Christian organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| and we have, at least on our end, been responsible for no adult advertisement, no alcohol or tobacco, I mean, or tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| And I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| And I'm not directing it towards you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| It's just toward the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Given our discussion here, the fact that they can renovate and replace or whatever, repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| and the fact that we also need a more comprehensive look probably at billboards, the motion still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:16| I don't want to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| We've discussed this, you know, every six months when it did come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| And I believe at one time one of the things, and this is regarding what Commissioner Briggs said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| that we didn't have anything in there that they couldn't replace one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| I think we even talked about the fact if they had one on A Street that they were taking down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| they could put one on B Street if it qualified, you know, zone-wise and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| As long as we didn't have an increase, they were replacing one with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| That was in the discussion at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| But we do, you know, we need to get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| What's holding Lamar up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Is there anything we can do to light a fire on them to let this thing move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| It's a judiciary problem, not really a Lamar problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| They'd probably like to get this settled just as quick as anybody else, but it's, you know, how the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| We need to light some fires on some judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Let me make two statements and then a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| I think there isn't there a federal prohibition against tobacco on billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| So that was almost off the table anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| And I would question if we can legislate the quality of, quality is the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| as you go west about two miles from here and you bend I-40, there's sort of a, it's a Hooters knockoff ad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| a Mexican restaurant or something that's fairly provocative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| but I was wondering if we can, you know, be the moral patrol and say you can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| you can advertise a ride in the river boat, but you can't put a scantily clad cocktail waitress up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| That's irrelevant really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| But Dr. Briggs, the six digital billboards, are those just in the Knox County beyond the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:10| Just beyond the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I think they've been barred in the city, you know, going back a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| But this is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| I think they have been barred in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| They have been barred in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I don't think they can be rebuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| But I'm talking about just the electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I believe there's six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| You know, I looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| I was the original sponsor of this resolution, and I think at that time there were six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| There may have been already a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| I know because one of them I think went up after we passed this, but the permit had already been issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| but the construction had not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I know there's one right before you cross the line into Anderson County, and there's one down on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| There's one there around Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| There's several around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Brad probably knows where they are more than I do, and I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Chapman Highway is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| The one on Chapman is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| How about the one when you hit I-40 east, David, when you cross the bridge, have them on both sides, and it flips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| Is that city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| You have billboards on either side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| I don't think the city is on the other side of the river there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Well, the city goes along the interstate, but the property that's designed and signed is sitting on probably county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| Our motion is to extend the moratorium until March 31, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3029)|

| 0:51:05| That was my exact thought, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3067)|

| 0:51:33| Commissioner Andrews, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| I'd like to, if I could, first of all, make a motion to defer it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| just so we can go over it a little bit as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| It just got presented to us kind of last Friday when the agenda was downloaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| And so there are some things that we need to do, but I don't want to go too far as to over-litigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3112)|
| 0:52:01| I would like to do some things in this area with the help of other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| So if you guys would allow me the 30 days to review it and bounce some ideas off everybody, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| Motion is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3132)|

| 0:52:43| Yes, this is just a housekeeping ordinance when we were doing the committee on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| and we discovered that this was an ordinance comprising the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3168)|

| 0:53:03| So the law department wrote this up, taking care of that and making everything work the way it's supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3183)|

| 0:53:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Any other items to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Does anyone else want to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| I have two quick items for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| First, Commissioner Shouse and I are on the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| and at our last meeting we approved road projects for the coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| and the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| We asked them to give us a copy for Knox County projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| which we will give to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I think there are road projects in almost every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| that you might be interested in looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Secondly, John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Mr. Troyer, this budget report to the citizenry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| I was told that this is now online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Is this on the Knox County website as we speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| It should be, and it should be every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| We are working on an executive summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| and we certainly would welcome comments for improvements, suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| So we're trying to make that a little bit more user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| And so let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| So any citizen who would like to go to KnoxCounty.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| and you'll be able to download this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Commissioner Shouse, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Hugh Holt has asked that he contact me as Chairman of the newly organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| and reinvigorated Procurement Committee to schedule a meeting at 1 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| hour before our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| I think we meet at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| In front of me, I don't know exactly who's on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| Jeff's on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Jolie's got it, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| And I'll have Jolie send something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| We'd like to schedule a Procurement Committee just to go over the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| and regs and what that thing does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| and what's changed as far as the way they buy and sell things and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| So pencil in on your schedules if you're on the Procurement Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| and if you're not, please come October the 18th at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Commissioner McKenzie and I, he's going to think now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| what is it we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| That was a sinister laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| We are going to co-sponsor a discussion on sunshine at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| the discussion being whenever there is more than one commissioner at any one location at any one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:23| we put out public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| I wonder, since we are a new commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| and we're considered equal with other public entities in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| like the BZA or the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| I don't see them putting out forms like we put out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| And I'm asking the question of why that might be and what we have to do to be in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:58| There was an article in the paper Sunday about sunshine, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:06| I don't remember exactly what all was contained in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| I thought they were talking about Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| and that's a place where they definitely meet in other rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| I prepared a PowerPoint presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| an update on both ethics and open government and public records that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| And the chairman asked me initially, right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| to get that geared up for a future meeting of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| Yesterday I appeared before the – and it was Sunday because it was the – just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| I'm losing my mind over this flu shot, but that's my excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| But the school boards had a two-day retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Yesterday I presented an hour presentation on open government, government of the sunshine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| parliamentary procedure, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| But anyway, I'm available to do that for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| or in the alternative just be standing by to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| But I do have a formal presentation that outlines with specificity everything from a chance meeting to a one-on-one meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| to a lunch encounter, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| What if we did this at the chairman's lunch and that's the only item on the agenda in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| We could spend our whole lunch hour talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Would that be something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| I think that would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| And I guess also, you know, in the past we've heard that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| we as a body are under a harsher penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| It would be good if we could hear from you if that's how you feel about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| or if Chancellor Weaver's decision was basically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| reinforcing the fact that that body should have sunshine, those processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| Well, that expired October a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Well, you all are doing a workshop on sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| Commissioner Brown and I will do one on moonshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Commissioner Brown, are your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| And what flavor do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Baked apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| You all didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| First off, a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Thank the chairman for providing our lunch at the workshop today, lunch workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| And if we're going to continue that, I don't think it ought to be all out of your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| I don't know what your intention was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Is this a one-time only deal or do you want to do this every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| This was a one-time only deal for this month, but I would entertain any options that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| We have some people that have contacted us and said that they would like to provide lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| They're not going to do a meeting, but they said, hey, we'd like to provide lunch, and if it's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| I'd like to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| It will be well under the $35 per person limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Well, if we have a month where that, I mean, this seems to be kind of a productive time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| If we have a month that we don't have someone sponsoring it, then you'd have to tell us per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:55| if it's $10 a head, $5 a head, whatever it might be, that we could share in that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3595)|
| 1:00:04| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| So today we had a very productive time, but I think we only covered like maybe two or three subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:16| We were really pushed at getting to beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| It may be that as we deal with how we have time allotments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| It's not 4 o'clock now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| We'll be here until, I mean, the next scheduled part of this is at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| It may be that we may, after another meeting or so, begin to think about how we might realign our time slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| and maybe beer might push off a half hour because the lunchtime deal was really, really, really productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| I will be presenting to you a flow at our next meeting, just some suggestions for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Mr. Chairman, have we properly introduced our newest commissioner and welcomed him to the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Would you like to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| You all got your paddles ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Yeah, I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| Has he paid his membership dues yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| He buys lunch next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Joe Lee will send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| I just wanted to welcome Mr. Jeff Owenby from the 4th District and good to have you with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Also, thanks to the staff, to Jill and Joe Lee, Drusilla, and the ladies in the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you all for the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3698)|

| 1:02:13| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3733)|

| 1:02:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3735)|

| 1:02:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3737)|

| 1:02:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3739)|

| 1:02:21| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| All commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| We have basically four items on the agenda for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| This is the first time I have chaired one of these meetings, so I will make several mistakes during the course of the next while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| So I ask for your indulgence that you will give me your patience and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| I would ask that as you come to the podium and speak, and a number of you I'm sure will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| we would ask that you be succinct in your comments and please adhere to the time requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| The other thing I would ask, too, is that if someone is speaking in opposition to your point of view, that you be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| Just because someone disagrees doesn't mean that we need to be disagreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| And so I'm going to ask you to please maintain proper decorum for those who may be speaking in opposition to your point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| So, clerk, let's get started with the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| On page 12, 8D10RZ, request of Linda Hurt for rezoning from A Agricultural to RA Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| Property located northeast in Messer Lane, northeast of Weaver Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Yes, would you come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Is this per MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Per MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| You're approved, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| 8E10RZ, request of Hunter Valley Farm for rezoning from A Agricultural to T Transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| Property located northwest side of Hunter Valley Lane, east of Keller Bend Road in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| I'm the attorney for the applicant, and we would ask approval per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| Mr. King, you're in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I'm not here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| This matter was subject to a USUN review, and that USUN review has been approved, and this was just the follow-up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| So I'm just here as an interested observer, not opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| So is there any opposition at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| I recommend we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| 8C10SP, request of Bob Gage, GBT Relative Corporation for northeast county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| from LDR Low Density Residential to NC Neighborhood Commercial, or RC Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| Property located southeast of Rutledge Pike, northwest side of Shiptown Road in the Eighth Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| Mr. Chairman, there is an or in there, and I would take out the or and approve the rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:31| Is that acceptable to you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| What we were requesting at the original MPC meeting was a rural commercial on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| and CR on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Does MPC like to, do you all want to weigh in on this, Buzz or Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Kenneth Church, 511 Union Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, the staff did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| and it was confirmed by commission that the property, the plan designation be changed to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| We felt like that was more appropriate at this location since you already had a neighborhood commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| around the interchange there at Shiptown and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| The rural commercial is a little bit more expansive in terms of the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| and we felt like this was more appropriately designated as a neighborhood commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| So with those comments, we didn't feel like the rural commercial was appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| There are other zones around in the area that could support the rural commercial type uses, commercial designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:46| So the staff and, again, the commission felt like the neighborhood commercial was more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| and therefore recommended approval of neighborhood commercial at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| The difference between the two is I've been, let me back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| I need to make a statement of disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I have no personal interest in this property, but I have been contacted by my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| and also namely the property owner asking for my support of his position so that he can sell this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| and Dollar can build on this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| The difference between the two zoning codes for this particular builder or this particular commercial usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:40| revolves around what is the size of the square feet of the store, whether it be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| and I don't have the particular numbers in front of me, whether it be 5,000 square feet or 9,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:54| The smallest store that Dollar puts up is 9,100 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| They can take this neighborhood commercial, which is limited to 5,000 square feet, I think that's correct, or thereabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:13| and go to the Board of Zoning Appeals and ask that it be changed to 9,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| My concern was that this is a three and a half acre piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| and that the developer wanted to build in one corner and expand off in another direction with other buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| They want to build only one stand-alone store in the middle of it or however you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| I think there's plans, proposals that are offered here to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| The thing that I'm looking toward is that it's going to be a 9,000 square foot store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| It might as well be rural commercial and it's over with tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| So that's the reason I was taking the neighborhood commercial away and just saying it's going to be rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| If there needs to be something added to it about setbacks and foliage and lights and all that sort of stuff, we can add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:11| The difference between the size store that is allowed or the size building allowed in neighborhood commercial is limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:22| as far as size as what rural commercial could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| 5,000 square foot versus this particular store needs to be their smallest, which is 9,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:35| All of that's contained there in what they've sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| So your recommendation or your motion is to make it RC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Oh, we have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Next item that goes along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| On page 13, 8G10RC, request of Bob Gage, GBT Realty Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| for recent information on agricultural to see our rural commercial property located southeast side of Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| southwest side of Shop Town Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| For a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Or M.C. or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Yes, Buzz, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Mr. Chairman, going back to the plan amendment, because of the change in state law in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:31| the authority of the legislative body, county commission, with regard to a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| is to make operative a plan amendment adopted by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| The planning commission did adopt neighborhood commercial as the land use classification here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| Having said that, you have the authority to initiate your own plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| but you can't change the planning commissions on the fly like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| So would we just have to recommend that you guys go back and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| In order to do what Commissioner Wright wants to do, I think you would have to postpone the zoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| Now, the zoning, we considered both, so you have both of those zone districts in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| That's no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| You're dealing with the plan amendment that was adopted by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| So one way to move forward would be to postpone the zoning, come back and initiate your own plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| that goes to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| It would come back to the legislative body, and you could ignore the advice of the planning commission if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| But we do have to honor the process that was set up in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| So, Mr. Jerry, what would be the proper wording for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| I think, you know, in an abundance of caution, the prevailing side should essentially vote in such a manner as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| afford yourselves the opportunity to send an amended plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| So recall what we just voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| So we need someone from the, well, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Everybody was prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| I'd like to make a motion that we take up the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Motion is aided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| So this, we will not be able to get CR zoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| We'd have to come back another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Mr. Donaldson, would you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| I believe he's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| We can't do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| Unless CR zoning is consistent with neighborhood commercial plan, and Buzz is shaking his head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| The test is that any rezoning has to be consistent with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| So we need to make the plan what you desire first and then get the zoning consistent with what has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| So it's going to take multiple steps here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| But if we left it at the recommendation of CN, we could go to the Board of Zoning Appeals to get a larger size building on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:12| That would be our next step if we left it at CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| You would have the right to apply for a variance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| That would be a month away, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| I mean, either way, we're looking at a month away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| That would be next, it would be for the month of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I mean, we're looking at a six-day difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| And we meet first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| We could give him four or five days, or three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| Three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| We would come back to this body, not to MPC, for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| The state law also has a defined 30-day time period before considering a plan amendment at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4433)|
| 1:14:04| So I don't know that we can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| It would be November before the Planning Commission can consider your initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| And then that would put it to December for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| I wonder why nobody wants to build in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| Well, my client said that if all we could get was CN tonight, that we would go with CN, then we'd have to go to BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:37| And then going to BCA, we're going to be going from 5,000 to 9,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| Putting off until November is really delaying the track that they're on for turning the property and getting construction started on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| It would be November before you can go to BCA, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| If CN is approved tonight, Knox County BCA, our deadline is in a couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4497)|
| 1:15:07| and then the hearing will be before the end of October, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| So we would be able to get, if we got a BCA for a 9,100 square foot building in CN, then that would, we wouldn't have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:23| Do you want to try that method first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| I'd prefer to try that method right now instead of delaying this any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| So basically we were looking at taking no action tonight and you just taking it on to BCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| No, we need to do the second plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Take action and adopt what MPC has recommended, CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| And then we would go for BCA based on CN and then just hope that we wouldn't have any opposition there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| CN zoning as it stands now, we can divide that property in two and put two 5,000 square feet buildings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| CR is from the standpoint of setbacks and based on vegetation that we have to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| it's actually more restrictive than the CN parking and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| We'll just go with CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| We'll use those setbacks and we'll just go for a variance on the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| That's NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Our clerk has just told us it's NC and not CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| The second plan designation is CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| The zoning is NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| The other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| I don't even know what's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| I wonder why the citizens are confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| You're confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| So what motion, Mr. Law Director, would be proper for us to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| Well, I'm trying to discern exactly what relief this gentleman is seeking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| but I want to make sure that we're in consonance with the MPA protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| What we were looking at, we wanted 9,100 square foot building and CN limits it to 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| Then CR, you can put a 20,000 square foot building on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| We just want to go 9,100 square feet and not want to have to go through the process of going to BCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| so that we can go ahead and get the plans in next month, the first of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| As it stands, we can't put the plans in until we go to BCA, which will be the latter part of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| If we have to wait and go back through this whole process again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| again, it's going to be November or December, and we still don't have our plans in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| and that puts the whole construction on the project way behind the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| We'd like to do it clean, so the only way we can do this now is go CN and request to BCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| and then just hope that we don't have any opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| So it sounds like I can make a motion that we approve this per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| We'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| That would be the cleanest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| Mike, the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| If he's turned down at BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| We've got to start this process all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| The action you're about ready to take closes the door on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| His recourse now is to go to BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| I just wanted to be sure that you know that if it's a crapshoot for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| Oh, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| If you lose the BCA, you've got to go back to MPC and start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Let me ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| We have to have both the sector plan and the rezoning together tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| We can't just do a rezoning and not the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| Let's throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Both of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| The way the recommendation from MPC was you'd be voting for neighborhood commercial on both the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Well, let's just go with CN right now and we'll take the crapshoot of going to the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| We have a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4742)|

| 1:19:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Good luck, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4749)|

| 1:20:04| I've got a point of order on the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| I think we voted to reconsider the first, which was 10SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:17| And we voted on that, but we did not vote on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| Yeah, I don't think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Just to be clean, I think we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| 8G, 10RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4825)|

| 1:20:35| 8H, 10RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Request that Pebbleston Condominiums HOA for rezoning from RB General Residential and A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| Property located southwest side of Murfree Road, southeast of Tazewell Park in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| Any applicants here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Any opposition to this 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Robert, I've just got a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Is that just an extension of what's already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| Is that like phase two of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| We had to convert this to a PUD from a condominium because of the banking regulations, the way they've changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| the financing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| So, yes, it's to bring everything in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Mr. Chairman, make a motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Hey, Robert, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| When this hillside stuff pops up, you know, of course, there's some antennas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| Can you tell us just a little bit about the protection area and what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| Yeah, and I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| I know the hillside regulations, how they're written from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| But on this site, we have slopes that are probably somewhere in the 5% to 7% range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| The only part that I would consider, again, East Tennessee Mountain Boys sometimes has a little different definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| but there's a part going down into kind of a ravine that runs beside the property, a creek that's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| That's all in a buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| That's the only part of the property that goes into that 12% to 15% steepness range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| The rest of the property has already been graded out a long time ago, A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| And B, even in its natural state, was probably only in that 5% to 7% maximum range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| So I think the part is over where this ravine or creek runs by the property under a powerline easement that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| is already in a buffer zone that we've not touched, never will touch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| is the part that probably makes that hillside classification an accurate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Now, this project's been ongoing since 1995, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| No, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| So I've slipped since then, but I'm pretty sure that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| And I haven't had any calls about it, so obviously there's not too great a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| It's pretty well built out except for the last piece, but that's been graded out for a couple years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| And now because of the banking regulations, he's wanting to build that part, but he can't do it until he gets this thing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| And then my only other question is related to the area where the stream is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Are there any feeder tribs that are coming tributaries into that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| This feeds into Murphy Creek later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| This creek runs under Tassel Pike, so it's a single line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| There might be one small one, but it's off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| But it's a very small, and I don't even know if it's not very long if it even starts over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| It's pretty much at the headwaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Let's go back to 810-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| This is request of Bob Gage, GBT Realty Corporation for rezoning from agricultural to CR rural commercial property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| southeast side Rutledge Pike, southwest side of Shiptown Road in the 8th Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| For MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Commissioner Norman, did you want to ask any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Any questions about this at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| 2810-SAP, request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to adopt the amended East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| What I'd like to do on this is to ask our law director to reiterate a memo that he sent to all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| just so we have that fresh on our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| I'd like to ask MPC to give us your report and then we'll hear those who are in favor and those who may be opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| So, Mr. Jarrett, if you would reiterate your memo to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, just to reiterate, as you know, you're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| You have before you the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| and I know that there's been a lot of public interest and a lot of media interest that it seems to be separating the Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| project or industrial park and treating it separately and distinctly from your East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| What you're here today is to either approve the plan as submitted or, on the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| if you wanted to delay this so you have an opportunity to send back an amended plan to MPC relative to a certain portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:22| like Midway, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| But, again, this is one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| The overall issue is the East County Sector Plan, a component of which is the Midway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| and I'll defer to MPC if they want to enlighten you any further on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| Buzz, if you and Mark would like to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| Well, again, I would just reiterate that before you is the plan amendment that has been adopted by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| and your job tonight is to make it operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| If you want to amend it, you can do that through your own initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5154)|
| 1:26:03| This has been a very long planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| I think the first documented meetings were in the summer of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| and then basically we've boiled down to consensus on 99% of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| with the 1% being the Midway Interchange Business Park area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:23| But the plan respects the 2001 Knoxville-Farragut-Knox County Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| Fifty-five percent of the land within the East County Sector is designated as rural in that growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| and that is reflected in the plan and kept intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| The plan calls for future residential, commercial, and business development concentrated in nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| and along highway corridors within the urban and planned growth areas of the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| The plan is balanced to manage development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| Future residential, commercial, and economic development activities are concentrated in those nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| tied to the transportation system within the urban and planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| And the plan recommends design overlay districts for highway corridors to manage signs, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| access, and building design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| The plan recommends the preservation of rural character of the majority of the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| Again, the rural designation is respected and kept intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and the plan recommends the creation of a French Broad conservation corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| with recommendations of about 5,000 acres in the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| with a corresponding similar size across the river in the South Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| The plan recommends looking at creating a new agricultural zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| to more accurately divide the existing land uses into two districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| a true ag district and perhaps something that we might call a rural residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| It recommends the use of the transfer or purchase of development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| and the use of new conservation subdivision regulations as a way to preserve rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| The plan does reflect the public input received during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| It reads with regard to the preservation of the French Broad River interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| It reads that the location of a sewage treatment plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| in the French Broad conservation corridor is not recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| And with regard to tourism-related economic development strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| the plan states that these concepts merit further considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| particularly in the French Broad conservation corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| and especially in places close to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| With regard to the Midway Business Park recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| it devotes an entire appendix, Appendix D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| to document the changes requiring and changes necessary to the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| meeting the criteria necessary to make that plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| And keep in mind that the existing sector plan land use designation at Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| is currently low-density residential, up to five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| or the area within the planned growth area north of I-40 at the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| and that the transportation and environmental impacts of residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| at five units per acre and office development right at the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| which is currently called for, would be significantly more intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| than the proposed business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| With that, I will rest, and we've got Mike Carberry and Jeff Archer here as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| to answer any questions about specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| Do we have those who would like to speak in favor of the resolution as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| In other words, amending the East County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| and adopting by resolution the plan as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| Do we have any who would like to speak in favor of the resolution as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| Yes, go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| If you would come to the podium and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| My name is Todd Napier with the Development Corporation of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| We are in favor of the plan as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| and here to answer any questions that you may have in relation to our intended use at Midway Interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| Commissioners, do you have any questions for Mr. Napier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| Mr. Napier, I spoke with Mike Edwards recently about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| and he mentioned the fact that I don't remember this being brought out before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| about the greening of this particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| the fact that you were planning bike trails, walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| a passive community type park situation, not ball fields and major things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| Can you elaborate on some of that as far as what are in the plans for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| Just to back up just for a second, but to answer your question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| tonight what you're considering is a land use designation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and as it presented, it would allow for a business park use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| and in that it specifies an employment center zoning, which is a plan use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:58| Before we could even get rezoned to use the property for that use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| we would come back with very detailed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| But the general concept right now and what we've laid out are basically walking trails along all the developed roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:15| and then making use of the natural features, primarily some drainage ways to do natural trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| even having some parking areas to allow people to come there that don't live in immediate vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| to park and to use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| So it would provide access to the property that currently the public does not have, nor have they ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| So I believe it would be an asset for the community from a passive recreational standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| I realize that you can't finalize those until you get some of this approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| but this development, just like any other, has a lot of stories that get started, good and bad, on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:58| And it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| What I'm trying to do is try to bring some of this to the front so that everybody kind of knows what your plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| One, I know one of the main drawbacks were that the community was afraid that you were going to put in a sewer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| that would be encompassing the rest of the neighborhood out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| I know from what, speaking with you all, what your plans are, but would you go over those again, if you would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| As far as the wastewater system goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| The intent would be to develop an on-site wastewater treatment system that would serve the business park properties alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| We have plans that would develop a capacity up to about 200,000 gallons per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| That would all have to be permitted and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| And so it would be treated on-site and then disposed of via drip irrigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| I've got someone here, Mike Hines with Southeast Environmental Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| If you've got some detailed technical questions about that, he can answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| But ultimately the system would be operated by KUB, but it would be limited to just the business park itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:19| Well, from what we were told before, the biggest reason, well, not the biggest reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| but one of the major factors as far as expanding that would be the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| It would cost something like $11 million to take it outside that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| To do a regional wastewater treatment plant, we looked at, KUB did several studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| but, yes, it would be cost prohibitive and we believe we can do what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| and serve the business park itself with a much less expensive wastewater system that I described previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:58| And one of the things that we have commented on, and Mike just reminded me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| that we will restrict those who can use this wastewater system to those within the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Todd, I'm going to just throw a couple of questions out, which we've all heard before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| and I would speculate that when the other side gets up to offer their side of the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| they'll put this on the table also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| There's also a lady, I don't know who she was, had a column, Saturday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| Why do you not think, do you just not have the capacity, I'm looking at the parks we have now, underutilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| East Bridge, West Bridge, Folks River, which I'm very familiar with, which is very unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| and I know it's underutilized, but very unique, has rail, barge, everything but an airport virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| And this big piece of land out there in the Blount County, which I believe we've got $5 million in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| I don't know what it's called, Pellissippi Park or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| It's a beautiful place, big place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Just tell me why those don't work and why you still need additional capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| We have about 370 acres in Knox County of Development Corporation Industrial Development Board property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:25| that we can market to and use for expansion and recruitment of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:33| That's just not very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| About half of that is located out in East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| And I always like to say we've had some very good companies out there, but it has been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| It's 12 miles to interstate from that business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| West Bridge, we have about 10 acres left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| Let me talk to you a minute about Pellissippi Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| because I think there's a whole lot of misunderstanding about what that is and what it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| It's 450-acre development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| 230 acres of that are research park is what they call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| The rest of it is residential and retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| To go into that business park, which Knox County invested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| a user has to have 40% of its jobs have to be classified as research jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:26| scientists, technicians, in order to even go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| If you don't have that, you can't go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| And they project that's a 50-year development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| That is very specific, and that's very difficult to count in the inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| of what we've got for those very specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| We do not have a lot of property left in order to compete with other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| You don't have to look very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Chattanooga has five times as much as we have, and that's just two hours down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| I didn't bring my notes up here with me, but I think I've shared those with you, what other communities have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| One thing that I am certain of, and I've heard this many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| is that if you do not have property or a building that meets a company's needs, it's very easy to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:20| It's just that fundamental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Either you have a product that meets their needs or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| If you don't, you don't compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| It doesn't matter how great your workforce is, how great your hospital system is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| if you just can't meet that basic requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| And that's part of what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:44| And so we don't, I wouldn't even report that you could wait until you're completely out of property before you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:53| I've used this example before, but if you're a retailer and you sell clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| you can't wait until you have one style of clothing and one size and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| you get down to that level of inventory and say, I wonder why nobody's coming into my store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| It's because you don't have a selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| So not only do we, we can't wait until the very end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| we continue to have to have a variety of products in order to attract a variety of types of companies and projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| That Pellissippi would satisfy the immediate access to the interstate, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| For that very narrow type of company that I defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Mr. Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| Yeah, this may have been discussed in the month before or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| How many companies would disqualify us or take us off the blocks for having septic and not sewage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:49| With the type of wastewater system we're talking about, it's not a septic system, but it's an on-site treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| So it's primarily going to be companies, in some ways we would be disqualifying them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=5996)|
| 1:40:04| that are very large generators of wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| So if you are a significant, say, food processing company that generate a lot of wastewater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:16| when we're building a system up to 200,000 gallons per day, so that's one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| or one that may have a high BOD load, it would be biological oxygen demand load,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| you'd have to really pre-treat that and pre-treat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| So it may be cost prohibitive for them to do that or metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| So the level of pre-treatment that might be required on a system of this size would preclude certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| So I can't give you an exact percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| We went through kind of early on and looked at our existing mixture of companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| and it's somewhere around 80% of those companies could go into their existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| Parks could go into this one on that type system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| But certainly there's some that would not, and we would not recommend that they go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| We would try to steer them toward perhaps each fridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| But these are going to be smaller companies that are going to employ smaller people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| No, no, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| It just has to do with wastewater generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| You can employ hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| It just has to do with whether or not you've got a wastewater as part of your process that is of strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| and volume that wouldn't be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Todd, I know some of the answers to these questions, but I want to kind of ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| because I think there's some public perception that's probably a little bit incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| If this sector plan change was approved tonight, what would be your next step in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:47| The next step would be to refine and work toward a more defined site plan in order to get employment centers zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:58| Once you had that in place, it would define, and what we define there is how the lots would lay out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| how the roads would lay out, what the landscaping would look like, building materials, building types, sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| Then we could move toward actual design and construction plans, which would be then bid out, constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| So even if it was approved tonight, you're two, two and a half, three years out from really having product in order to sell and offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:30| This is really just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| Although we've bought the land and I've shared with you publicly and privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| the process that we bought the land was probably a little bit flawed public relations wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| And I think that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| What plans does, of course, I'm going to sit on the board of the development corporation next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| and I think the mayor, if he's not on there, he'll have an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| What plan does the chamber and the development corporation have to include all interested parties in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| We've talked about that quite a bit of recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| And what we can and are willing to do is to certainly say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| if you're only coming to the table to say that business park is not something we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| then that's not a position of negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| That's yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| But if we have that basic framework of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| then we would certainly be willing to and are willing to engage folks in meaningful design elements of the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:41| and how it relates internally but also externally to the properties around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| And a lot of people talk about the property that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| I'm just going to kind of, this is not a question for you, Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| but in our district we have West Bridge Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| We have the Hardin Valley Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| We have Pellissippi Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| And we've made a lot of progress in corporate center especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| We have NTSB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| We have, I may have got the initials wrong, but we have ADT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| We have what was Brinks is now another company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| So we've made a lot of progress out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| And I think that, you know, you say you have ten acres left in West Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| Of course, we've got some empty buildings, but the development corporation don't own those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| and we can't control those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| And I think it's important that Knox County broadens its tax base with business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:44| And I don't know that, you know, this is not the end all be all of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| but, you know, if we keep saying no to business development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| eventually it comes out of our pocket as individuals, as property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| as people that, you know, we expect a certain level of government service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6296)|
| 1:45:03| and yet when it comes to doing the right thing for the county, we're not willing to pay the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| You're either going to pay for it now or you're going to pay for it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| And if we can't bring businesses to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| then you either cut services drastically or you raise your property taxes drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| And there's things in this county, you know, we've had opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| and things to various projects in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| and we've talked to the school board about new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| Ladies and gentlemen, if we don't broaden our tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| we're not going to have these new schools without excessive taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| And so I think we need to really either you can agree or disagree whether or not we need a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| but if the park is approved, I think we need to work together to do a good business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| and to remember that it's a county wide project, it's not a district project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| or it's not a six district project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| I think we need to be careful that we're against everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| because eventually you're going to have to be for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| You know, this is one of those projects that I think we all struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, this is, you know, kind of has a lot of emotional attachment to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| and we all have been involved in it in one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:25| even though those of us that maybe knew, I'm sure they ran on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| and I'm sure they were asked a question during that election process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| What would it mean if this did not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| What, you know, in terms of the future and the potential to have additional marketing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:54| I don't think what it would mean would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| certainly in the very near term limit our ability to market ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| or actually even be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Part of it is if you don't have inventory, you're not considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| I mean, the information is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| So we would be limiting ourselves to our ability to attract companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| and potentially even retain companies that needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| that wanted to be in this area but had other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| So potentially we'd lose projects to our competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| Huntsville, Alabama is always competing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| Lexington, Greenville, South Carolina constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| And I, you know, believe that we would be sending a message that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| this is not something that we do not want light manufacturing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| That's not where our future is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| And if that be the case, then that be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| But I really think that would be flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| I think, you know, manufacturing is the backbone of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| And if we do not continue to manufacture things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| we can't just sell to each other or resell things we buy from overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| We've got to support that nationally and locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| And it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| This is a base type business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| And the wages and the multipliers for manufacturing are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| So one thing I think it will impede our process ability to attract companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| and it clearly sends their own message as to what, you know, what we want in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| And you mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| I know you don't have the information with you, but you mentioned Chattanooga as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| Not counting the Volkswagen square footage, they still have a significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:42| So I think that's on 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| It can't be quoted, but I'm close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| I'm close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| I think it's about 1,500 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| There's another 1,200 acres in that general facility that can be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| And I think they're working on currently in order to have industrial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| So if you carve out Volkswagen, they still, they're way above our present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| And I do have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| I'd have to go pull them out of my bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| And, again, I am struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| It's an active process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| So I think what you said is, and what Commissioner Anders said, everyone has to understand those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:32| We will be sending a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| Make no mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| I mean, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| But if we say no here, prospective businesses, other cities will take that message that we're sending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:51| And so that, to me, is the one, I think, piece that we need to keep in the forefront of our thoughts if we go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6591)|
| 1:50:04| You know, if we want to grow as a county, if we want to grow the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| there's only, you're right, there's only a few number of ways that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| So I don't know where people are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| But if the answer to this is no, we best be coming up with an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:26| It can't be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| We won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Yippee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| Because a year or six months or whatever down the line, there's going to be some extremely tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| and difficult decisions that's going to fall to this body and ultimately to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| Those of you who perhaps are in opposition to what you're hearing, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| You're going to get your chance to speak, and I'm counting the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| So you're going to get your opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| I'm going to give the commissioners an opportunity to ask their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Mr. Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| Next, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| The East Sector Plan preparation has been around as long as I've been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| The first meetings were actually in Mr. McKenzie's district in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| I think we then found out it was probably Carter where the people lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| So there have been several meetings at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| Even one meeting at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| And the only remaining disagreement or point of consideration is revolving around this business part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:45| What I need to say and what I think we'll hear from other people standing up is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| an industrial business does not fit well in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:58| We've been waiting, we, Knox County Commission, we've been waiting for a new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| And I think at that same time we also said we were waiting for a new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:11| And I see that Mayor Burchett is in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| and I would like to ask if we could sort of have a transition now between the fors and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| I'd like to hear what the incoming administration of Knox County might think of this idea that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| Would it be okay for us to call on him at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| Mayor Burchett, would you like to address commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| Tim Burchett, 6401 Airtree, Mayor, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:56| And I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| You can restate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| From the point of view of Knox County Commission, we have dealt with this for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| And at the last time we did any dealing with it, we placed it in abeyance until a new commission was seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:15| and new administration of the county was brought into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| And I'm asking you, you're going to be around for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| We're all going to be around for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| I think I know where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Well, I think what we're really focusing on here is jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| This is about jobs and the type of jobs and the quality of jobs we're going to recruit to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| And I see both sides of it, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| I see the fact that we've got to bring in these industrial jobs for our tax base, which is obvious in this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:52| I don't think we can be turning any down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| And obviously, we don't have the amount of property that was, I think, Commissioner McKenzie referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| that's congruent or adjacent to or that fits the topography of a Volkswagen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| but what we do have is individual areas that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| And to be honest with you, I've had one official meeting, and that was, well, with the community this morning, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:23| And I would, at some point, I'm not the one to make the motion, but I would sure like to have 60 additional days to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:32| And I know you all would like to put some structure involved with that and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| but I could come back to you and give you a better educated answer, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:45| Mr. Chairman, based on the comments of the new mayor of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| I would like to propose that we defer our discussion of this east sector plan for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6891)|
| 1:55:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| If I might interject something, we're talking about framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| and I know that you had talked about the idea of having some structure to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| Just simply delaying for 60 days is just kind of going to swirl things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| If we could have some type of structure where we have public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| perhaps your office would spearhead those in conjunction with commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| so that we know that we're going to have some scheduled type of meetings to talk about what to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| Would that be something that would be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| As a matter of fact, that's an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| Just brainstorming right here, if we could have the folks at the chamber at the table also, of course, to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:44| I think there's a certain structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| When I say structure, there's a framework of what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| but there's actual nuts and bolts of what's going to be on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| and I think that they need to be at the table to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| because if we come back and say we're going to grow bamboo out there and we all agree to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| and that's something that they're not for, I think we're just wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| So I think we should make sure that that's at the table, and I think that's a great idea, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| So, Commissioner Wright, if you had a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| it would be that the mayor's office set up structured public hearings, perhaps three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| or do we want to put a number on it over the next 60 days, two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| I think two would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| We can meet to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| I think we're going to end up being the same folks saying the same things on both sides every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| and I think we could probably draw some sort of conclusion after a couple of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| So it would be two meetings, two public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| And that would give us enough time to the public announcement, I mean, to get it in the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| and let them know when we're happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| So does the second agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Let's move on with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| Could I make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| I would make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| The only bone of contention here is the business part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| MPC has worked long and hard and sweated over this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| Everybody I think that I've talked to, at least out there, has tickled 99% with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| I'd like to make a motion that we carve out, if we're going to postpone anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| to carve out the Midway part, approve the sector plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| No, sir, you'd have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| Because you're dealing with the sector plan and Midway is a component thereof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| you're going to have to look at it as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| I mean, if you want to send back an amended plan to MPC whereby you remove that, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:45| Again, you're looking at it, the Midway is not a separate entity unto itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| It is part of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| There is no substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| No, I'm sorry, you made a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| No, no, you can't make a substitute motion, according to our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| I don't think there's one person out here tonight that's here in reference to this sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| that's not probably been to two, three, or four meetings already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| I know I've personally been to three where the plans were presented, discussions were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:24| I don't know if there's anyone here that hasn't been out there tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| We put this thing off four months ago to give everyone a chance to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| You know, quite frankly, I think that everyone's minds, everyone out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| their mind is made up they're either for or against this thing and it's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| And I would dare say that everyone on this commission has made up their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| If they haven't, they haven't been paying attention to what all has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| I'd like to comment on that, if I may, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| There's new members to the Development Corporation Board and there's a total new administration that I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:05| I mean, as much as I'd like to vote on it tonight and get rid of it and do, you know, make sure that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| I say get rid of it, it's probably a bad term, but as much as I would like to vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| I think it's only fair that the new Development Corporation Board meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| and I think it's fair that the new administration has an opportunity to put their input on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| We have a motion, substitute motion on the floor. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| I beg your pardon. No, I take my second back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| Substitute motion, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Substitute motion is to approve to vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Motion fails for lack of a second. Mayor Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| I was just wanting a point of clarification. Are we, Dr. Briggs is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| His substitute motion failed for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Okay. Thank you. I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| Commissioner Olenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| I'm sorry, Commissioner Briggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| Well, quite frankly, I'll turn my light off because I don't think there's need to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| It's going to be a couple of months until we vote on this, so just to save everybody time, I think we ought to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7208)|
| 2:00:16| I wish we had done this right when we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| We'd saved another, last time we talked about an hour and a half and then said we weren't going to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| We've talked another 40 minutes tonight and said we're not going to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| So I think we ought not do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| Commissioner Norman, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| I'm for doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| Okay. We have a motion on the floor, but those of you who, does anyone else want to speak on this that is in opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:47| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| My name is Elaine Clark. I reside at 8003 Thorngrove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| You all have all heard me in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| And I support the new administration's delay for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| I would love the opportunity to talk with the new administration and the new commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| and see if we can come to something that would be equitable to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| Anyone else want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| We have a motion on the floor, a 60-day deferral with two public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| which would be orchestrated by the mayor's office, including the chamber, including commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| and of course anyone else that they would feel appropriate to bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| Any opposition? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| 6C10RZ. Appeal by Arthur G. Seymour, Junior Attorney for CGK, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7303)|

| 2:02:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| And I believe there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| So Mr. Seymour, you have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| If I may very briefly, I want Todd Kennedy, the applicant, to come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| but I want to tell you what we're asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Can I hold on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| NPC, do you want to give us your report before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Let's do the NPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| What you have before you is an appeal of a rezoning application for CR rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:37| It's located at the intersection, near the intersection, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| on the southeast side of Fox Road, northeast of Catten-Holler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| The size of the tract is three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| I might point out that a companion sector plan amendment was also denied by NPC for rural commercial designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:58| and I'll get back to that here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| But the request for CR rural commercial zoning was denied for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| This is a location that is not directly at an intersection of a collector or arterial street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:16| which would be a preferred location for this type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| This is a case where, and you've heard this term used from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| this is a case that would be a classic example of spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| where you have a commercial designation or non-residential designation location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:35| where properties in the surrounding area would not have the same benefit for development as the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7415)|
| 2:03:43| There is some access issues with regard to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| The fact that it, if developed with commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| would also be there with traffic from a marina that's located directly to the east of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7434)|
| 2:04:02| The traffic with the marina is already problematic, and this would only add to that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| There's a location relative to a railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| Crossing would be, could be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| And, again, the approval of the request would have the potential of adding more vehicle trips to Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:24| There's nothing that we could find that caused the staff to see that this was an appropriate rezoning at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:33| It is proposed use would be for a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| and marine rental that would, to some degree, complement the marina next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7476)|
| 2:04:46| I think it's no secret, and we mentioned in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| that even though staff might not be in favor of this request or this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:57| that if this were to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| a better option or a better proposal would be to try to combine the marina to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:08| with the restaurant and marine sales that are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| Obviously, there are issues with that in terms of property ownership and how that would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| But you would not have to change the zoning of the property to a zone that would allow other kinds of commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| besides a restaurant and marine rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| And you would also have the possibility, because that particular scenario would require review of a site plan by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:35| where we could take a look at how such a use would work on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| And it could be that we could make proposals that could add conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| and suggest proposals that could make that access better, provide for better access management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:54| But as it is with the proposal, the zoning of the property to CR is inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7554)|
| 2:06:01| and that was supported by the planning commission by a 13-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| Now, back to the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| This is another situation on your agenda where you really can't take action on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| Well, you can take action on the appeal if you choose to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| That would be based on the denial by MPC of the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| If you're inclined to favor or allow consideration of a commercial plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| then you can initiate that tonight, a request for a planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| or a rural commercial designation for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| That would have to go back to MPC for their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| They could make a report either for or against that request, and then that would come back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| So based on the state statute that was approved a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| you really can't act on the rezoning tonight other than to deny the rezoning or deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7616)|
| 2:07:04| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I may have been a little unclear in my appeal documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| I am not appealing the zoning at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| I had to bring the whole thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| But what I am requesting the county commission to do is just what Mr. Johnson said at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:24| to refer this matter back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for consideration of rural commercial zoning at this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:33| I would respectfully disagree with Mr. Johnson's statement that this is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| By very definition of commercial, rural commercial and neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| it is spot zoning because it is in a commercial designation for an area that is in a rural area or a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7665)|
| 2:07:56| where there is no other commercial around, and it allows for very limited commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| What we're asking you all to do is to remand this or send it back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:11| ask them to reinitiate a study or for you all to initiate a study of rural commercial for this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7691)|
| 2:08:22| in consideration of the application of Mr. Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| In that process, just like you all did at Choteau Road and North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7706)|
| 2:08:32| we can put conditions on that use that would obviate every objection the neighborhood has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7712)|
| 2:08:40| There are a number of people here who are in support of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| It's hard to get people out on a rainy night to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| It's easy to get them to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| But I think the people who are here in support should stand up and be recognized or raise their hands, however you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:57| As you can see, there are a number of people here in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| With that, I'm trying to talk real fast because I'm aware of the time limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| I would like to turn it over to Mr. Chad Kennedy, not Todd Kennedy, and let him talk about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| And I would like to thank the commissioners who came out and looked at the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| I think a personal viewing of this property helped you all understand the project very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:31| My name is Chad Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| I live at 4185 Tawanda Trail, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| I'm asking you to recommend that MPC change the sector plan to commercial rule for the 1104 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| I'd like to thank all the commissioners for taking my phone calls and meeting me on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| I do know I have opposition to my project, and that's why I've held two public meetings on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| And I've also attended two West Knox County Council of Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| From day one, I have listened and tried to address their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| And still today, I'm willing to sit down, work with my opposition, and make this project a win-win for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| I realize with change comes uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| And some people have a hard time envisioning new ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| However, in today's market, one thing is certain, and that is change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| Change is necessary, and it creates new opportunities within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| I'd like to briefly address their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| First, restaurant noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| The restaurant will be an estimated two and a half to three football fields away from the nearest opposition's home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| and approximately two miles away from the Tan Rare subdivision's entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| I will be planting a thick line of shrubbery along Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| The shrubs will help hide the train track and block any noise from the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| Fox Road Marina is my neighbor and, in my opinion, creates much more noise than the restaurant would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| The Norfolk Railroad train travels by my site 15 to 20 times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| According to the decibel test, I registered 102 and 109 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| This is equivalent to you sitting at the 12th row of a rock concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| Second, Fox Road traffic and road safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| There are three ways to and from my site, Kent Hollow to Fox Road, Fox Road, and Emory Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| My customers will be using Fox Road when it is the least traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| It will be used from 11 to 2 p.m. for lunch and 6 to 10 p.m. for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| We will miss all school traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| I am planning to work with Knox County planners to build a turning lane in front of my property on Fox Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| and help create a safe entrance and exit from the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| We are also working with TDOT and Norfolk Southern Railroad to help pay for the installation of crossing arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| at the Kent Hollow Railroad crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| In my opinion, the biggest safety problem with Fox Road is that drivers drive over the speed limit while on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| The width of the road would be just fine if drivers drove the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| This speeding problem could be solved very simply, quickly, and affordably with more speed limit signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| small speed bump strips, and better driver awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| If we can slow drivers down on Fox Road, there would be no need to widen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| Third, my restaurant concept, and I want to be 110 percent clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| I am not opening a biker bar, sports bar, honky-tonk, or nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| I am planning to open a family, boater, and neighborhood-friendly restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| My hours will be 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| We will specialize in wood-fired chicken, steaks, burgers, pizzas, and barbecue ribs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| Our pricing will be very comparable to Aubrey's, which is a local favorite restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| This is not, I repeat, this is not a late-night drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| I take the serving of alcohol very seriously, and we will do our best to not allow our patrons to be over-served alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| At every one of my public meetings, I have used nearly the same description for my concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| Unfortunately, the leaders of the opposition have continued to misinform the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| and you, the commissioners, about my restaurant concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Their scare tactic has been to tell everybody I'm opening a bar, playing loud music outdoors until 2 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| and for that, I feel they have lost much of their credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| My Gatlinburg restaurants are designed for that market, and this restaurant will be designed for the Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| Now I'd like to discuss the positive effects this restaurant will have on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| and why the majority of our residents want this restaurant to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| I'll be creating over 100 construction jobs during the construction phase of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| I'll also employ approximately 70 restaurant jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| There will also be a positive ripple effect on jobs across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| The estimated cost of this project is $2.5 to $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| and a conservative gross sales estimate for the restaurant is $2 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| I'll be introducing over $500,000 in annual payroll to Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| According to the Knox County Property Tax Assessor's Office to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| this property will raise the property tax from approximately $2,000 annually right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| to over $28,000 annually when the project is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| This is a $26,000 annual increase in Knox County's tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| According to the market data analysis conducted by MKD Appraisal and Consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| the restaurant would actually increase the surrounding property owner's value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| and improve their property's marketability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| I do also use Chattanooga as a good example of a city that has done a great job in developing its waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:07| They have taken full advantage of their waterfront's beauty and they have grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| they have greatly grown their economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| I believe Knoxville needs to learn from Chattanooga's successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| Mr. Kennedy, you have a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| For my property, I envision creating a public park setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| I have plans to build a walkway around the shoreline with benches and lampposts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| I want to build a public fishing pier, a small bait shop in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| I'd also like to build a play area for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| I envision this restaurant as a place our community, visitors, and tourists can come enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| and take full advantage of the beautiful lake and scenery we have been blessed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| I'm a local businessman and the profits from this restaurant would stay locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| Joe and Betty McHenry are the current owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| They have had this property for sale since 2006 with absolutely no contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| This property has KB utility easements, TVA flowage easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| and setbacks that almost eliminate the ability to build a home on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| History shows that this property will not be sold for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| Additionally, Fox Road Marina shares a property line with my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| and nobody wants to live right next to the marina or its four-story metal building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| and the loud noises it creates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Joe and Betty were business owners in our community for over 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| Due to health reasons, they are now both living in an assisted living home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| They view this property as their 401K plan and they need to sell it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:20| I am a big believer in property rights and I feel it is time for them to sell their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| I'm finishing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| I have over 15 years of experience in the restaurant industry and I'm very confident in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| I say let's move Knox County forward and give our citizens the jobs they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| Let's see where you all finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| I'd like to say a lot more, but we're constrained to five minutes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| Well, I gave you a little leeway of a little more than five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| and I want to make sure that the opposition knows they'll have the same amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| Mr. Chairman, just if I could clarify, an appeal is properly before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| That was what was submitted, was an appeal of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| And that was how it was advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| So just to get that clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| So in our opinion, you could still act upon the appeal if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| Mr. Seymour is right, you know, in making his request for consideration of the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:13| but you still have the opportunity to act upon the appeal if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| And I'm simply asking that all of that be referred back to MPC and that MPC consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:26| or that you all can ask MPC to change the sector plan to rural commercial for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:36| Opposition, are there those here who are in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| My name is John Carniff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| I live at 10212 El Pinar Drive in the Tanrara-Oreste subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| which is directly across from the property that is being discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| Joining me also tonight, Mr. John Schoonmaker, who is also from Tanrara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| Steve Haygood, who is on the Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| and I'd like to have the folks from behind me who are in that community that surrounds this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| These folks are enthusiastically here to support the MPC decision to deny that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| I'll just make three points from the many that we've collected in opposition to what's been presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| First of all, the MPC has already given unanimous rejection of the request to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| from the current agricultural zoning and described the rezoning proposal as, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| not meeting any of the general plan criteria regarding changes of conditions warranting amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| The Southwest Sector Plan designation calls for low-density residential land use in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| and the land use descriptions in that October 2005 plan should be allowed to provide our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| with a continuity of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| We encourage you to follow the MPC recommendation not to rezone the area along Fox Road to rural commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| and thereby maintain the integrity of that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| The second point, Fox Road between Canton Hollow and Emory Church Road is not suitable for additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| necessary to support the rezoning to a commercial use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| Listen to those who live on this road and consider the MPC staff comments, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| CR rezoning would have a negative impact on both the street system as well as the residential neighbors in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:33| While you may be familiar with other challenging roads in our county, we ask that your decision be based on this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:41| and the danger that increased traffic presents to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| Clearly, the hazards of this narrow road, especially in the area that's being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| as well as low shoulders presents an increased risk to homeowners, vehicle operators, and bicyclists who use that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:59| And while the suggestion of road changes into that property might mitigate the hazard for entry and exit into a commercial venture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:08| most of Fox Road between Canton Hollow and Emory Church would still suffer the increased risk from the additional traffic proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8348)|
| 2:19:16| We urge that your decision give substantial weight to the increased risk this zoning will present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| and that you take a stand for us as your residents for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| In fairness to the community that surrounds this area of Fox Road, we encourage you reject the intrusion this rezoning would bring to a mostly residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:39| Many of us chose to raise our families in this area because of the rural characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| and to now have that establishment that would be allowed under CR zoning seems wholly unfair to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8384)|
| 2:19:51| We are certainly aware there are folks who support this appeal, but I assure you, for those of us who live nearest to Ground Zero, we're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8391)|
| 2:20:01| I'd ask you to consider that this be a proposal that was given to you for your backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| and how would you feel if a restaurant, a bar, a cell tower, or any other establishment be put next to your backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8407)|
| 2:20:16| I don't think you'd like it, neither do we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| Ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the antagonistic comments that some people have made in us as opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:26| we are not against what Mr. Kennedy has in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| What we are against, however, is to maintain the consistency of residential planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| and to ask you to hold safety in high regards as you go about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| Thank you, sir, for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| We have some minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Is someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Mr. Haygood, would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| Yes, I'm Steve Haygood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| I live at 914 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| I've lived there for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| My wife Andrea is here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| This is not just a restaurant vote or an issue, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| The issue is to allow some 50-something permitted uses that this particular zoning would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:10| the various business operations that would be permitted there on the McHenry home place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| The commercial zoning would allow a wide variety of business types, not just what's talked about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| One was mentioned, farm equipment, mulch operations, machinery equipment rentals, veterinary clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:28| animal hospitals, commercial cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| If this property is rezoned to this particular zoning, it's not what just this property might be used for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| but for future generations, future people that live in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:44| The infrastructure just simply doesn't permit any additional traffic down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8504)|
| 2:21:51| The density of the subdivisions and the neighborhoods generate enough traffic to keep it busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| A lot of people cut through Fox Road now with Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| If you go up Fox Road, up Canton Holla to the traffic lights, you go right straight into the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| and traffic light at Level Road, which takes you to the entrance of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| On the Fox Road boat dock issue, keep in mind that that's grandfathered nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| Fox Road boat dock has been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| Fox Road boat dock generates activity, but it only generates activity about six months out of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| and during the spring and the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| And most of that activity really is on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| It does create traffic, the wide boat trailers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| The road is only 18 feet wide, Fox Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| The boat dock doesn't generate traffic that's that heavy, but the traffic it generates is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:51| One of the issues that we'd have to deal with is if this property is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| it's not just the permitted business uses that are there that brings the customers to those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| but it's the vendors and the suppliers that would bring in trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| and various supplier and delivery equipment that would bring the raw materials there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| for whatever is being done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| The infrastructure is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| It doesn't appear to be that there's an ability to widen any of those roads coming in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:22| given the density of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| I think for all the citizens of Knox County, there's no shortage of restaurants in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| There's even a waterfront restaurant on Knox County property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| almost directly across the lake down there, the Lakeside Restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| which serves people from the water also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| So I'd ask you that you vote no to the commercial rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| and the amendment to the sector plan of the McHenry Homesite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| I want to be fair to everybody, so I'm going to ask Mr. Schoonmaker to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| then we'll have Mr. Seymour an opportunity to respond as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| John Schoonmaker, 144 Tanrera Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| First, I'd like to submit a petition, 143 signatures with name, address, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:11| Would you present this to the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Of some of the folks that couldn't be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| to the lady right next to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| Three things I'd like to bring to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| One, the definition of rural commercial that this book is the guiding force behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:37| It is Section 5.3.01, General Description of Rural Commercial Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:44| This commercial zoning district provides the opportunity to locate limited retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:50| and service uses in a manner convenient to outlying rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| Fox Road is not an outlying rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| We're two and a half miles from the entrance to the Turkey Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| On the way to Turkey Creek, we have an auto parts store, we have a appliance store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| we have a sonic restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| We even have a Walgreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| We're not out in the middle of nowhere where we need additional rural facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| So the zoning classification that they're asking for doesn't even exist for this type of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8723)|
| 2:25:30| They're stretching it to even work for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| The second thing, the Southwest Sector Plan says that rural commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| is basically south of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| Well, folks, this is north of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| This is not even in the rural commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8749)|
| 2:25:55| Second thing, ten years ago, properties on Fox Road, residential homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8755)|
| 2:26:04| were being converted over to offices and commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| This body, the Knox County Commission, asked the MPC to get the community together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| and decide how Fox Road was going to play out with commercial and business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| So they did the Fox Road corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| The MPC conducted two meetings with the community present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| and the community reluctantly decided that from Kingston Pike coming down Fox Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| that they would give up those residential homes for business commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| But it was supposed to stop where the Pellissippi Parkway intersected with the Fox Road street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8805)|
| 2:26:53| In other words, right in front of the new Castlewood subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| So they told the community that no commercial would go past that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| And you folks, not you in particular, but the Knox County Commission adopted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| on November 19th of 2001, and that was the Fox Road corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| So you have a sector plan that says that's not rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| so the zoning designation doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| You've got the Fox Road corridor study that you told the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| that's where everything was going to stop, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| It wasn't going to keep going down Fox Road into the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| And then the third thing, I think the MPC staff did a great job of their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8855)|
| 2:27:44| to research this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| The MPC commissioners did the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| They 13-0 vote unanimously to deny the sector plan and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8870)|
| 2:28:00| The community showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| They did their due diligence in contacting everybody involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| to make sure they had their issues heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| Now it looks like, well, let me back up one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| When we first were scheduled at the MPC at the 11th hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| the applicant delayed it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| Now we're here and the community's here for a vote from you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| and now they want to play games and kick it back to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| We just don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| If you want to build trust and integrity with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8910)|
| 2:28:35| there's got to be some continuity and some consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:39| And I would ask you tonight to go ahead and deny the appeal of CGK, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| for 1104 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, let me clear the air on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| Regardless of the zoning there, a cell tower can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| We're not proposing that, but a cell tower can go in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| You can put hog farming in there, chicken farming, rabbit farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| There has been chicken raising there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| These are all your issues or uses that are permitted there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| Sawmill is one that's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| I was encouraged when I heard Mr. Carnes say that they liked Mr. Kennedy's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| I think everybody that has gone and looked at it likes the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8967)|
| 2:29:33| To our knowledge, no MPC commissioner went to the property and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| I think a number of the county commissioners have gone and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| And the proposal makes sense when you look at the road, the Fox Road marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:53| And what we're asking is that this go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| We can agree with Mr. Haygood that 90% of the uses in the rural commercial zone not be permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=8999)|
| 2:30:07| and we can do that by a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| And we're more than willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| We would like to sit down and say, what is it you all don't want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| You know what Mr. Kennedy's proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| It is a lake-oriented restaurant, and that's all he wants to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| And we're willing to take away uses that people in the neighborhood find objectionable, and we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:34| That's all we're asking for the opportunity to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| At the Fox Road marina, if you look down there, they have a repair facility now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| They do, I think, small engine repair and boat repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| They can put a restaurant and a bar in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| They have dry storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| There's a big building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| That was approved as a use on review, that dry storage building, by the Metropolitan Planning Commission a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9053)|
| 2:31:02| So what we are asking here tonight is that we go back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:10| We meet with Mr. Schoonmaker, Mr. Carniff, Mr. Haygood, and anybody else they want to meet with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:19| We've been begging for that from the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| Sit down, tell us what you don't like in the CR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| We'll agree and agree to a condition that that can't be done on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| We will talk to you and agree on hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| We will talk to you and agree on outside music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| We will talk to you and agree on proper landscaping for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| We will meet with Knox County Engineering and agree and pay for what needs to be done to the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:55| That's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| We think this is a reasonable request, something that will enhance the waterfront here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9117)|
| 2:32:05| and make it much more attractive to boaters on the lake and to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:13| And we would ask that you send all of this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| and request that they consider a rural commercial sector plan for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:27| and consider rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| We have at least four commissioners with lights on, but first I'd like to go to Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| Can we get a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| And all the folks that came from the Fox Road area and the Tanneraw Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9159)|
| 2:32:44| thank you very much for coming down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| I know a lot of times when issues like this come up, you wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| is your representative going to support the voice of the people that live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| And I want you to know that I've talked to a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| I've sent e-mails back and forth to a lot of you, and I have heard what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a recommendation to deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9182)|
| 2:33:07| and maintain what MPC's recommendations were initially, and that's to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9187)|
| 2:33:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| We have lights on, and forgive me if I don't go in proper order, but let's go to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9207)|
| 2:33:28| I've got several questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| We've had several people talk, and I've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| You can stand where you are and answer these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| You don't necessarily have to come back up to the microphone unless you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Mr. Kennedy, in your comments earlier, you mentioned something about marine rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9221)|
| 2:33:52| What I understood was this was to be a small dock where the boats could pull in and eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| have a place to park while they eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| Are we going to have skidoos rented out of your place, marine rentals out of your place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| Marine rentals we have applied for, but there will be no jet skis, there will be no big boats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| there will be no cruise ships, there won't be dining on a boat and taking it on charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| What we're looking at is small paddle boats, kayaks, things of that nature that families can enjoy with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| Well, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| That is another restriction that we would agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| Your big bugaboo and hurdle to cross is dealing with TVA and getting permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| because everything you're going to do there, if you're on the water, it's going to put a port-a-potty there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9273)|
| 2:34:38| it's going to have to be approved by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| And part of the packet that I gave you that already had an e-mail that was sent back from Martin High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| the program director at TVA, I've already gone through their preliminary approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| They've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| They've come back to me and said, Chad, there's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| There's nothing that we're going to shoot you down right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| You're okay to go ahead and turn in an application to fill in bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| So I've already been working with them for probably six to eight weeks already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| and they're waiting on the decision from Knox County to know if I can go forward with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9301)|
| 2:35:06| Then they will allow me to turn in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| So, to be quite frank, I was thinking the same way you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| TVA is going to be the hard part, but I think this might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| One other question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| It's been mentioned by a couple of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| I'm not sure whether it was you or the opposition author, but an outside patio and karaoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9319)|
| 2:35:25| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| No outdoor music, no karaoke music, and I've made that clear on every meeting I've had with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| There would be an outside patio for dining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| We are planning on taking advantage of the beautiful lake there and having people dine outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| But no outdoor music, no karaoke, outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| One more question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| This piece of property, is it part of the piece west of it, the McHenry piece west of it, still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9344)|
| 2:35:53| Or you're buying a piece of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| I am buying three and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| Of that piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| Of that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| The whole, this is getting technical here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| You've got five acres to the west, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| You've got five and a half to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9366)|
| 2:36:07| You have an acre in the middle, and then you have three and a half that I am purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| If that clears that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| You have three and a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| It's going to stay with Betsy McHenry, who's going to be a resident there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| She's not moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| She's in full support of this restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| She plans on staying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| Then you have the five acres to the far west that has just recently went on the market for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9379)|
| 2:36:27| I'm just buying the three and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| And part of our negotiations, we gave her approximately one half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| That's how we got to the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| If I could just supplement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| A subdivision map has been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| It's awaiting signatures where this three and a half acres would be subdivided off from the big trunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| That's all I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| MPC, when was the southwest sector plan last updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9407)|
| 2:36:56| I think during 2005 and 2006 was the process with the actual approvals in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9416)|
| 2:37:05| We've got a bunch of them we've got to update then, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| Well, that's one of the newer ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| The reason I'm asking that question, you know, when we come up with a proposal here that would necessitate a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9433)|
| 2:37:23| it's a whole lot easier to justify it whenever it's been a long time since the plan has been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:31| The gentleman, I think it was Mr. Haywood, commented on the 50-some uses that could be used on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9451)|
| 2:37:42| Everybody, only if you're nuts, the way I looked at that property out there, that property is good for a couple of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9462)|
| 2:37:51| And a mulching operation or some of these other things, I mean, a cell tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| you couldn't even get approval for that on that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| This piece of property is limited to 50 uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9481)|
| 2:38:06| It's limited to two uses out of the 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| So I'm going to make a motion that we honor Mr. Seymour's request to send this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| so that you all can get together and set a time to renegotiate some of these questionable things you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| This would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:25| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9505)|
| 2:38:26| So we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| Are you through, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:33| Did you want to say something, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| Yes, I'd like to, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| In order to send this back, we need some very specific language to satisfy state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| and that would be to initiate for the Planning Commission's consideration a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:52| to rural commercial land use classification for the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| So if the motion includes that type of language, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| Does the maker of the motion wish to include that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| That approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| Anything else, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9548)|
| 2:39:09| That will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| You know, I almost did not go down and look at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| I knew where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9555)|
| 2:39:16| At least I thought of where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| Everything I got for weeks and weeks, it was all negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Everything was negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| And so I went down there and looked at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:31| I've got questions for several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| Just real quick, Chad, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| How many MPC commissioners came?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| I know Arthur mentioned, he didn't think, did any MPC commissioners meet with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| How many county commissioners met with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| Nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| Nine out of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| And I want to comment to commissioners, I'm proud of our commission group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| everybody going down and taking an active role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| We marked that 10 because I came on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Oh, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| Yeah, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| I think Sam might have come too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| I just may not have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| Oh, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| I know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| So continue, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| But once I got there, and you showed me just real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| it was not anything that I had envisioned whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| and I agree with what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| You talk about TVA and getting approved on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| and we talked about that a little bit on Friday when I was down there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| And, you know, I'm on the board for Parks and Greenway for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| and we have gone through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| And I think you'll be able to get that because, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| you're not putting a cell tower in anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| Chad, in your opinion, why do you think NPC turned you down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| I think they turned me down because they were uneducated on the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Once you all got out there and looked at all the obstacles this property has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| all the restrictions, all the easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| you all were able to make a better decision, a more educated decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| NPC just did not dedicate any time and do any due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| Buzz, make sure I'm correct, and Mark, if I'm correct on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| Let's say he has 10,000 people a day coming to his place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| He's only responsible for the road frontage in front of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| and if it causes more roads, whatever, on these other roads we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| then Knox County would be the ones that would pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| and have to decide where that would be on their priority list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| whether they wanted to widen those roads or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| Would it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| It might not be quite so cut and dried as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| Sometimes development is required to make improvements to intersections that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9701)|
| 2:41:47| But he's going to have an egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| Chad, are you going to have an egress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| That's what we're going to be working with if this goes through with county planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| to build and install a center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| So you're going to be in charge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| In front of my property, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9720)|
| 2:42:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| Sir, you're saying that you'd like to meet with the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| and you guys get together and you all will sign off on what you will not permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9727)|
| 2:42:14| the hog farms and all this stuff that's just crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| You'll sign off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| We'd love to have that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| I think we can eliminate, as Commissioner Brown said, 99% of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| We can agree even further on hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| methods of operation, buffering, landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| We can meet with Knox County Engineering and work on road, off-site road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9756)|
| 2:42:43| And I think if we could just get everybody at the table, this is one that we could work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9763)|
| 2:42:51| I'm going to say this to the community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| When I went down there and I talked to Chad, first time I ever met Chad and his wife down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| I was thoroughly impressed, Chad, with what you just read out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| I guess it's because so many other commissioners have already been there too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| but you listed things, your hours of operation, how it would conflict with the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| how it wouldn't conflict with the school's schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| You have really thought this out for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| How long has this been on, this piece of property, been sitting there, been sitting vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| that it's been on the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| Since 2006 and, again, with zero contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| Nobody is willing to buy that piece of property for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| Well, my bottom line with it is, you know, to begin with, I was not for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| because I heard it was going to be a honky-tonk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| That's what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| Well, okay, what's it going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| But when I got there, looked at the site, looked at your plan, looked at the vision that you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| and my opinion, we'll drive from Halls, we'll drive to Halls to go to Lakeside Tavern quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| It's one of our favorite places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| And if you're going to build on something like that, you know, I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| I think it's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| I think it's good for the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| And I applaud you for your vision of what you're wanting to do there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| and the step that you're wanting to take with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| So I wish you the best of luck, and I want to support this going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9850)|
| 2:44:14| And, Arthur, I strongly encourage MPC commissioners to come and look at the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:19| and take a look and meet the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| Meet the developer on the site and see what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| But I wish you good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| Mr. Schoonmaker, I'm going to give you an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| Yes, Commissioner Smith, I don't want you to leave the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| that the metropolitan planning commissioners did not go view the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| They did not go on a tour with Mr. Kennedy, but they did review the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:46| I'm willing to guess that probably ten of the thirteen commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| that voted to deny this were on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9890)|
| 2:44:54| We have a resident who lives directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| who witnessed several of the commissioners on the property walking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| I had several phone calls with MPC commissioners where they'd said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| John, I was out there yesterday, I walked the property, I saw where the stakes were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| So please don't imply that the MPC commissioners, this vote was not important to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| because it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| They had the same amount of correspondence sent to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| that you guys have had in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| So it was important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| And the other thing is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| Let me address that right there before you get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| If I sent you out to Halls to look at my property out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| and I don't bother to show up and can't explain to you what you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| and what my vision is, what I'm going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| you're going to look, okay, here it is, all right, I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| This man took the time with the people and explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| He's there to defend what he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| How can the MPC commissioners make, without talking to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| get all the facts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| They're going to get one-sided facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| They also drove down Canton Hollow Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| and realized the access to the site makes no sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| when you're driving that windy, curvy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| So they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| They did come down Canton Hollow Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| and then exit the property going up Fox Road to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| I did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| But they also questioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| how are you going to get beer delivery trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| that are lowriders over where the railroad crossings are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| School buses have a hard time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| The other thing is, Mr. Kennedy is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| There have been no contracts on that site since 2006, I believe, as he stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9986)|
| 2:46:32| But there have been inquiries to purchase that property for residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:39| but the intermediaries have priced it at commercial rates instead of residential rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| So immediately the people back off and don't enter into a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| So if you're a commercial business and you want to sign a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| sure, that's going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| But if you hear of something that's priced at commercial values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| instead of residential values, it makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| John went down there and looked at the flags and stuff that he had on his loft there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:09| I don't guess he's bought the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| But without the developer there to show me what I was looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| they're different colored flags and they're all different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| You need somebody there to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| And I've got a background in surveying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| But without somebody to sit there and tell you this is what this level is and that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| if I was an MPC commissioner, I'd just sort of show up and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| And I really wouldn't know what I'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| Well, I think a lot of them, when they looked at the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| realized what the 820 line is or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| I'm not a surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| But they did go down and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10066)|
