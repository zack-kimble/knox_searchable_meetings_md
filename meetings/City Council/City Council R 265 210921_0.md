| 0:12:47| in the Knoxville Fire Department for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| and it's where we educate children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| on basically fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=771)|

| 0:14:35| I just wondered for the public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| if we could get a little information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| about how many bus stops this might impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| I'm gonna ask Director of CAT, Isaac Thorn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| to come up to the podium and answer that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Good evening, Isaac Thorn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Director of Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| To answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| we're looking at about 200 bus stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| to be able to improve with this $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Could be more, could be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Really depends on when we get into looking at each stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| We have to do a site plan for each stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| and turn that into the city for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Every stop is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| We may have to, each stop, we may have to include sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| We may have to do some more grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| So each stop is gonna be different in cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| but I'm averaging about $6,000 per site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Okay, and how many sites are there total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Do you know how many stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| So right now we're starting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| with a prioritized list of about 100 to 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| That's internally we're starting off that with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| We wanna go to the public and ask them about each stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| And we're basing that priority list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| off of just ridership right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| but we also wanna look at making sure all these stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| we're doing this equitably throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| but also looking at each individual rider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and maybe the mobility issues they have at these stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| So that's also gonna be factored into our prioritized list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Okay, so of 150 stops that are prioritized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| but how many total stops are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Do you know, I have a ballpark number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| So in our bus system, we have about 1,100 bus stops total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you, Mr. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| This is a grant application for $900,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| with a $300,000 match from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| My question to director Juneau is whether this 300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| has been budgeted in this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| or would it require a budget amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Mr. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Councilman Roberto, it has not been budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| We will be bringing you a budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| at a forthcoming date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| We typically do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| we have some money set aside in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| for grant matches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| but we do not have that type of amount set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Okay, so just procedurally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| if we were to get the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| then there'll be a budget amendment that will come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1023)|
| 0:17:03| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| I wanted to make a similar point as councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| but also just want to thank director Thorne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| for the initiative he's taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| in finding new funding sources to address issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| that have long needed addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| We've had many requests from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| to improve our best stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| and increase the amenities at those stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| So I appreciate director Thorne for bringing this before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| and I appreciate the administration support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1066)|

| 0:19:42| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| It's pretty monotonous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| out of the fees that we charge and the sponsorships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| I didn't know if we had an approximate amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| of how that offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Ms. Brewer, who's here from Special Events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Kendra, could you answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Council Member Testerman's question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Yes, could you ask that again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I wanted to know approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| the fees that are charged for the skate rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| et cetera, and the sponsorships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| how much we're getting from that approximately each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| We charge $12 for an adult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| and I wanna say, sorry, about 10, I think, for a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| We also go out and secure sponsorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Home Federal Bank is our premier sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| and presenting sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| And then we'll have media sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| such as B97.5 and WBIR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| And so we go out and collect money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Pilot is a sponsor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| So that offsets some of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| I didn't know approximately how much it might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| the rentals and all of that, how much it might offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| We try to keep the rentals low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| so everybody can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1255)|
| 0:20:55| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you, Ms. Testerman and Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I understand what Councilwoman Testerman was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| It's sort of like net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| what does it cost the city after sponsorships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| 50,000 of the 81,000 or 30 something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| I'm just kind of, I think that's kind of what you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| We can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| If Ms. Brewer doesn't have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| we can get it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1277)|
| 0:21:17| I don't have those exact numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| that I brought with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| It changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| A lot of that depends on weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Like I know in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| we had about 16,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| attend on a course of a 45 day opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| but it's also very weather dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| We don't longer have a tent over the rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| So if it's raining, we have to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| So it really depends at the end of the season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| once we're able to balance out the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| All I'm trying to get at is the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Do we hope to cover 50% of the cost with revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Do we hope to cover 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| I'm not really trying to put anybody on the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I'm just saying we do special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| in our organization too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| We get sponsorships, we charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| but we also kind of understand maybe we cover 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Honestly, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| But what I'll do is for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| we'll get together and balance that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| and just send it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| I'm gonna vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I just, it's just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| I'm not saying I'm not gonna vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I just think that's a question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| if we raise money sponsorships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| kind of what's our net?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| We try to cover our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| That's basically what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| I don't have an exact figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| but we do try to cover the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| So we try to cover 81,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| We try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| We'll get back to you with the particulars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| but I think the main message is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1354)|

| 0:22:46| do we cover any of the $80,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1366)|

| 0:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1401)|
| 0:23:21| My name is Chris O'Keefe, 1000 Buchanan Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| right off of Broadway and 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| I'm the business manager for the iron workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| here in Knoxville in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I come today representing labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| not only mine, but all labor here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Before being business manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| I was elected in that position in June of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| much like yourselves, I was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I was organizer for the local for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Oak Ridge is a huge job we have in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| I don't know if you all are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| they're building a new uranium processing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| In my opinion, it's the biggest project in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| It's where all uranium is processed, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| It's in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| The labor of this East Tennessee has manned that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| They've manned it, they've been ahead of schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| they're still on schedule, the project's halfway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| I don't know if you all know anybody in Oak Ridge or CNS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| that's out there, give them a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Ask them how labor's doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| In my three years as organizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| I've driven around the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I've seen projects that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I'm not born from here, I was moved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| relocated at 15 to Morristown, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| I come from South Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| It was a culture shock, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| But I bleed orange now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| I bleed orange like everyone else here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| I've never seen it in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| You come to a Tennessee game, you experience it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| But one thing that really annoyed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| is the engineer building they just put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| It was a huge project, a huge project for UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And I go out there and I see the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| the contractor's not local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| The GC, the general contractor might be local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| but the subcontractor and anything isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| The guy's building the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| I go out to the parking lot where they're all parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I'm trying to organize, we have a big project right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| I'm trying to get people to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and help us with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| And all of them are from other states, they're not from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| And that's great, I'm glad they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| a working opportunity here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| but they're going home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| We're talking about a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| We're talking about giving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| to a contractor to build a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| And I'm all for it, I'm for labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Labor keeps my men, my men, my women here at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| When they're not here at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| they're out building other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| They've got to work, they've got to continue working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| And I don't know if you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| there's a shortage of labor right now, across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| I mean, I've got TVA major contractors, CNS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| I mean, huge contractors calling me and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| can you man these projects for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Because we don't have the skilled labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So the guys are skilled and safe to do these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| What I'm asking is, if we're going to give this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| to a contractor to develop something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| that's here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| I think we should have something that's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| you should build it locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| You should build it with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| that are going to bring the families here, the kids here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| They're going to say, hey, look, dad built this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Look, mom welded this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| This is actually mom's weld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| I'm speaking as an iron worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| but carpenters and painters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| man, it's going to all the way across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| But right now, it's people building, don't even live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Don't have any attachments, don't bleed orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| And I say that, I mean, you see it on the commercials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| it's all about the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| You hear about, we're all about our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| but we don't care who builds what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| It's just construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| You drive by the site, you just see construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| But we need to do it with people who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| That's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1598)|
| 0:26:38| And I think you all believe the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| But now is the call to action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| to actually make it implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| I've seen our sister city do it in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| They were able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| And I saw a soccer stadium that was a huge soccer stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| It's not the stadium, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It's the development that's coming around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| that stadium as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| You want to redo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| We're trying to build up the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Well, let's do it, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Let's put it on writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Let's put our mouths where our words are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| where the money's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Let's get something out of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| And the sports authority is a great opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| That's something where we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| hey, the money needs to allocate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| do this here, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| But where's the labor coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| And on the end of that, who's going to do retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Are all the retail workers going to be a minimum wage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Is that building your community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| I mean, that's, so I ask, I don't want to waste your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| but obviously you can see I'm passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210921?start=1645)|
