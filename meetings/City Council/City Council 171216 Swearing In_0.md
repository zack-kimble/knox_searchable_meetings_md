| 0:02:45| and officially start their careers as elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| Before the new Council members are sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| I'd like to recognize our other current and former elected officials who are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| and I hope with this large crowd that I get everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| If not, just raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| First of all, I'd like to recognize the Council members who are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=183)|

| 0:04:43| Now, as I mentioned, because we have such a large crowd, did I leave anyone out on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| Randy. I'm sorry. Randy Tyree, our former Mayor, let's give him a special round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=289)|
| 0:05:02| You know, I was thinking this morning, of course it was eight years ago that I was sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| but I was thinking this morning that a lot of us who are in public office and who are representing you, the constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for our spouses and our significant others and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| So I want to give them a round of applause also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| In a moment, please stand for the invocation from the Rev. Dr. William Pender, Pastor of First Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| And then, please remain standing for the presentation of the colors by the Knoxville Police Department Honor Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| and the Pledge of Allegiance led by the Honorable Nick Pavlis, our first District Councilman and former Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| Following the pledge, the Gresham Middle School Girls Ensemble will sing the National Anthem led by Michelle Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| So please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| I will pray this day in my tradition of a Christian, as a Presbyterian pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| and according to the New Testament mandate in 1 Timothy 2 that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made by everyone for kings and all in high positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=374)|
| 0:06:23| Duane, you're a king to me, so I want to say I'm glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| In high positions, but I'm delighted to offer this prayer in faithfulness to the New Testament mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| O Lord, our only true authority, bless the leaders of our land that we may be people at peace among ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=399)|
| 0:06:50| that we may be a people bound by justice for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| that we may be a people that serves as a blessing to other communities, even communities beyond our national borders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| We pray that you will keep this nation under your care, and particularly this city, in your closest oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| To mayors, to councilwomen and men, and to all in administrative power, grant wisdom and grace in the exercise of their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| Give courage, wisdom, and foresight to provide for the needs of our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| to fulfill our calling to be a strong and welcoming, indeed prosperous community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| And finally, relying on your strength, may our leaders accept their responsibilities to their fellow citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| that they may serve as trustworthy leaders, make wise decisions for the well-being of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| In the name of our Lord, to whom all power, glory, and kingdom, we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=465)|
| 0:08:08| Honor Guard, march on colors!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| Ready, set, march!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=495)|
| 0:08:46| Please salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=534)|
| 0:09:07| O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=587)|
| 0:09:55| O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=595)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=611)|
| 0:10:42| As the choir is taking their seat, let's give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| I also want to thank the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra String Quartet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| for the music that they played prior to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| There's some other thank yous that I personally would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| I want to thank our council staff, Will Johnson and his staff, for helping to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| Judith Foltz and her staff for putting it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| I also miss Gloria Dethridge. I'm sorry, she's in the crowd also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Let's give her a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| And while I'm thanking people also, I want to thank two special people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| that have been involved with City Council for the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| They were our lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| That was Charles Swanson and Rob Frost, who kept us out of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| And let's give them a round of applause, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Today, as everyone knows, it's about celebrating the new council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| We relish the sense of unity and hope that fill the room today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| and we're eager to support the new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| as they, the current council members, and the mayor continue to move our city forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| But I'd be remiss if I didn't take just a few brief moments to thank my City Council peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| and especially the other four of us whose terms are ending for the trail that we helped blaze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| I want to give, again, a special recognition to Nick Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| Nick Dellavope, Brenda Palmer, and Dan Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| We've been a very unified group and, folks, it's been a pleasure to serve with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and I value our friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| One of the hallmarks of this city council, or the current council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| is the temperament and civility that we all have possessed this last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Especially now, at a time when politics and public discourse at the state and the national levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| can be so divisive, so harsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| this council has really set a model example of what government is and what government should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Even when we disagreed with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| this council showed how it's possible to be respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| and to continue to be productively and work towards solutions and be unified together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| Actually, the civility was ingrained in our culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| and we expect it of our members and we demand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| The result has been a robust, transparent, and meaningful public dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| We welcome the inclusion and the interaction of our fellow citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| For the five of us who are rotating off council, it's been a tremendous eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| We've accomplished much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| We've continued the redevelopment of downtown, of the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| We've created new parks, greenways, and outdoors, and upgraded infrastructures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| We've also made a commitment to sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| And, of course, we couldn't have done this without the guidance of our mayor, Madeline Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=824)|
| 0:13:53| We've also, in the last eight years, dealt with some pretty tough decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| and some pretty tough, controversial issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Pension reform, it seems like we always had zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Of course, just lately, the short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| And then, of course, the one that I've probably struggled the most with for three and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| was the new sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| But for myself and the four others, our time on council has come to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| But the incoming new members stand ready to accept the baton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| This is what is exciting about the legacy that we leave and what we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Judging by the way they ran their positive campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| how they were respectful to their political opponents, how they listened to their constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| I'm certain that they will represent their districts well and continue to move our city forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| Our great dialogue, our spirit of respect and inclusion, I'm confident that will continue and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| So, new council, thank you for indulging me, as well as the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| for a few minutes to reflect on the past and the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Now I'd like to introduce Mayor Madeline Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| who will have the pleasure of working with this new council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| as it continues to build Knoxville's great future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Mayor, thank you for the six years that we've had working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and thank you for the wonderful administration that has also worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Mayor Madeline Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=916)|
| 0:15:27| I want to thank you, Vice Mayor Gree, for your excellent leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| You know, today is really a day of celebration, as we welcome these five new members to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| And it wasn't easy for them to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| These candidates had competent opposition, and I see many of those folks in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| which is great that they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| And that competition was strong both in the primary and the general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| But these council members-elect, they ran good campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| and they worked 24-7 to share their message, their experience, and their vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| So, congratulations, council members-elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Today, we're here to celebrate with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| I, too, want to recognize the outgoing council members who have accomplished much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| and who have served with integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| You've worked hard, you've engaged people in public dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| and you've been respectful and civil in the process to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| to me and my administration, and to the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| So, I want to personally thank my councilman and our former vice mayor, Nick Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| our councilman and vice mayor, Duane Greve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| councilwoman Brenda Palmer, councilman Nick Dellivope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| and councilman and former mayor Dan Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| You've been exceptional public servants, and I've been honored to serve with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| So, while today is a happy occasion for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| it may also be a bit overwhelming for these new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| because for an elected official, this is when it becomes real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| You've thought long and hard about what you'd do if you were elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| and you've talked about it throughout the campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And now, suddenly, it's time. It is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| In fact, in just a few minutes at the special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| you will take your first official votes to elect your leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| and then a few days later on Tuesday night, you will begin governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| as you vote on contracts and appointments and ordinances and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| But I've watched each of you, and I am confident that this will be a great council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| So, back in 1990, I was elected to my first public office as a Knox County commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| and I can clearly recall the practical words of advice that were shared by speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| at my swearing-in ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| The one that stands out the most was related to working with the print media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| We were advised to never argue with someone who buys ink by the barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Though the technology continues to change, that advice is still pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| I've learned a lot of other things, often the hard way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| during my four years as an appointed city official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| and my 14 years so far in elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| So I thought I'd share some of my own words of advice with this new council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| that I hope will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Those of you who have served will understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| First and foremost, I learned that good people, reasonable people, often disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| The same two people who knocked on doors with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| and are sitting here side by side to support you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| will have very different opinions on certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Your own family members will disagree with you at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Each of them will be persuasive and well-intentioned and certain that they are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| And all of them may be right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| because often you will have to choose between conflicting right choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| So you won't make everyone happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| In fact, sometimes you will make everyone mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| But that is leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| You do your homework, listen to diverse opinions, weigh the options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| make your very best decision for the overall good of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| and then explain clearly why that decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And then move on and work with those same people and others on the next issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Many may still disagree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| but they'll respect you if you're honest and upfront with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Remember that discussion and debate are part of a healthy democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| And remember that good and reasonable people often disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Second, you will face criticism like you never have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| Learn to embrace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Toughen up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| I've learned to be thick-skinned enough to let most criticism roll off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| but not too thick-skinned that you don't recognize when adjustments need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| To paraphrase Martin Luther King, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| if you worry about every criticism that crosses your desk in the course of a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| you will have little time for anything constructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| All I can say is it's an art, not a science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| but it's a very important skill to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Third, be the leader you were elected to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| This community is looking to you and to all of us to be the leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| to be models of civility and earnest public discourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| to sort through the competing and divergent interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| to decisively chart a course for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| to be compassionate and to give voice to those who are most vulnerable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| to make the big decisions and the tough calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| that will both address the issues of today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| and will determine what Knoxville will be like for our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| our grandchildren, and future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Finally, keep your optimism and your sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| You wouldn't have run for this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| if you weren't optimistic that you could make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| So hold on to that optimism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Optimism is a choice that leads to fearless and effective governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| And a sense of humor is an absolute necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| It's been said that a person without a sense of humor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| is like a wagon without springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| It's jolted by every pebble on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| So a sense of humor will cushion this wonderful ride that you are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| To the families of these new council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| you have a front row seat to the making of history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| for Knoxville over the next four to eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you for supporting your loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| They will need your continued love and support and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| as they embark on this great adventure and this awesome responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| Council members-elect, my entire staff and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| welcome you to council and to public life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| We have much work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| You bring so much to the table, both individually and collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| and I look forward to all the good things that we will accomplish together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Appreciate that and all those good words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| And now we'll begin to do what we all came to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| which is to administer the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| First, please welcome the Honorable Stephanie Welsh, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1350)|

| 0:23:31| required by the Charter and Ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| of the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| or by general law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| for the office that I am about to assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| that I will discharge my duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| as City Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| faithfully, honestly, and impartially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| so help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1435)|

| 0:24:54| I, Andrew James Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171216SwearingIn?start=1494)|
