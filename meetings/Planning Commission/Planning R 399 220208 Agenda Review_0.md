| 0:00:30| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Welcome to the February agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| We do have some technical difficulties on audiovisual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| and they're trying to correct that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| But we'll go ahead, and Amy's got a few items that she wants to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| that won't require the audiovisual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| So I'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| Chairman Phillips, good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| First, I'd like to start off by introducing a new staff member we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| This is Jessie Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| She has joined our staff recently as a senior planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| and her and her family have recently relocated from the Baltimore area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| and we're really thrilled to have her here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| She has a master's degree in city and regional planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| and she will be initially focused on development plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| so you all will see her here at these meetings as well as at the Thursday meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| She'll be working on rezonings and plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| and probably some concepts and use on reviews eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| Welcome, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Just have a few updates on activities that staff have been undertaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Our information services team has been working with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| on an electric vehicle charging station project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| So RGS staff built a computer model to identify locations that were best suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| for electric vehicle charging stations in Knox County as well as the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| The model inputs included population density, employment centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| availability of publicly owned property, proximity to activity centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| opportunity zones for equitable access, air quality, and traffic counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| as well as many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| So looking ahead, as many of you are probably well aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| EV infrastructure is going to be very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| given the rapidly growing electric vehicle adoption rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| and the higher anticipated growth rate in vehicle options from major auto manufacturers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| So at a future meeting, we'd be happy to share that study with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| The North Shore Corridor study has been completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| and we would like to present that out to you at our March agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| The I-40, I-75 interchange study for Watt Road and Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| will be complete as well in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| And some of you might have read that TDOT recently announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| that they will fund two significant roadway projects in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| and that's the I-40 interchange at Watt Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| as well as the I-40 interchange at Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| This represents a significant investment in Knox County of close to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| I think it's $83, $85 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Amy, what's the timeframe on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| That, I don't know exactly what the timeframe is on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| but we'll talk about it at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| The TPO staff have also been working on three transit studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Those are underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| One's a regional study, another is a coordination study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| and operations analysis for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| As these get further along, we will bring staff in to provide you all updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| on those three projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| We have scheduled our first round of community input for the Advanced Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| the Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| These meetings will take place the week of March 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| and more information will be available on these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| as well as other future meetings on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| and I'll be sure to send that out to each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| So I hope that you all will consider attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| as well as sending it out to folks in your network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| Now I can move on to Item 30, which is other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| Last fall, the Executive Committee met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| and recommended amendments to the Commission bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| to shift your annual meeting to the regular June Commission date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| and this change ensures that the election of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| and appointments to the Executive Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| are made in advance of outgoing Commissioner terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| and it should enable officers as well as Executive Committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| to serve full one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Additionally, terms would be limited to two consecutive terms for each officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| and there is a memo in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Hopefully you've had a chance to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| as well as a marked-up version of our bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Does anyone have any questions about these changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| One more other business item we'd like to touch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| This is Item Number 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| and Liz is going to review a map error correction and modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| that's necessary to address what we call an administrative error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| for a property on Knox Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| So this other business item is related to an administrative mapping error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| as Amy mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| The highlighted area you see in blue on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| is in the Whittle Springs area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| It's primarily between Valley View Drive and Sharps Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| It was previously zoned RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| and it is now several different zones under the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| and that includes RN3 and RN6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and those areas are related to what they were actually built out as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| under the previous planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| Most of Sharps Ridge also has the HP overlay zone district on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| And this is a comparison map we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| that shows what the zoning looked like prior to the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| In the map with the blue header, you can see the very light yellow area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| that runs down Valley View Drive along Sharps Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| across from the Whittle Springs Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| This is the old RP1 area that you saw previously highlighted in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| And in the map with the red header,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| you can see the area that has black hatching across it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| and a C designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| which most RP1 areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| when they were brought in to the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| had this hatching on them to indicate the presence of an approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| However, there was not an approved plan for all parts of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| so some of the parcels had previously been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| as special uses and use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Sorry, special uses, which were formerly known as use on reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| and concept plans within that RP1 zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| And we'll see on the next map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| the areas that actually had approved plans for this entire RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| or previously RP1 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| This is a map that our GIS staff helped create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| You can also see this on our online mapping viewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| You can see the areas that have previously approved plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| for special uses and concept plans in dark gray on this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| while the green outline is the entire hatched C-designated area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| that was formerly the RP1 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| So staff discovered this administrative map error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| when a development request application was received to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| that one parcel that you see on this map that says subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| However, this property never had an approved plan associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| so we are recommending to remove that C designation from this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| because there is not an approved plan associated with it in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| Are there questions? I know that's a little convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| Nope. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| And, oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Okay, this is the related rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| So this is the application that was filed that alerted us to the mapping error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| So this is a 0.65-acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| You can see highlighted in blue on here, that's about 28,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| And the applicant is requesting to go to the RN2 zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| They're presently zoned RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| and they are across the street from some RN2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| The RN1 zoning allows single-family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| with minimum lot sizes of 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| while the RN2 zoning allows single-family lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| with minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| And when we look at the sector plan for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| we can see that it's actually part of an MDR area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| designated for medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| which allows consideration of RN3 and RN4 zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| And because of this designation along through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| it was probably shown as MTR because there's also a transit route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| a CAT bus route that runs down Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| So the applicant is actually requesting RN2 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| so it's even lower than the medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| but it will still accommodate their needs to subdivide the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| and build adjacent homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| So staff is recommending approval of the RN2 zone district at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| because it's consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Do you want to move on to number 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Oh, number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| This is Turner Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| No, I'm sorry, number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| On Huber Properties on Andes Road south of Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| So this property is approximately 1.76 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| As Amy said, in the Ball Camp community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| it's southwest of the intersection with Ball Camp Pike in Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| It is not within the parental responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| and there are not sidewalks present along Andes Road in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| The applicant is requesting to go from planned residential of five dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| units an acre, and it's actually currently split-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| So the area that you just see the PR on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| it's planned residential up to five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| and the lower portion is planned residential up to seven dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| The applicant is requesting to go to planned residential up to 12 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| units an acre, and to accommodate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| they're also requesting a sector plan amendment for medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| You can see the sector plan map here where it's presently shown as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And this is where it is in relation to the Shod Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| So there are Andes Road intersection improvements that are proposed for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| We reached out to Knox County Engineering to discuss these improvements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| how they might impact this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| since this is a project that is underway currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| So we got these construction drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| and you can see in both the construction easement and slope easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| shown on this map where it says Huber Properties adjacent to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| that sort of grayed-out area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| that will be a construction easement and slope easement requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| So there are some considerations related to the Andes Road improvements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| You can also see a proposed guardrail that is noted along this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| and there is access also being shown going into this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| So the proposed driveway profile is shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| You can see it highlighted in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| There's a 19% vertical alignment that will be required to accommodate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| driveway at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| So there are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| some present challenges or challenges present related to the build-out at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| And partially because of these access challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| staff is recommending to increase the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| but only up to seven dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Also because it is a minor extension of the existing seven dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| per acre that's on the site currently and on the property adjacent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Staff is also recommending medium-density residential because it's a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| extension and it's closer to the neighborhood commercial node at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Are there questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| Liz, the 19% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| does that start at the property line or does it start at the edge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| pavement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I believe it's at the edge of the pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| but I might defer to our Knox County engineering colleagues if they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:19| You might want to raise that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Put that up here a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Yeah, Chairman Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| you can kind of see where it says 115,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| there's a line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| That's essentially showing the superelevation in the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| So where that break occurs would be the edge of pavement of the white line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| New Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| The reason that if you go out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| it's essentially flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| We've got to build it up over 20 feet high because we're building a grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| separated crossing with a bridge immediately to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I guess it would be the northeast of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| So it is going from very flat terrain to very steep terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| And we had acquired that easement from a previous owner prior to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Huber owning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| I might want to look that I had received a profile from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| Huber's engineer that was different than the one that Liz is presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| I was under the impression that that grade wasn't as steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So that may be something we may need to clarify with David Harbin because he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| he had previously showed me a profile that looked a little bit different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| that. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Cause you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| 19% Jim is awful steep coming into a major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| I agree that the profile that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Harbin sent me was approximately 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| So we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| we can clarify that there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| there's a discrepancy there and I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| I saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I just saw the profile yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| So we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| we'll find out what the issue may be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| we can move further down Andy's road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| So this is just down the street from the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| We were just discussing also in the ball camp community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| just a little further South down Andy's road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| This site is approximately 14 acres and has frontage on both Andy's road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| and Troutman lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| The forthcoming Chod road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| as we just discussed are within about 900 feet from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| The applicant is requesting a plan amendment to medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| residential from their existing low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| They're also requesting a rezoning up to seven dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| an acre from their existing agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| This parcel is between several planned residential zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| It extends down toward Troutman lane between two planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| areas that are zoned planned residential up to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| one to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| the buildout for those is slightly less than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| And while the forthcoming Chod road improvements are nearby and we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| anticipate additional development activity in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| We do think that this is greater than just a minor extension of medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| density residential down into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| So staff is recommending up to five dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| an acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| And we're recommending to deny the medium density residential land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| This staff recommendation allows them additional residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| more so than what is there currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| You can see the buildout density on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| If you have really good eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| you can see that the buildout at this one where I have the red cursor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| 2.3 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| The one on the east side is 2.4 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| And the one just north of this is 6.8 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| So the attached residential neighborhood again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| right here is a different development type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| obviously than these single family neighborhoods that are located adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| And this shows the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| the long range land use plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| So under medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| we could consider densities up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| for that reason we're sticking with low density residential as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| classification for the site and leaving our rezoning recommendation at up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| seven dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| which is still more than the current agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And also because this is slightly further away from this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| commercial node than the previous one that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Liz, did you mean five dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Sorry, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| I think you're still up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| So item number 12, last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| This property is approximately 5.4 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| It's on the West side of Oak Ridge highway in the ball camp or along ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| camp Pike and in the Solway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| It is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| appears to be landlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| but it is actually connected via easement to this Jim Jones lanes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| And it's also bounded on the East side by a railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| It is not within the parental responsibility zone of any schools and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| not sidewalks present in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| This is what the zoning map looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| The property is surrounded by planned commercial and across the street from CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| And this is what the land use plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| It's shown as general commercial in the area where they are requesting the CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| CB is allowed to be considered under that general commercial land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| classification and staff is recommending approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| And one of the reasons is because it is adjacent to a major arterial and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| railroad line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| It's also adjacent to existing uses that include a right away for the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| over highway right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| And then this red area that you see on the map is a commercially zoned self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| So staff is recommending approval of the CB. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| Yeah, I have a question. Liz, do you know, I mean, this may not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Do you know what they're wanting to do with the property and can they not use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| the planned commercial for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| Yes. So it's our understanding that they can't use the planned commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| The county codes said that they would need to rezone to CB for what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| I think that probably would be a good question for the applicant as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| what they intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| We've heard that they might want to do some sort of paint manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| But it's all contained, I think, within a structure on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| So there's not a lot of exterior sort of storage that's required for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:28| type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| What about using that access on Jim Jones? Is that an issue at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| So they they are aware of the site constraints and concerns at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| So, you know, they will have to address those as part of their building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| permit process when they start to work with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Liz, the area that's red that abuts the parcel, you said that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| currently a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| All the areas connecting to it are either a roadway or a self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1405)|

| 0:23:44| And staff is recommending three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| The applicant has requested five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:57| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:24:12| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| We're having some technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1453)|
| 0:24:27| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1467)|
| 0:24:36| So this is a rezoning application to be 22 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1476)|

| 0:24:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1482)|

| 0:24:54| This is a rezoning application to be 22 R.Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Can you pull this a little bit closer so we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| So this is a county rezoning application located at 9821| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Dutch Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| The application is to rezone from a agricultural to PR planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| A bit of context about this property is there's an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| There's an existing dwelling and an accessory building located on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| The property's located in a residential area with low and medium densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| Webb School of Knoxville is located to the south, approximately 650 feet away, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| the bottom left corner of this map to the southwest is Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1538)|
| 0:25:48| I provided a sector plan map for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| This property's land use classification is LDR, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| And here's a zoning map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| As you can see, the property's on agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| The surrounding zones include other agricultural properties, including RA and other PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| There's a collection of different densities ranging from 4.5 to 6 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| This is an aerial map that provides a little bit more context for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| So to summarize how we've approached this one, staff is recommending planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| zoning up to three dwelling units an acre instead of five, and this is consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| the northwest county sector plan and adjacent residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Given the lot size and shape of this property, it's a little bit unique and it's likely that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| development may be concentrated to the flag portion of the property in the rear, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| up against those single family dwellings to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| Here's one more slide that shows a little bit more about, like a little more zoomed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| The property is about approximately 100 feet wide, showing a little bit of the lot constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| There's a requirement for a 40-foot right-of-way width requirement, and all required setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| would also need to be met, including a five-foot interior side yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| So I just wanted to give a bit more context for this in a more zoomed-in map so you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| see that a lot of the recommendation is because it is a challenging shape and we think five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| dwelling units might be a little much of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| If you have any questions, I'd be happy to clarify information or answer anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:58| Let's move on to the next one, number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| This one we're sharing with you, I don't believe that we have received any specific comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| from the community on this, but in preparing for this week, we encountered an error in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| the staff report and the analysis, and so that is why you received an amended staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| So because of that, we are going to walk you through the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| It looks like we're having technical difficulty again, but we are recommending what the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| is requesting, which is five dwelling units per acre on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| At three units an acre, how large is the tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| Which one are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| He could get, what, four on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| He does want to do eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| I'm referring to item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| Has he said what he wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| That would be a question for the applicant on Thursday, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Okay, he hasn't, I mean, it's a rezoning, you can't condition it anyway, but still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| We can't, you know, if he was to show us a site plan, we can't go by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| So if he wanted to do five, that'd be okay, but if he wants to do eight, it's too crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| It really just depends on, once he gets into the concept phase, how much he can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| do on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| So we're recommending three based on the rationale that Levin presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| How large is the flag area back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| The length of it or the width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| The width is 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| The length of it, we'd have to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Are you wanting to know just the flag portion or the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Oh, the top portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| The top portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| What are the dimensions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Yeah, I have it pulled up here, I can just show you guys if you want, just to, just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| it's accurate for how we're approaching this with the mapping, oh, I'm sorry, F8, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:24| just do the calculation right now and just tell you guys instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I'm so sorry about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| It's approximately 0.74 acres, just the flag portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| It is how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Well, yeah, just the, yeah, just the top of the flag, yeah, okay, top of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Yeah, Levin, you want to move on to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Yeah, I can, if that's not what you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| So this is for case 2C22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| This is a county rezoning application located at 837 Murray Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| There's an existing single-family dwelling and manufactured home on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| The site is located to the north side of Murray Drive, a two-lane major collector road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| This application, the applicant has requested to rezone the property from agricultural to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| planned residential zoning up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| I provided a sector plan map for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| The property has a land use classification of low-density residential with some hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I also want to point out that there's some general commercial located to the south along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| This is a zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| The property is zoned agricultural and the surrounding zones include other agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| However, there's also properties located within the city nearby, including RN1, RN2, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| is directly across the street on Murray Drive, and CH1 located to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| Here's an aerial map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| It provides a little bit more context of that commercial area I mentioned along Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| Highway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| So staff are recommending to approve, recommend approval of planned residential zoning up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| This is consistent with Northwest City Sector Plan and surrounding residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| This property is located in a transitional area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| There's a church located to the west, commercial properties located to the south, which I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| and other single-family dwellings in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| There's also a CAT bus stop approximately 1,000 feet from the property to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| here, which is an effective distance to use and access public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| In addition, this property is located within the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| I know there might be a little bit of glare, but you can see a good collection of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| is located within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| The northeast is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| However, based on the location of the hillside and the steeper slopes and the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| development and this close proximity to Clinton Highway, the proposal of five dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| an acre seems to be appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| And here's just one more aerial photo I thought if I wanted to just take a look, and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| had any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Levin, can you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| What changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Because the previous recommendation was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| What did I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| We discussed this in a little bit more detail and got a little bit more into where the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2063)|

| 0:34:35| And there's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Here, I'll just go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| It's really a lot to do with the surrounding area, too, and having more density here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| We also looked again at the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Again, in the county, we only use that as a guide because it's not a requirement to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| follow those guidelines, but the numbers...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| We had to adjust the numbers in that slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| There was some incorrect numbers entered, and so that was one of the reasons that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| took a closer look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| My concern is just across the street, there are three developments that appear to be much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| lower in density, and maybe I'm misreading them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| The RN2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| It's hard for me to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| The one with the cul-de-sacs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| There are three cul-de-sacs subdivisions or developments that appear to have much lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| density than five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| I don't believe that we've run the calculations on the actual...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| The build-out of those, but in the RN2 zone, you can have lots that are a minimum of 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| square feet, and so I would say that that would be an equivalent PR up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2141)|
| 0:35:50| It would be similar to what would be a permitted, if not a little bit less, in the RN2, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| on specific site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| It's sometimes difficult to compare the city zoning to the county zoning, too, as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:36:11| because of the dimensional standards, there's a lot of differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Amy, I have that map that I showed you in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Is that something...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Do you have it electronically that you can share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I mean, I have it a printed-out copy right here, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| You can pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| I can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Is that okay to pass it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| So just to clarify what's being...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| The reason I just thought a paper copy right now might be okay is because I'm having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| little trouble with getting this sorted out here, but it shows approximately what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| build-out would be for the properties across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| So it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| I feel like I'm being a dullard, but I understand there are hillside issues, and so it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:37:02| corrected, hence the five dwelling units, but I'm having trouble getting my head wrapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| around just what it looks like on the map right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| The developments across the street just don't look like they've been built out to that degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| They look smaller, less dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| I think it might be helpful to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| I can see if I can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I'm just trying to find clarity, so that we don't know something there that's just out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:48| of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Well, you know, staff's recommendation is that we don't think it's going to be out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| character, given the close proximity to the commercial, and as a note, it's on a transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| And, you know, not that those houses in the RN2 zones would be torn down, but if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| were, I mean, even if they aren't as dense today, they could be built even more densely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| under that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And then you have RN1 just over that other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:20| Are the densities noted on this map, are they the built-to density or the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| That's what it allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Levin, once you're passing around, it might be helpful to explain, are these the build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| densities for each of the individual properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Is this what it's zoned to handle max, or is this what it's built to now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| That's what it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Built to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| So the zoning might allow more density that was unused, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| RN2, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| That's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| I didn't necessarily look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| One thing that sometimes...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| I think we should put more value on what something's zoned than what it's built to, because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| What it's built to can change, but the zoning is what the designation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| That make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| It sounds like it was not built out to the density that was allowed per the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| So this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Levin, are they planning...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| But we are talking about land use here, land use and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| So assigning the density to the property doesn't really have anything to do with the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| build-out of the property, what they chose to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I mean, you'll hear developers say they've asked for a certain density and they've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| it, but then when they get into the concept phase, they're not actually able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| out to that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| And again, the surrounding density is just one of the factors that we take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| when we're making a recommendation, and we encourage you all to do the same when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| make your final recommendation on the county commission or city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| Hey, Levin, are they planning on using the whole lot to build out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| Because it seems like it's a pretty steep slope right there in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| I'm not sure that we can answer that at this point, because the next phase of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| would be for them to actually do their layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| We would encourage them not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| There's a small portion on the, I guess, the south side that looks a little steeper to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| And that's one of the purposes of the planned residential zone, is to encourage people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| avoid those more environmentally constrained portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:47| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Okay, now we're going to switch it over to Mr. Reynolds, go over item number 16, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:40:57| is SB22C and the accompanying use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| This one is Mission Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| This one was postponed last month to allow for additional time to discuss and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| access to lots along Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:18| All right, thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:31| I'm going to, well, wait for this map to pop back up again, I think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| But, so I'm going to be real brief on this one since we did discuss it last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Just a refresher, there was an original 18 lot subdivision approved on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| They've revised their plan and have included five lots that front on Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:56| which is the entry road back to the Massey Creek subdivision behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| There was a previous, or another subdivision that was approved that kind of wrapped around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| this proposed site that included attached units that do connect to Mission Hill Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| The Planning Commission asked for us, for staff, to look at alternatives for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| to these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Condition number five was added that recommends providing two shared driveways, basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2542)|
| 0:42:31| four of the five lots would share two driveways, so two lots with a shared driveway, not two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| lots with a shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| The fifth lot would have its own independent single driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| This condition also recommends having a turnaround for each of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| This would help reduce any backing out into the subdivision road, generally increase safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2569)|
| 0:42:59| of those who are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Because of the width of Mission Hill Lane, the right of way of Mission Hill Lane, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| houses will sit back further than a typical subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| The houses will have, as recommended for approval, a 20-foot front yard setback from the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| of way line, which is typical for most subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| I believe Massey Creek's setback is also 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| But because of the width of the right of way, which is 23 feet wide from the edge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| pavement to their front property line, the houses will sit back about 43 feet from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| asphalt, so the driveways will be longer than typical, which would allow additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| off-street parking opportunities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| I know that was a concern for the Massey Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Mike, it might be helpful if you click on the site plan for this one, so folks can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| So, as you can see, the, so basically what I was saying is that the distance between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:44:06| the edge of the pavement to the front property line is wider than typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Usually on a 26-foot wide road with a 50-foot right of way, you're going to have 12 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| between the edge of the pavement to the front property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| In this case, we have 23 feet between the edge of the pavement and the front property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| line, so we have 11 extra feet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| So I'm just kind of bringing that up because it would provide additional off-street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| opportunities, which was a concern from the Massey Creek subdivision people, but with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| Speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| You speak up a little bit, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| It's really hard to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| I'll take it from the top, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| It's really hard to tell how loud you're speaking because I can hear myself really well right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| So, as I said, the 23 feet from the edge of the asphalt on our curb line on Mission Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| Lane to the front property line, so this is a wider right of way or, you know, space between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| there than typical, which would be about 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| So the houses themselves will sit back about 43 feet from the road surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| It's going to feel more open there than the typical subdivision road where the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| are a little closer to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| This also makes a longer driveway, more off-street parking opportunities, which was a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| from the Massey Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| It's a concern that has been brought up by the Massey Creek subdivision residents that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| if there's on-street parking, it could cause some additional safety concerns at their entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| But I don't, I just bring that up only because they, the driveways will be longer than typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:46:03| So anyway, if anybody has any questions on what the recommendation is, which is to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| two shared driveways, so four of the lots will share two driveways and then the fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| lot will have its own driveway, and each lot will have a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| So essentially...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| They'll go from five driveways to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| So there's, I'm thinking about what the residents were saying last month, and they just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| zero access points onto that main boulevard that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| So the recommendation is not zero, but three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| They don't really show the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| They're not showing on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| They would just, that would be something that would be worked out during the design plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| I mean, so there's nothing that says which of the four lots have to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| Does that come back to us for approval, where they put driveways in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| Yeah, so during the design plan phase, they would determine where those driveways would be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| But would that come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| We wouldn't need to see it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| We'll move on to number 18, 2SB22C, Tazewell Pike Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Just to provide some context, this property is in Northeast Knox County, out in the Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| area, so Gibbs Middle School, elementary school, high school, or just to the south on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2862)|
| 0:47:50| So this property was rezoned this past year to plan residential up to two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| The majority of the properties around it are zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| The property to the north, there's a property to the northeast that's zoned pit plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| There's a subdivision just to the east that is also developed with one acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| This plan concentrates the density to the southwest of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| So to show you, it's essentially down on the south part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| The northeast part of the property, I want to say, has eight to nine lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:41| I can't remember exactly which, but about half of the property is acreage-wise, total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| acreage is in this large lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| So the other half of the development is in the smaller, with smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| Go back to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| They do have two access points to Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| Their main entrance will be required to have a left turn lane on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| The other access point is a private road that only accesses three to four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| So you can see here that they would have to make this left lane improvement on Tazewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Because of the county sidewalk ordinance, they are showing a sidewalk on Road A up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| the Road C, which is this first crossroad within their subdivision, and they're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| showing sidewalks on the Tazewell Pike frontage on both parts of their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| And that's because of proximity to a park and also in the plant, they are in the parental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| The reason why they need to have a sidewalk or why that ordinance would require a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| on their main entry road is because this part of the road would have more than 1,000 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| So that's the criteria for requiring a sidewalk by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| The details of the sidewalk would be worked out during design plan phase, during permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| Staff is recommending one or a condition to install a stub out road to the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:27| or to the north, basically extending Road A right away through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| That is condition number seven, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:42| I didn't mention that this project does include both public and private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| So everything you see here with the smaller lots is all public roads where you see a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| shootout here which provides access to four large lots to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| That is a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| And then same thing on this little road here off of Tazewell Pike, that is also a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| They're asking for a 40-foot right away with a 20-foot driving surface which is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| for this kind of a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| Where's the stub out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Well, the stub out is not shown on the plan, but we're recommending that it be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| at the end of Road A. It is an extension to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| And really, this is the only property of size that surrounds the property that could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:46| have development on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| So that's the reason why we recommended the stub out in that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| And it seems pretty feasible based on the topography there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| It's relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| There's really no major constraints between the two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| So the 1,000, what is it, traffic per day to put sidewalks just starting halfway down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| So the 1,000 trips is theoretically people walking not on the sidewalk than to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| the sidewalk because it's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| And then we have a stub out where there could be future development where there might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| be sidewalks and then the sidewalks start again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| For the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| I mean, it's a kind of a tricky situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| And really, the sidewalks are, it is required as part of a county sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:49| And they do have discretion on requiring more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| So but this is the portion that the ordinance would say is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| So anything other than that is something that could be considered outside of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:07| Mike, the private road that leads into the four lots that are four large lots, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| those be re-subdivided later on in the smaller lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| They could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| Well, actually, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| With the density they're showing right now in the development, they're maxing out their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| density with the planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| So I mean, without rezoning the property to a higher density, they would not be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| unless they just didn't build some of the other lots somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| And also, the way that they designed this road, it's built to public right of way, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| it's a private right of way that doesn't have to meet all the public road standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| because once you hit six lots or more on a private right of way, then you have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| public road standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| This is less than five lots, or five lots or less on each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| So they don't have to meet all the public road standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| So they really couldn't improve or create many more lots there anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3259)|
| 0:54:28| What we're really doing is approving about four units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| Because if they come back and ask to rezone the other half of the property, we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| used up, just like Pat's saying, they are using up the density on half the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3284)|
| 0:54:56| So, you know, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| Yes, so they are concentrating density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| That's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| That's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| They definitely are concentrating density in the southwestern part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| There are some challenges on this site for developing, so if they did rezone this portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| over here and did improve roads and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| There is a creek that runs through here and then across the bottom of this hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| You know, extending or improving this road to road standard would be fairly difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| because of the steep grades coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| So they really would have to come off of Tazeville Pike if they wanted to do anything more out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| So I'd say it's never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| I mean, anything can happen, but I would say once this develops, it's probably going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Let's move on to item number 19, 2SC22C, Loy Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| It's located off of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:12| Sorry, I meant to just mention one more quick thing on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| You will hear from a neighbor here, just to the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| That is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| He was at the Planning Commission meeting when the rezoning happened and requested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| there be more buffers on his end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| He talked to me about it, and it was not something that was addressed in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| It was not considered as part of my review, so I just wanted to let you know that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| was somebody who had a concern, and you'll probably hear from them during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:58| 2SC22C, so the concept plan for Loy Farms on South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3418)|
| 0:57:07| This is out at the Choteau Road intersection or near it at the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| There's a commercial development just to the southwest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| This is zoned at Planned Residential up to 5 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| As you can see, kind of surrounding it, there are a lot of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| This little subdivision down here to the south is on Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| I think it's zoned at Planned Residential at 5 dwellings per acre as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| It's probably built out close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Adjacent to the south is a self-storage facility and a vet clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| and then some larger, a little bit larger lot development to the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| and larger house lot to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| There's some existing stormwater issues that the developer took into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| Right now, there's drainage or stormwater that kind of runs along this back property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| and has been causing some flooding issues in this neighborhood to the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| as well as into the property just adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| There's just not a great swale there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| There's not a lot of topography to work with, and so the water just kind of continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| So what they're doing is building up this back right corner, raising the elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| so the stormwater drains back to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| and then will carry stormwater along this property line back down to the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| Here's kind of where the Tennessee River and Fort Loudon Lake kind of begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| So they're kind of attempting to send the stormwater a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| to help with some flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| Let me go to the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| So this is primarily an attached residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| There's 50 attached units and seven detached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| This is a private road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| It has a 40-foot right-of-way requested with a 24-foot driving surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| Staff is recommending approval of a reduction of the peripheral setback in one location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| which is along the south North Shore Drive frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| This is something that I recommended that they request because what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| these are double frontage lots on south North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| so they are required to either have a 150-foot lot depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| or they have to provide a 25-foot common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| What they've chosen to do is do a 25-foot common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| But if you leave the 35-foot peripheral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| what happens is you'll end up having the 35-foot peripheral extend beyond the common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| 10 feet into these lots, and then the lots also have a 15-foot rear setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| and so you end up with two different setbacks on these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| which is not convenient for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| And really the common area does a whole lot more to buffer this development to North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| than the peripheral setback does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| And so that's why you're seeing that peripheral setback reduction to 25 feet along the North Shore frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3618)|
| 1:00:29| There is, you kind of see this little hatch line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| It's a sidewalk that's proposed along their frontage on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| There is a condition to require that to be widened to a greenway standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| which is what is in front of the Choteau Markets property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| There's already a greenway width sidewalk there that will be handled during the permitting phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3648)|
| 1:00:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| There's also a condition to require either a 10-foot non-disturbance area behind lots 4 to 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:08| or to install a type B landscape screening along this property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| to provide some buffering to the adjacent property or to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| Does anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| There is, well, anyway, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3684)|
| 1:01:35| Logan, do you have a mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I'll repeat it for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| The buffer that you just mentioned, where does that play in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| or when would that come into play with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| Well, so the way it's written, they would have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| If they can't do the grading plan and retain a 10-foot non-disturbance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:02:02| then they can go back with the planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| So it would just be during the design plan phase they would detail that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:19| Commissioner, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| There's no sidewalk in the subdivision, just the greenway on the north shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| Quite a few of the comments that we've gotten on this, a few concern the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:39| but mostly they're concerning north shore drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| And I was wondering, what are the plans for north shore drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3764)|
| 1:02:53| Dr. Snowden, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| Commissioner Graff, right now this section of north shore has no plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| We currently have north shore with the city all the way from Morrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| or pardon me, yes, from Morrell all the way to the roundabout at Concord Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| for improvements, turn lanes at key intersections and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| But this particular section isn't in any kind of plan necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| It is a location due to the access constraints with the way the bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| and the railroad kind of a little bit restrict access in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| We are asking as part of the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| the consultant to kind of look at that area a little more specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| But currently, sir, we do not have any specific plans for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Sorry, it's a ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Yes, sir. That's very correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| But the density is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| They're not, I mean, the zoning and the density is already on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Already been approved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And they fall within that density with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| I just wanted to briefly, I didn't mention this in my opening remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| but I wanted to share with you all that Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| and I had a conversation with County Commission regarding the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| to the planned residential zone at last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| This was an agenda item that was put on there by the Mayor's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| And the direction that we received was to hold off on any comprehensive updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| to that zone until we completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| the Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| which really does make sense, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| because there's bound to be items that will come up during that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| that will help inform any kind of code updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| that we would need to make after the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| So I just wanted to share that with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| Amy, does that include like a conversation about amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| that need to be allowed in the planned residential zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Yes, Commissioner, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| And so why that specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| why amenities need to be held off just in order to update the transportation plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| I mean, we anticipate, I mean, the county code is very dated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| as you all know, and it is anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| that there will be a comprehensive update of that zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| to implement the plan that is developed over the next 12 to 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| So there's bound to be changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| I guess my concern is just there's so many subdivisions right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| that we're approving concept plans for planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| and 12 to 18 months is a significant amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| I don't disagree. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| Any other comments from Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Are we adjourned for the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| All right, thank you. We'll see you on Thursday at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220208-agenda-review?start=3970)|
