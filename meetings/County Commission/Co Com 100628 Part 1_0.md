| 0:19:24| I think all of us have quite a few names of people that have called us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| The Chamber has submitted names and other people also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| We're going to probably start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| And since we have four people, if you want to nominate someone or two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| you nominate them until we get around to the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Of course, the audience will have an opportunity to nominate someone also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Then we'll go back and each person will be able to get four votes, your slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| Whoever gets ten votes, they're in because it takes ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| Does anyone have any heartburn with that procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Just a question, because I can see a lot of ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| And normally what we do is whoever receives the least number of votes drops off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| And I can see all sorts of different combinations and possibilities in trying to get through it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:30| I don't necessarily have a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| but we just need to make sure that, you know, if we don't receive nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| or if no one gets ten votes, it's so divided up that we might need to rethink it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:49| If after a few tries we may need to go to where we got position A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| and we'll take nominations and vote until you get someone filled in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and then position B and we'll take nominations and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| There's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Just throwing that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Chairman, you know, several commissioners I'm sure have names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Like I've got four names here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| When it gets to me, if none of my names have been mentioned, will I be able to mention all four or just do one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Well, when you vote, you'll be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| I think everybody should be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Vote for your four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I'm asking can he nominate four people during the nominating process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Sure, if they're not already nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| If they're already nominated, the names are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Not that I'd like to do it all in one block, but would that violate our rules of appointments by doing it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| in one block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I'd love to do it all in one block and get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| I checked with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| He's one of the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| He's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Looking at the original names submitted and thinking about what we discussed at finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Ms. Shriver and Mr. Gean went on in 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| So are they therefore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| They're not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| They're not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Their term limited then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Their names are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1334)|

| 0:22:18| Commissioner Ruth takes two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1338)|

| 0:22:30| The reason we submitted these names and that I'm here is we serve as staff to the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| and Health Education and Housing Facility Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Just two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| On the resolution, if our attorney said that if we could just make it noted that this is a six-year term starting on July 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:51| And then the other thing was I did want to mention that three of the nominees that were submitted by the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| are here, Shannon Hampson, Karen Hawthorne, and Pat Crumley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| in case you wanted to speak to them as well as the item's attorney in case you had a specific question related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:11| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1391)|

| 0:24:48| and I didn't know if those people were eligible for reappointment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1488)|

| 0:30:49| How many of them got 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Three up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| I missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| I have more than one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| Crippen's got 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So, we got one runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Stevens and Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| The vote is Patricia Crumley, 5, Stevens, 7, Meadows, 13, White, 16, Crippen, 14, and Thompson, 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:40| So, three of the people will be Meadows, White, and Crippen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| So, we'll take another vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| We need to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Will we drop the lowest vote getter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| We have been dropping the lowest vote getter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I believe that's what Commissioner Lutho said starting at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Crumley will drop off so we will vote between Stevens and Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:18| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Mr. Chairman, we have someone on the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Mr. Chairman, Herbert Slattery, 900 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I'm counsel for both of these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| The Director Development Board statute requires that a member of the chamber be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:44| that each director be a member of the chamber when appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| And we were just informed that Mr. Thompson is not a member at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| He's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| My understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| I think he has to be a member when appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| The statute, Commissioners, reads, does make reference to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| It says that the membership shall be members of a chamber of commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| board of trade, and other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| It follows up with this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Unless in the judgment of the governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| there are no members of such organizations who are both suitable and available to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| So if there is a member of the chamber who is both suitable and available to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| that person would get preference or precedence over someone who does not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| who is not a part of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Who would make that determination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| The determination of suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| The governing body would have to make a determination that there are no members who are both suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| and available to serve as directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| I guess my question is, is who does, I mean, suitable to whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| To the chamber or to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| To the body politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| I wish we had gotten this information a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| I really think it validates the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I think we need to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I hate to say that, but I think if we had gotten this kernel a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| we could have been further along the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| But I think at this point we need to, if we're going to scratch the name, we need to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| Can I ask one quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I don't have his resume directly in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Mr. Thompson, where does he work at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Where's, what's, Arthur, do you know where he works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| He works for Eaton Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| What corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Eaton Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Are they a member of the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Could you come to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| I'm certain he will join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| And if you want to have that issue clarified, postpone the final appointment until next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| But he works for Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Is Eaton a member of the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| I frankly do not know, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| They are a multinational corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| He's based here in Knoxville and has a very responsible position with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| He would be more than happy to join, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Probably did not know his company was not a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| The way that reads, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| means he has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| But it does not say before, before he's appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| It just says he has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Shell is a directive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| And their first meeting is when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| I guess when does the term start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| The term starts July 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| He would have to join before he takes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| It's a directive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| It says shell, and that means he needs to join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Good way for the chamber to get another member here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Well, I mean, I don't know if I think I said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I don't know if I read that that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| I'm not trying to be argumentative, but I don't know if I think it's up to us to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| is this person a good standing at the time that we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| And we're voting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| So, I mean, really, I don't have a dog in this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| The statute, excuse me, Commissioner, says if at the time of the election of any director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| And then, but it does say it shall be a member of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2212)|
| 0:37:01| Actually, it reads of any one or more of such organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| But there's no, there is a chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| and traditionally that's all that this body's relied upon are nominations from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Well, I realize the Board of Trade is an arcane phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Is there anything that is akin to that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| I mean, this commission is relying upon the names that are being vetted to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| We'd like to think that the names that are being vetted in this commission are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Are there any other people that aren't qualified that are being asked to be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Mr. Jarrett, Rhonda Rice, 17 Market Square, Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| The Knoxville Chamber of Commerce is the Board of Trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| It was established back in the 1800s as one of the oldest civic organizations there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| and has assumed the name of the Knoxville Chamber for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| So it's the same organization within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| The chamber is strictly trying to conform to what the statute says by submitting the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| Obviously, it's at commission's discretion to do whatever they wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| As to whether they join or not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| one would think that one would not want to join the Chamber of Commerce just to be nominated to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| but that it would do so as a public service to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Well, in looking at the qualifications of Mr. Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| it seemed like he is well more qualified, well, I won't say more, but just as, if not more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| than some of the others that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| I mean, the stuff that he's been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| What happens if we vote three today and postpone one until next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| You want to make that an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| I'll make a motion that we elect the three that have the highest votes now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and postpone the fourth one until next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Let me get a ruling by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| We just did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Oh, in terms of that postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| What do you think we need to go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Well, the problem is, as Mr. Thompson currently stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| if you do a strict interpretation of the statute, he doesn't qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| But he should be part of the Chamber or Board of Trade, which is now synonymous, at the time of his nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| So you could certainly take one off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| but that leaves you to basically going through once again an open selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| If no one else applies and by that time he is a member of the Chamber, then that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| But if in the interim others step forward that say we're dropped off but are likewise qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| then you'll be going through this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| So you're saying you think we need to start all over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| No, I think the three you have are duly qualified and I think you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| It's just this fourth one as to whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| It's not a matter of postponing it so he can get certified to serve and then be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| If you postpone that fourth position, then it once again becomes an open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| transparent selection process for qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| He doesn't have ten votes right now anyway, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| And as he stands, he doesn't qualify in terms of the statute, not his resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| And if you have someone out there who does, then you should move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| If you do have someone who actually fits the statutory criteria, you should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Well, I was going to thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I was going to ask the law director, getting back to my original question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| this is who decides suitable and is it just if we think Thompson is suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| and Stevens is not suitable, does that not make it conform to the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| and we can proceed on between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Or do you think that at this point in time, since the chamber believes Stevens is qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:15| and Thompson is not, then we should stop at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| Because we're the determining body as to whether someone is suitable to fill the position or not, are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| If you give the statute as plain reading, it reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| It talks about that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Then it reads, unless in the judgment of the governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| there are no members of such organizations that are both suitable and available as directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Now, it doesn't define suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| You can either interpret suitable to mean suitable in terms of comporting with the above requirements of the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| or just suitable in terms of a subjective analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| But that's the best I can tell you because this has not been litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| You know, essentially, you've got, that's the hand you've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Well, I guess to finish my question is, is that if we're voting for one over another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| obviously we're saying one is more suitable than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone is not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| So I'm just, I would just like to go ahead and finish this today one way or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| instead of having to go back and wait another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Could I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| I think this would clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| The decision of suitability and availability is a decision on whether there are any members in the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| that are not suitable or available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| So it's not a question of whether Mr. Thompson is suitable and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| It's a question of whether there are no members in the Chamber of Commerce who are suitable and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| I guess since you've brought forth this slate, then you're saying that he is both suitable and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:07| We have not brought Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| No, no, I'm talking about Stevenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Stevenson, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| So you're saying he's suitable and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Ms. Stevens is suitable and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| She's also a member of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| But we don't have any resume on her, so we don't know what she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| So what I'm saying is if this body decides she may be available, but we may decide she's not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| That's just your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| But that's our discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Whether you want to appoint her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| The issue, the way I'm reading your question is, is one suitable and available and another not suitable and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| The real issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| No, my question is if this body decides that although Stevens is available, this body might decide she's not suitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| and then that would open it up to someone outside of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Because you, because the chamber has not brought forth, because right now we have to drop, is it Crumley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| We have to drop Patricia Crumley from our list because she received the least number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| And so now we're down to a point if we feel like we need to go outside because of the availability part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:22| because we're out of names, if this body decides that Stevens is not suitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| then we'd have to go to someone outside of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Yes, but you're, when you go outside the chamber, you're saying basically that there are no members who are suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| and available for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Well, I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| And you've been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| But the availability is those that have been, their names have been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Well, the chamber's submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Because we can't vote on, no one else is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| No one else has been nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| The chamber has submitted, well, eight names, but you've reduced that to six who are suitable, who are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2694)|
| 0:45:02| In the chamber's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| Not this body's opinion, necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| I'm not trying to degrade anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I'm just trying to get down to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Well, if none of the names are available, then the recourse would be to send that back to the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| and say we need to bring another slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Or we need to provide the list of the chambers and you need to look at it and say none of those are good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:28| Well, we've already decided on three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Now we're getting down to whether or not out of what's available, and I interpret that, and I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| I'm not an attorney, I'm interpreting that as those that have been nominated and brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| No, the statute is, forces the commission to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| there's nobody on the chamber membership list that's suitable and available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| and therefore we're going to appoint somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| So if we were to delay this until next month, then you would bring back a whole new slate, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| You'd be in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Well, we could if you direct us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| But, yes, we would need to make our, I guess our memberships, you know, available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| You can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| But it's your determination that none of those people would be satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| Then you appoint somebody outside of the chamber membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Mr. Napier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| How many people are on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| How many are women?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Let me get the list so I don't misspeak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| We've got currently one, two, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| And Ms. Shriver is one of the names up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| And just if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| What you're saying, Ms. Shriver is no longer going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| So right now we've only got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| How many are other minorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Deborah Stevens is a member of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| She's qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| And I say this with great love and respect in my heart for all of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| and everyone who volunteers to serve in any level of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| But we've got too many middle-aged white men on these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| It would be great if we had some more women and some other minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| And I hope that going forward we will all do a better job of trying to recruit more diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| onto these boards and into government because I don't think we are doing a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| of making sure that these boards truly reflect the makeup of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| So I'm going to suggest that we move on ahead and elect Deborah Stevens to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| A couple of questions, if I might, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Mr. Law Director, if Mr. Thompson is not a valid candidate, then do his nine votes matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| If he is not a valid candidate, should his name be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| and those votes be declared null and void?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Yeah, at this juncture he is not a qualified candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| As such, he should not be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| So basically we have two candidates to be considered, Deborah Stevens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| and Patricia Crumley, is that correct, if we vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| If those, if they meet your criteria, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| How do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| We don't have any resumes on either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| There was on Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| She's at Pinnacle Bank, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| We submitted electronically those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Yeah, there is on Ms. Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| We have a resume on every one of them, plus I've got copies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Someone would like a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Mr. Napier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Hold on, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| My concern here is that I don't know why we have such an issue with this every time this comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| but it seems like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| My issue is, and I don't know Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| I really don't know Ms. Stevens and Ms. Crumley that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| I think we may have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| It sounds like the perception, I believe, is that we're trying to bend the rules to favor a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| I'm against that, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| I believe that we need to go ahead and vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| If our law director says that Mr. Thompson is not a candidate, he's not a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| He can be brought up at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| I would like to go ahead and vote on the qualified candidates that we have brought before us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And that's all I will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| And I'll relinquish the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Commissioner, Mr. Napier, I'd like to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Hold on, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| You're coming up after Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| I'll go ahead and pass because my feelings are the same as Commissioner Hammond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Okay, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I agree with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I don't want to bend any rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| But I want to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| How many of these people personally belong to the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| and how many of them is it their company belongs to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| That might be a better answer by Rhonda Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| I believe most of the names that were submitted are company members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| There are more company and organizations as members than there are individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| I used to belong to the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| My company did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| You still do as Knox County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| But what I was going to say is how do we know the question that, Lord have mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:33| Yeah, whether Eaton Industries is a member or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I received Mr. Thompson's resume this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| And I'm sure he's a fantastic individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| I do not know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| But we went through our complete database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| And as an individual or as a company, which we can check both ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| he is not registered as a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| You're saying Eaton is not registered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Commissioner Upper, I couldn't even think of his name that brought that question up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| You know, if Mr. Thompson were here, and I'm the one that nominated him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| if Mr. Thompson were here, he could simply walk down the street and join the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:20| Since he's not here, I'm going to acknowledge that he probably is not qualified to take this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| I wish he were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| And for folks watching us on television, if you're ever interested in an appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| it would certainly pay you to be here with the body that is going to appoint you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| because this is something very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| If Mr. Thompson were here, he could walk down the street, he could fill out the paper, pay his dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| And considering that he has nine votes, he would probably win this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| But since he's not here and he's not eligible to serve, as the person who nominated him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| I choose to withdraw the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| And I wish he was here, because if he were, he could have rectified this very simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| But I'm going to withdraw the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| Well, since he's withdrawn, my question was, Rhonda, how much, Eden, that's a pretty big place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| How much would that membership be for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| It's not a strict base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| It's based on the level of benefits that the company would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| He could be a base member at $350 or he could escalate his dues according to tiered benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| But the company itself is, it's a big company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Yes, sir, I'm quite aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| But our membership fees are not based on the size of your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| I recall from, I haven't got my laptop up here, but I recall Ms. Crumley was a vice president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| or financial advisor of something at Pinnacle, I believe, in the North Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Does anyone know what, recall, Deborah Stevens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| He said she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Let her speak for herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| She's an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| So my preference is that we vote for either Ms. Crumley or Ms. Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| And I understand and agree with what Commissioner Burrell says down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| I'd like to see more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Since Ms. Shriver is rolling off, I would certainly hope we would entertain this position for a lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| And it looks like that's who's left to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| So I hope we can vote on both of them personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| One more comment, following up on Commissioner Lambert's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| that it would help if people who are interested in positions would show up for the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| I think it's also important to remind them that they need to know what the qualifications for that position are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| and make sure that they meet them before they submit their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| I think what I'm hearing from the majority of people that we go vote again for Crumley or Stevens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| because Thompson is not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| Does anyone have any heartburn over what I just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| We have two nominees, Crumley and Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| So we're going to start in the ninth district for our fourth person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Commissioner Pinkston votes for Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Commissioner Brown passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Patricia A. Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Commissioner Wright votes for Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Commissioner Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Commissioner Armstrong votes for Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Commissioner Carringer is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| I still have four votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Patricia Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Commissioner Smith votes for Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3293)|

| 0:56:35| Chris Edders, 6210 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| I just want to read a short letter addressed to Chairman Thomas Strickland, June 28, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:49| Dear Chairman Strickland, this letter is to inform you my resignation as co-chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| and member of the Knox County Ethics Committee effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| I've enjoyed my work and time spent on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| and appreciate the other committee members along with Knox County Commission's confidence in appointing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| Sincerely, my name, Chris P. Edders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| I just wanted to come because I was appointed by the commissioners and came that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| I'm going to use that little insert there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| But not to be self-serving, but that I wanted to come personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| and look at everyone on this board and say thank you for supporting me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| and thinking enough of me to nominate me for the last 14, 16 months of my service to the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| which I think in some cases have done some good and questionable, but I think good things here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| And Godspeed be with the commissioner and everything that you all decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I checked with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| Mr. Law Director, and this is the mayor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| So I'll begin with Mayor Ragsdale for another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| I'll have to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Mr. Chairman, before Mr. Edders leaves, I'd just like to make a statement that he served on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| the way that all citizens and I think that would expect him to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| There was no self-interest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| He always voted his conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| He represented the citizens of Knox County without really representing any other interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| And I really think that he's the model type person that we want on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| And I hope we probably can't find anyone any better, but I hope we can find someone almost as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| So I want to say again, thank you again, Chris, for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| You were really an asset to the committee and for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| I just want to mention to Mr. Edders, Chris, before you get gone too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| Can you come down here to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Quit running around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| He's trying to sneak out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| Hang on to that podium a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| I'm like Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Chris, just thank you for your service, for what you have done for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| Not for Chris Edders, but for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| And I've watched several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| I've attended several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And I'm like Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| I mean, you're a first-class act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| You have your hearts in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| It's for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| I hope that take a little break, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| and maybe we'll find something else for you to do as a public service for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Just you and your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| What your company does for Knox County is just tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| But I really appreciate you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| And I was going to ask then, so if there's something else he can do for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| can I ride in the dump truck and it howls Christmas parade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| I've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Dress you up as a green elf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Next on the list is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| While everybody's bragging about Chris Edders, a lot of people don't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| He used to be in the mulch business years ago when I dealt with Chris Edders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| And it was always a class act to deal with Chris back years ago when I used to order mulch from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| So I thought I'd give my shout out to Chris as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| It's amazing how many people in Knoxville have been around the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Our next mayor is one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| But he's a good guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| I'd vouch for him any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Jolie, if you would be kind enough to patch me into the big screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| Pam Reeves mentioned that there were some issues that I did not disclose to her that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| and there's a lot of issues I didn't disclose to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| This is one of them that has been unsealed that I'm allowed to speak about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| It has to do with some questionable invoicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| Knoxville Zoo hauls one dumpster load a week of manure to Solway or they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:24| And the Solway contractor NRR would bill Knox County for those loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:33| I've been looking at some questionable invoicing, a lot of questionable invoicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| This is just one invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| This is the invoicing for zoo loads for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| There are two pages of it, 60 loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| I have reviewed the zoo's records and the zoo said they only sent five of these loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| I actually obtained the scale tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| These were legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| They correspond with the zoo's records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| This one is a bit questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| The zoo says they did not send any compost this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| They only send about one load a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Yet you see this load on a day the zoo says they didn't send any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| But if you notice, this same gentleman is back with another load one minute later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| He's made it to the Knoxville Zoo and back in one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And a couple of minutes after him, somebody else shows up with a load from the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| that the zoo says don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| This guy, likewise, is back in a minute with a fourth load that didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| And then here comes a fifth load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| All these are on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| And then Stanley's back here again with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| And you get the gist of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Here's this guy that was there just a few minutes, maybe 30 minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| and now he's back with a third load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| I audited this one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| I found 55 such scale tickets on loads of manure that the zoo is adamant did not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:08| I spoke with Rodney Rocket concerning this invoice and some other invoicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Mr. Rocket has informed me that he's fairly certain the people who signed these scale tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| on loads of manure that never existed work for Bruce Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| Now, I thought you all might want to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Here also in Ms. Reeves' report is a statement where she lays out how Mr. Weitrick was informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| about contaminated mulch that had been sold at Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| If you notice, she mentions that Mr. Weitrick did not know if any consumers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| who had purchased those products were advised of the potential problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Well, that information was withheld from you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| I thought you might want to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| These are little things that I thought you all needed to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| But here's one that's a recent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| You know, everybody was told that engineering never tested the groundwater back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| when we were having these spills and the ponds were leaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| Well, that turned out not to be the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| Bob sent a letter complaining about his well and the springs near the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| and his concerns that his well and the neighborhood springs were being contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| About a week after he sent this letter, your engineering department tested those springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| and there's the lab test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| They were contaminated with high levels of E. coli and fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| You didn't get this information neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| There's a lot of information that was withheld from this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| and I'm sure all of you all are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| In Ms. Ree's report, she makes statements how Mr. Weitrick became aware that John Evans was allowing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| to keep your revenue sharing money, but didn't discipline Mr. Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| and withheld this information from you all knowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| What else was withheld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| And I didn't know if any of you all had bothered reading page 57 of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| but I'm going to go down to it real quick and I'm going to quote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:27| Salter admits that he did drive by Mays' business and home on occasions during that time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| and that he may have had occasion to stop in the school parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Although he believes it was to check his e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| Rocket has indicated that Salter was so obsessed with Mays'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| that he had an aerial map of Mays' residence on the wall of his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| Let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| I live in a dead end subdivision all the way in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| And back when I was trying to litigate this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I'd see Mr. Salter's truck come by my house two or three times a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| and he's admitted it to Ms. Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Has Mr. Weitrick counseled Mr. Salter about stopping these activities of driving by my business and home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:18| What has been told to Mr. Salter to stop this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| There's a lot more questionable invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| I'm just sharing with you one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| This is going to be huge when we get to the bottom of all these invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| But I'm just really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| My wife, my family is upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| We have someone that had a history of driving by our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| I've seen him on multiple occasions parked across from my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| I have pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| What has been done to counsel this person to ensure that they don't drive by my business anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| don't drive by my home anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| I guess I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| For the past month, Mr. Salter started driving by my business again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Reg, you need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| It's got my family very upset and something needs to be done about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Bruce, let's jump in here, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| This has been going on for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| Brad, do you have some pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| You talked about this, the drive-by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Bruce, I don't know if you're aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I've talked to Mr. Salter to make sure that if he was going by there not to go by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| When did you talk to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| My solution to the problem is the same thing I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| If I thought someone was sitting outside my house or driving by my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| I would pick up the phone and dial 911 and have the sheriff's department come out and investigate what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| Now, Mr. Mays' business is on Middlebrook Pike, I believe, or Lovell Road, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| Those are major routes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| People drive up and down there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| You can get a photograph of a vehicle going down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| But if he thinks he's being stalked by Mr. Salter or he's by his house when he shouldn't be, do like I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| But I can tell you, I can assure you, I would not come down here to County Commission to complain if I had a car sitting across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| I'm going to call 911 and have the sheriff's department come out and investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Brad, did you have something that you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| When did you tell him, talk to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Or have you said anything to him about not going by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| I just made sure that if he was going by there not to go by his house or his place of business if he didn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| And when was that, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| This has been months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Now, clearly, Mr. Salter, he lives out off Middlebrook Pike also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| So he has to drive down Middlebrook Pike and Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| And in some cases, going to Dutchtown Convenience Center or other places, he has to use that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| But if he's out in his dead-end cul-de-sac sitting out there for hours on end, pick up the phone, call 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| sheriff's department will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Brad, did you have anything you wanted to show about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| I just wanted to make the following statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| that Salter should be warned of any further behavior of this type would be grounds for disciplinary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| Mr. Salter does not live past my business on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| There are no convenience centers past my business down Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| I can't think of a legitimate reason why you would need to go past the Lovell Road intersection to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| and pass my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| But this has happened several times in the past month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Now, granted, you know, he might be on legitimate business, but if that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| he needs to find an alternative route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| With what all has happened, he needs to find an alternative route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| This is getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| And the fact that in the past he has admitted to going to the back of my dead-end subdivision on multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| And parking across the street from my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| I think that it's not asking too much for this gentleman to find an alternative route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| There are many times my wife has to work there by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| This is completely out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| You have the pictures you were showing about going and turning around, going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Yes, I have some here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Can you share that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Yes, I can put them up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| It's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Here's some that I took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| And I saw a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I thought it was Mr. Salter going up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| And I saw it go up around the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| You can see it there turning right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| When was this, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| This was just a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| I believe it's the same truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Turned around, came right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| There it is at the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Coming back through again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Passing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Here's one right out in front of my business in the turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| This one my wife took trying to get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| You know, it's just uncalled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| My wife works there by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| I have a teenage daughter and I have what I believe credible information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| He had pictures of my house on his wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| I've witnessed him in my subdivision back in 08 two or three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| He parked across the street for hours on end back in 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| I've got another little piece of something you all like to have that I got the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| One of the major reasons I started looking at Ball Camp Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| the 2008 officer of the year warned me of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| and provided me with this affidavit the other day where someone had been photographing my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| and had photographed him talking to me at my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| And he saw the pictures when he was at NRR and was confronted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| and he specifically told me whoever's taking the pictures are taking them from Ball Camp Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| This was in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Immediately after he told me this, I noticed a truck over at Ball Camp Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| that had been there all summer several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| I snuck over there and got pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| I snuck in behind it, up behind the retaining wall so I can get the license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| That's the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| This is what, you know, to me this is human resources at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| How can we discipline this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| What do we have a county employee stalking people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| We need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Sitting there for four hours stalking somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| You know, I can't prove that whoever sat in that truck took the pictures that Officer Johnson witnessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| but I just know that he told me the pictures were taken from Ball Camp Elementary playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| and I started watching and this white truck was over there at the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Commissioner, if there's a vehicle, a county vehicle parked anywhere for any length of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| there's several recourses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| You can call the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| You can call my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| We get those calls from time to time about vehicles being placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| I've got a call the other day about one of our vehicles parked at Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| because they were carpooling to go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| It's just that simple matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Middlebrook Pike is a major route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| It's a public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Was that his truck that was sitting there across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| I can't tell from where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Is that his license number, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| I have the registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| What I'm trying to say is if you think there's somebody up to no good, call the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Call 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| The Sheriff's Department will come out there and they will find out what that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and why that individual is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Well, and Bruce, here's where I'm at with it, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| You know, we've been talking about this for a year, year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| We're talking about the same county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| And it seems we've got a county employee that is stalking somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| And I think Human Resources needs to look into this or your department needs to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| We need to stop harassing the citizens if this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| They followed this reporter in his car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| The same individual followed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| If they feel like they're being stalked, that's a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| They should call the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Well, I think you as department head, you need to put your foot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I can't follow anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| In public service, not public surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| I can't follow every vehicle we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| But I'm not going to tell my vehicles that they can't drive down Middlebrook Pike or Lubbock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| Bruce, you're the leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| We're not getting into an argument here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| Did you have something, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Yeah, and it's along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| You know, we've all heard these issues with NRR and the Solway facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| And we'll let those settle themselves out in court, but this is a horse of a different color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| If we can manage our staff, I would hope that we as a county entity can manage our staff to a point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| we can tell them where to go and where not to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Okay, I'm not going to argue the Middlebrook Pike thing, but if there are any facilities that Mr. Salter has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| beyond that point, I don't see a point in purpose for him going beyond that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| That's me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| I'm not his manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| If it is an issue, and hopefully it sounds like Ms. Reeves has pointed out some things that you now have some tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| to go and manage this employee, hopefully he's within the HR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| I'm sure you all can't speak to that, but I would hope that as a manager, some things have been proven to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| It is incumbent upon you to take certain actions as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| And hopefully that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Don't know, don't, you know, it's not our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| That's private matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| But hopefully that process is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| But to say all you can do is dial 9-1-1 and you're his boss, I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| And I'm not trying to get argumentative, but that's just a statement of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| You can manage his daytime movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| If that's a county vehicle, we can manage that county vehicle 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| And you say, if this license plate is seen beyond this point to this point, you're going to go to step two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| step three, step four, whatever in that HR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| So, you know, again, the whole issue is aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| If this is a harassing environment, we need to take strong actions to don't even show the appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:49| of being in a harassing environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Mr. Salter lives off Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| That is his way to come and go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| So there's a legitimate reason for him to be on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| And that's where he lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| He lives off Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| So you're going to see his truck go up and down Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| If you see a vehicle, any county vehicle, sitting somewhere for an extended period of time, call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| Right, but I guess I'm going to do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| If you feel threatened by any vehicle, whether it's a county vehicle or any other vehicle, call the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| Okay, well, there's some findings in Mr. Reed's report that says, hey, he admitted he may be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| Again, if there's an issue, we need to manage the issue, my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| We need to manage harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| If it is harassment, we need to investigate and say yay or nay whether there's harassment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| I just wanted to point out one thing to dispute something Mr. Weitrich said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| Mr. Salter does live off Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| And I discussed this with Mr. Rockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I don't know where Mr. Salter lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| But from what I understand, he lives much closer to town than where I'm located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| He would have to pass his house up to get to my business on his way home from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| Yes, something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I'm Larry Vandert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:08| That time that you were followed, did you get positive ID that that was him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| You've got a microphone right there, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| Larry Vandert, 820 Black Rock Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Tell them what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Well, as I was leaving the convenience center in Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| there was what appeared to be a white county truck pulled out behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| I couldn't identify the driver, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| That's essentially it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| But tell them where all you went and where did that truck go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| What did that truck do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Well, the truck followed me, I guess, back down to Mainville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| where I then turned north and went back toward Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| And I lost sight of it after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| But didn't you tell me it followed you into the bank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| Well, I passed the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| You know, you have to pass a bank there on, what is it, Cunningham Road, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| I passed the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Actually, I think that's where I first --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| It's been a while here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| Yeah, actually, the truck did come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| I had gone through the bank and then back out to Cunningham Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| and the truck was behind me at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| But I lost sight of it once I got on Mainville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| Do you have anything else, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Commissioner, next we have Patrick Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:47| Patrick Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| He may want to speak when we get to the Capitol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| Anyone else that would like to speak in public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| 9-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| requesting that the Knox County Commission review the City-County Public Building Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Parking Committee report and determine which recommendations, if any, the Commission is desirous of adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:24| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| I'm waiting on it to scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| We have some of the committee members here that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| Commissioner Smith, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Yeah, Commissioners, this is something that several of us have been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| Where is Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Dale, do you want to come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| And Lucille, is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| Chris is on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| While Dale is coming, I'll let Dale give the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| A lot has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| I've been looking at the City-County Garage for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| A committee was formed from the county side and the city side, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| and got with PBA, and so we want to give you the report here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| and we'll discuss the findings that you've got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Go ahead, Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Well, Commissioners, as you know, there have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| I need your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| I'm sorry, Dale Smith, work address 400 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| I work with the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I would, I guess, preface all this by saying that this isn't certainly my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| It's the committee's of non-members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| They had asked me at the first meeting to chair and provide data to the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| and so I guess that's the reason I'm standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| There have been at least one past committee back in 2006 that's basically their sole charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:21| in that committee was to look at whether or not to reopen the garage to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| This committee actually originated from a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| or meeting that Commissioner Hammond and I had in Richard Wall's office probably a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| and a half ago, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| And its charge was intended to be broader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| and that was that its charge was to look at the issue of opening the garage or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| but also more specifically to look at a number of inequities that had developed over the last 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4972)|
| 1:23:00| or 30 years and who paid for parking, who didn't pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| how much one employee group paid versus another employee group paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| And so that is why certain issues were addressed here that have not been addressed by past committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| And in that conversation with Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| it was obvious, I think, that PBA sort of had the accountability of running the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| but did not have anywhere near the authority to address those inequities in pay and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| And so I think the recommendations the committee made were, from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| unanimously agreed upon by the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I would like to compliment everyone on that committee in that they came into the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| and continued through our whole effort to be extremely ethical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| extremely fair, and extremely tough in some respects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and not just buying some of the one-off deals that have developed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| So the recommendations, I hope you've had a chance to at least scan them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| and I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| And Ms. Lucille Griffo was the citizen member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| She was here earlier but had to leave for an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| But Chris Caldwell, as well as Commissioner Smith, were the county representatives on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| And Deputy Mayor Larry Martin represented the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| And Ms. Marilyn Roddy represented city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| I'd like to ask you a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| It's been about a year, year and a half ago, that I caught some of these people up here in this building had two passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| They've turned them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Does anyone else have two passes now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Probably me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| One in my motorcycle and one in my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| But that's a-are you talking about people that have-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| They had two passes, you know, and I felt like they were giving one to their friends to get in free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| I believe, Commissioner, that that's been eliminated entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| Then there's another thing that I've noticed, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| You know, I brought it to your attention how some people were taking two parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| You know, and as crowded as that garage is, we don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| I came in this morning and there was a Chevrolet pickup truck down there had taken up two parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| I know you're probably understaffed, but I would like for one of your employees to at least walk that twice today, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| of a morning about 930 to see when people come in, how they're parking, and write tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| We really need to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| We actually have been enforcing it pretty stringently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| In fact, I've gotten a lot of kickback from people thinking we're being too tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| But we-if you ever see a vehicle like that, and this is true of anyone in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| just call 52246 and tell them where it is and they'll have a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| But we do walk-that garage is patrolled every morning at least twice looking for exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| Well, I have called and reported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| That's what got me on it, and you've taken care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| But I just noticed this morning, I didn't know whether you were walking it regularly or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| But as narrow as those parking places are down there, we don't need some employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| or someone down there taking up two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| In fact, a lot of those people have been doing it intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| But I'd say 99 percent of them got religion when we started that campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| because they did not want to walk from Kessel every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:37| Do you have something else, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Commissioner, do you want to explain to the people or to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| and people at home about the number of spaces that we hope that we're going to free up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| and what we're going to do about some people that were having their vehicles here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| and then having to pick up what were going to the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Can you explain that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| This is something that we have been working and doing with the city for about the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| and that as part of the effort to reduce the number of take-home vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| and an unintended consequence of that was that in many, many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| then we had the government vehicle sitting here in the garage in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| and then we had the employee bringing their private vehicle in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| And in the city's case and what we are working with Chris Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| and the county administration on is taking vehicles that are not assigned to an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| they're often pool vehicles, code enforcement, those types of vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| having them park over at the Coliseum and the city is quite willing to have them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| And so when the employee needs to go access that government vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| they take their POV over to the Coliseum, pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| We estimate, I believe Chris Caldwell's estimate was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| we think about 80 vehicles that would be able to be relocated over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| We have, as you know, many mornings we are oversubscribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| And so if we were able to relocate 80 government vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| what the committee recommended was we would issue up to about 65 parking passes to individuals who want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:22| but have not been able to get into this garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| and let that 15-vehicle difference help the overcrowding problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| We think that will eliminate the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| You know, Mr. Chairman, one of the last things I want to mention, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| is the committee was really thorough on what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| You know, there were people that were parked at the old courthouse that got to park for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| Those people are paying to park now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Even the people in the police, what is it called, the portico, is that it, Dale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| in the sheriff's department that were the top supervisors, even those, they agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| Hey, you know, they wanted to be a team player, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| They said, you know, we pay to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| I ask that everybody that works here in the city county building will be paying to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| Yeah, one minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Since this did not come before this body, we have not changed those yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| But with your approval, we would make sure that all full-time employees that are parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| including in the Sally Port, including, in fact, the old courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| our recommendation was, I think, suggested initially by Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| was make those limited term handicap spaces and bring the people like Greg McKay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:36| and the clerk, the county clerk, have them park in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| But basically, I think the biggest issue here of the effort was try to get equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| so that any full-time employee parking here was paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| There still are a few people in the judiciary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| and in the constitutional offices that will need to get on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| But with your approval, I think that won't be difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| And the people with the sheriff's vehicles come to court, they will not pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| You know, the officers that come in, they will continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| because they're here just a little bit and then leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| But does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| I just have one question, Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| With the county employees that are here that are going to pay the full amount for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| which is fine, will they have the option of parking at the city where the county is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| Is there a charge over there for city county to park at the Coliseum and then ride the trolley over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| To my knowledge, that's still free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| But I don't remember the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| So if somebody that works here does not want to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| Larry, does the Coliseum charge anything now or is that free or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| That was 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| That's 15 at the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| If they choose to do that, they don't have to buy a parking pass here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| They can choose to park over there and ride the trolley over to the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| And, in fact, we assume that as the employee rates increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| that's one of the recommendations here to $60 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| that there may be employees at that point that are unwilling or unable to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| And they would have the option of going to Kessel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| which the county mayor said he intends to leave at $30 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| or go to the Coliseum for $15 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| So there are low-cost alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| But, obviously, if you want the convenience of remaining in this garage, it's going to start to cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| I think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| And, Dale, the price hasn't gone up in how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| It's been 20 years, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Over 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| I couldn't find anybody that's been around longer than that to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| If you came at it, he'd be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5512)|

| 1:32:21| Mr. Chairman, if we're going to consider a break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| I sure would appreciate it if we'd go ahead and do number 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=5544)|

| 1:47:25| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| Is anybody here from the property assessor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| Bill is right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| I think he works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| On occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| It looks like it's commission day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:59| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| The contract, are you satisfied with the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| with the provision that we pay a fee to this company at $15,000 in assessments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:18| I guess actually appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| Because that only brings in $106 at that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| And we're probably, once you average everything out, we're going to be paying them $250 per account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| although it says that they'll only pay up to the amount of taxes collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| You throw a few big ones in there and then the small ones that end up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| we're still paying $250 for something that's going to be bringing in $106 is what $15,000 brings in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:50| And, you know, as we know, the hardest companies to keep open are the small ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| and $15,000 is pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| I don't know that we'll even collect two years out of some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| to even try to recapture the $250 we've paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Well, Phil Ballard, property assessor, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| Now, you know, as you listen, as you discuss this, I was going to let Jim Weaver do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| but since you've got me here, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| So if it comes to numbers, I'll let him sort of look at that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| But, you know, it goes from a moot point to a stoop point that you bring out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| and I guess as a trustee you understand their appraisal and their percentage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| One thing, though, that what we hope to do is get it on the books so we can get it on the tax bills by October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| which is going to be, I think, a pretty good sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| Two is last year at Christmastime I offered a very minimal stop it to see who can come up with the most tangible personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:58| And they went at it pretty good, but out of that they only come up with 115 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| And now, you know, this was done after hours by the telephone, by the computer, by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| We have anywhere from 17,000 to 20,000 accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| The downside is, sort of as you point out, is that almost 4,000 to 5,000 is not and has not been collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:23| That sum has run to over $200 million now, which is $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| I think, and I've talked both to Troy, you're seeing Larry Martin sitting out here, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| that I think in our audit process that we can do a little better job working with the trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| where that more of this money is collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| What do I think that they'll uncover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| I'm sort of with Jim Weaver that we're tossing out a little number less than 2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| but really and truly it may be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| And if it is, that's to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| The technology that Mr. Finbar has talked about, hopefully we won't need this service right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| We're not connected between real and tangible personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| And we suspect that they might be upwards of 25% after we get this new system in place that we can tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:14| that we wouldn't need their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| But I do think maybe later on you might hear from me coming back forward that we're able to do our audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| a little bit different where we don't have $2 million laying out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| And I think that's part of education between the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| Am I satisfied with the $15,000? I think that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| It's not necessarily a moot point, as you've pointed out, but they also have to have an incentive to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| They have had the massive bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| The pressing point for our bank commission and myself is that we get it on the tax row so that we can get the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| Now, this doesn't eliminate any work by the property assessor because we're going to look at each account and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| So we've got a lot to do after they turn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| And also we've insisted on their assistance to go out and verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| And I didn't know who would be here today, but the owner of the company is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| And I think that he has a decision if there's any other recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| If you're not satisfied or if you might want to look in a little bit different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| But we did put in the $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| They've only went as high as $5,000 in any of the locations that they've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| So we've been pretty demanding of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| How far we can stretch it beyond that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| Okay. But you're satisfied with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I'm satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Okay. That's what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Yes, Phil, what I'd like to make clear here, a lot of people don't understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| we hope they find a lot of accounts like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| And this could, well, it will, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| It may cost us a little bit the first year and it may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| We still may make money on the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| But after that first expense, from then on, it's all county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| This is a good business deal for Knox County here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| I say that we're not in the business to make money, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| but we do make sure that people want to pay their fair share of the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| If there are due, we want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| And, again, I think there's a big education process that people don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| Once they're billed, they ask questions, they don't feel, nobody wants to pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| That's correct, me especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| But once they learn that they are collectible and due, very few people have those type of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| There's a lot of people out here aren't paying these taxes, don't even know they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| And that's what we're trying to find, and find these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| And then they start paying like the other people are paying, and Knox County is better off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| and eventually we'll be more to the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| And if Kyle didn't make it clear, this is an ongoing tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| If we're in business five years, about the minimum is a $300 payment to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| We have very few $300 payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| And hopefully that you're going to hit on several big companies out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| that don't realize that the tax is doing payable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| I don't think they're avoiding them, but it's like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| If you get a bill in your mailbox, then you pay attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Can I ask you one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| So the terms of the contract, they're going to go through, what period of time are they going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| I mean, is it a time period or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Well, now purchase, or I think Hugh Hoche Group is somebody from, John, do you know on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| I was leaving some, one year, I was leaving that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| So it's however many they can find in a one-year time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:56| Moving to Resolution 910, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| requesting that the Chairman of the Knox County Commission establish a committee to review school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| and building construction efficiencies in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| and present recommendations to the Knox County Commission during a duly noticed public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| I received a call from Superintendent McIntyre, who I believe is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| I saw him during the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| And he said that the schools have already done this, that they have done an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| And so I was not aware that they had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| And so he had sent me the information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| So I'm wondering, do, I don't know if all the commissioners have gotten this information or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| If not, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I guess I'm looking at maybe postponing this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| Let's look at the information they've gotten because we don't need to recreate the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| If he has the information already that we're looking for, it will save everybody a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| So not knowing that information, I wanted to throw that out to see if that's a viable alternative for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| Receive this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| Let's look at it and maybe postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| Are you putting that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| I'll make that as a substitute motion that we postpone this for 30 days, look at the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| and if we feel we need more data, we can always come back and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Is 30 days enough, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| Good 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| After September 1st is what you're saying, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| We need to have plenty of time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| You've got to study these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| No, 30 is plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| Everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7006)|

| 1:56:50| We defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7015)|

| 1:57:25| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7052)|

| 1:58:10| 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Yeah, I'll just make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| You know, I think the $2,000 is arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| The Ethics Committee does need some financing so we can announce our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| I think we need to be good stewards of the money that the Commission entrusts us with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| and I hope that at the end of the year we can turn most of that back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| We are turning some funds back over from the end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| But I'll assure you we'll try to do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| It's not a large amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| but even with that I think we need to be good stewards of it and be certain that it's spent wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7132)|

| 2:00:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| What this does is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| It's not mandatory because a lot of people don't want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7227)|

| 2:00:33| No, this is not mandatory at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| And what this does is we've already passed a resolution allowing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| but the state passed a new law that said that they needed to get a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| and also a $20 permit fee, and this incorporates the state law in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| I thought you had this before us about a year ago when we passed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| and it wasn't mandatory, but I thought you might have been making it mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7252)|

| 2:03:01| I think the gentleman is here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| So, Mr. Edger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| Could you name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| 6609 East Emery Road, and I'm speaking about Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| and I apologize for not being here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| I thought the public forum would be a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| But first things first, I want to, if I didn't do this when you all appointed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| thanks to everyone that voted for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| I don't remember whether I did or not that that particular day I was so shocked that you actually appointed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:42| to the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| I wasn't ready for that, but I do thank you, and I've learned an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| The people of Carter Elementary School would like and are asking, as a matter of fact, at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:58| they actually pretty much demanded, I believe, a new elementary school for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| It has been now 70-plus years since they've had a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| The school has been renovated, and now they want to renovate and add on once again for $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:19| a million and a half of which will go to renovation of an existing gym that's there for the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:28| That leaves $3.5 million to build several different buildings, two stories as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:41| that would, and I'm not sure how much that would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| There's not been an estimate of those building projects that I haven't seen anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:52| And then other than that, I believe that the rest of the money is to be used for internal renovation of the older building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7492)|
| 2:05:03| but there has been no specifics as to what that renovation is going to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:10| There was no specifics that I remember that I've been told during a board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| or in other conversations with the superintendent or at the meeting that we had at the elementary school at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:27| It has the potential to, once again, to be a very beautiful building if it is, in fact, renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:34| but we prefer and are asking for you to either transfer enough money into that account to build a new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:45| or simply give us more money to do the renovation appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| And I think the commissioners from the District 8 will speak to that a little later on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7553)|
| 2:06:01| But I'm asking you to give the people of Carter Elementary and the community of Carter a new building that they can be very proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:12| and that they will be proud to send their students to, their children, free of any problems that it currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:24| And from what I understand at that meeting, there are some sewer problems that need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| that I was not aware of, but they were mentioned at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| And when I toured the elementary school, I noticed several things myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:42| Beautiful old wood that was painted over that needs to be totally stripped and renovated to, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| to be turned to its original luster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| Modification and renovation of the offices from upstairs at the back to downstairs where the new turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7614)|
| 2:07:01| and let off and pickup area will be, which is an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| And I think one other thing that needs to be done, the playground for the children is across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:15| The children have to physically walk across the street to get to their playground facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:23| And this, to me, produces a safety hazard that needs to be remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:30| And this safety hazard can be remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| There is property there that would allow for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| And it is already property that Knox County School owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| And so it would be a very simple process of designing the playground in an area that would be much safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:55| would not have to cross a thoroughfare, a public roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| even though the people tell you this roadway is not being used very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| and all it takes is one child to be hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| And we would all be very sad about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| But yet we would know in the back of our heads that we had an opportunity to do something about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:18| as well as build a new building, which is what I'm asking for, for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| Not for myself, because it wouldn't do me any good, but it will do that community some good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| And it will be the first new school that they've had for an elementary school since 1938, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| somewhere in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| And I believe one of the teachers there from the high school that, at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| put a very nice period on the whole meeting that we had when she asked her father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| her 82-year-old father, to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| And she pointed out the fact that that gentleman had been in the first grade at the original Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:07| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| Sir, I've got a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| And I'm very torn on this issue, and I've talked to a lot of folks about it this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| And one thing that has me so torn is the cost of renovating versus the cost of new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:30| And I think most people who watch these meetings know that I'm a strong advocate for tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:38| When we have an old building downtown that someone wants to restore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:45| I see, I recognize that it's going to cost more to restore that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| than it would be to tear it down and start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| And there are some of our buildings that are worth saving, our heritage that's worth holding on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| And so I generally vote for those TIFs, the tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| And I vote for those because I realize that there's not enough private money to restore these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| that you probably walked past today coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| With that said, here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| I don't know that that school can be restored for $5 million, I think, is what's in the budget for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| And one of my concerns is that it may actually be cheaper in the long run to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:36| I've not toured it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I'm going to rely a lot on, you know, the other folks that I've talked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| Do you yourself, do you believe that it would be more cost effective to restore this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:50| or do you think it would be more cost effective to build a new facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| Not being an engineer and not having an engineering degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7856)|
| 2:11:03| it would be difficult for me to answer that question other than from my own thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| And I tend to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| However, knowing that Knox County Schools has either used their own engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:19| or employed an engineer to check out the foundation and the structure itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| they tell me that the building and our foundation, I should say, is in excellent condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| Now, define excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| I take excellent to mean a top-notch A1 condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| And as we all know, buildings built back in that time period would probably meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:49| However, Carter Elementary suffers the same dilemma as I'm fighting for also, a new Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7909)|
| 2:12:00| There's two pots of land that were bought for that purpose, for both buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:08| Carter Elementary has a piece of land behind it and then within a mile down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| Why don't we use those lands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| Why don't we make use of the land down the road that I understand, having visited, is larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:27| will hold a nice elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| And then if we need to, renovate the old building for use by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| and by the other two schools that are there, Carter High School and Carter Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| and we all come out winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| And also it solves your playground issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| A lot of the problems that we have is, you know, I mean, I do not see, when I look at this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| this was a very difficult budget to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| I don't see any more money being available for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| And one thing that I'm concerned about, and I know there's a big move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| folks are asking us to not approve the capital plan today, to essentially send it back to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:17| and to Mr. McIntyre so that they can look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| And, you know, I mean, certainly I look at the calendar and I know my days in this chair are quite numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:30| And I do know that we're about to get a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| And one thing that I want people to realize, if I do vote to put this off today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| and if this commission does vote to send this back, we're about to elect a man to be mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:45| either the Democrat nominee or the Republican nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| We're not going to elect someone who's superhuman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| It's going to be a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| The numbers are not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| The county's budget are not going to change simply because we're getting a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| And what I don't want to do is I don't want to put this off and I don't want folks to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| I don't want to set the next administration up for people believing that they're going to be a miracle worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| Because if we don't approve this plan today and if ultimately the next smaller commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:21| and the next mayor's administration are in place when this decision is ultimately made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:29| these are still human beings, the numbers are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| and I just don't want to set folks up to think that the next mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| and the next commission are going to be able to perform miracles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| We're human beings and the money is the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| But the big thing that I'm really torn on is would we be better off to spend the $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| to build whatever school $5 million could build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| or would we be better off to go ahead and approve this capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| and let the school system do the renovations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| And I'm still torn on that and have no idea how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| But I just want to make sure folks realize if this ultimately is put off today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| the numbers aren't going to change in the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| and we're going to be right where we're at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| Yes, Mr. Lambert, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| However, I also agree that some numbers have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| They have changed in the west part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Now, that's not saying they shouldn't build a school there in the west part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| However, the economy in the last year and a half has changed markedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:40| If my information is correct, there are two subdivisions down in that area that sit totally empty today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8140)|
| 2:15:49| And they're likely to be empty in the next three to four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| unless the economy somehow magically improves tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| So that $18.5 million to build a new school in that area for 500 projected students is very questionable in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:09| Now, again, I'm not an economist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| I'm an educator as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| But I believe I can see that there is a problem with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| And I believe that there are cheaper ways to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| I look at surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| And, you know, I just, you know, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| And I really hesitate to talk about schools because I'm single.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| I don't have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| And I don't want to be the single guy saying we need to cheapen our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| But the truth is I think that we could build schools just something as small as not putting a closet in every classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:49| and putting more cabinets and shelving in would save a tremendous amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| Maybe if we built our interior walls, and I know they need to be soundproofed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| but if we use soundproofing insulation and traditional sheetrock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| that we could still get the soundproofing between the classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| and we could save on the amount of cinder block construction that we needed on the interior walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:12| I know that new technology is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| Libraries are going to be obsolete in a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| With an electronic book, now an e-book, retails for around $150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| And most book, 90% of the books that are in a library are books that are out of copyright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| Well, if a book is out of copyright, it's absolutely free through the Gutenberg Project online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| to be downloaded in an e-book format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| I know there's technology on the horizon that's going to make it cheaper to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:46| And I know there's things that we could do to where maybe we could take part of the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| that's allocated to the Westmont Knoxville School, add it to that $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| and there may be a way to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| But ultimately, and it goes back to a lawsuit, this commission and the next commission has little say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:05| It's you and your colleagues on the school board that tend to have more say in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| But I do believe that there are ways to cut costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| But I just want to be sure that I just don't want to set the next administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| and the next commission up to be looked at as miracle workers because they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| They're humans just like the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| We're all human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| We all have the same frailties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| However, I do disagree with you on the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| I think libraries will always be very useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| The form is going to change, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| Paper products, I think, will always be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| The problem with technology is not so much that it's the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| It's the money issue, as with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| We have to have computers for every single student, which is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| We have to have Internet connections for every single student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| and that requires you to either use some form of Wi-Fi or some sort of wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:12| Then if we allow them to take them home, then what do we do there if a student somehow tears up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:20| either through malice or not, or they lose it, stolen, whatever, what do we do with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:29| particularly if the parents are not capable of paying for the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| but yet we're still going to have to provide them with a second computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| because this is the way they're receiving their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| But I agree that somehow or another we need to quit paying $100 for a textbook that weighs 20 pounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:56| and we're carrying it from A to B, day in and day out, and get it on a CD or online, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:08| and so our kids can be learning the greatest and best information about our world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| and our local community that's at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| But as we all know, it's going to cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| Education is not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| Running a business is not cheap, no matter what kind of business it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| whether it's my business, your business, county's business, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| Money is beginning to play a much more major factor than it did, say, five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:45| I mean, after all, the federal government broke and so are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| But when we look at the amount of money that we owe in capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| Yes, a question for you piqued my interest when you made this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| You said you're asking us for a new school or enough funds to renovate Carter appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:09| How much money, in your view, would it take to renovate Carter Elementary appropriately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| Well, again, I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| I have what I think is a feasible guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| However, I have a remedy that probably is not very popular with a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:28| that if you were to, say, give us another $5 million, that would be a total of $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:37| And then at the end of the project, if there was any money left over, it would be returned to the coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:44| Which to me, now that may be a little bit of a pie in the sky in my way of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:54| but I learned from not only my parents but also a very good principal years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| that when I did some work within the school that benefited the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| I would go and ask for X amount of dollars and he'd usually give me 50% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| And at the end of the project, I returned whatever I had left after doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| And to me, you don't just keep spending just because you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:25| You return whatever you don't need after you've looked at all the A's, B's, C's, all the way to Z's of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:36| And right now, and also one other thing I failed to mention is that from this same principal and from my parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| I learned that when you start a project, you pretty much have all your A's and Z's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:50| You know exactly what you're going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| And if you don't, then how can you give an estimate of what this project is going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| And this is another problem that I have with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| I don't think that we know all of everything that's in the middle from A to Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:13| I think we know where we want to begin and where we start, but we don't know everything in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| Of course, with construction, as we all know, that there's going to be things that come up from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:27| that in old construction, when we start demolishing walls and looking at what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:34| we'll find things that we had no way of knowing that they were there or not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| that may need to be updated and brought up to modern standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| But I was going to say it would seem to me, though, that if let's say that we were to do the $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| we're getting very close to the cost of a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| And so at that point, it would just seem to me that if we were to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| and I'm not saying we are, but if we were, then we're getting very close to a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| And I don't know that I personally would be willing to go for $10 million to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| when you're looking at you could build a new school for probably just a couple more million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| But anyway, I appreciate your comments and thank you so much for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| You know, we have schools older than that in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| A lot older, matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| One problem I have is we've bought property in South Knoxville to build an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| And I've just talked to Dr. McIntyre here about he had nothing to do with this at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| I fought the school system with buying property and holding it for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| Apparently, they didn't need the school there when they bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| Times change with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| But we don't have the money right now to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| Now, $5 million, I think, would do a lot of renovation, an awful lot of renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| But I'd like for everybody to have new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| But what we're causing right here, whether you don't realize it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| I need schools in my district or renovations in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| The second, third, all of them need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| We're setting a precedent here that does not need to be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| This is not the way government is supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| I'll vote for this if you'll do this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| That's what's going on in Morrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| That's why we're this way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| I don't like blackmail tactics, and that's what this appears to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| We have to take the school board at their word, and I realize you're a member of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| They know what they're doing and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| Now, you have to spend this money where it's needed worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| If we need schools in West Knoxville, it's outvoted for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| Because that's where the growth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| That's where the population is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| East and South Knoxville have brought a lot of these problems on theirself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| We haven't allowed growth into that community, so we don't get things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| And the reason why we don't get things is the people aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| The need's not there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| Now, if they build a new school down west, the reason they're building it is because they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| They don't have one down there to remodel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| All those are full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| We've got to put our priorities in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| And what I'm saying is if anybody doesn't like what the school board's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| or the superintendent sitting on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| they should run for school board and try to change things to protect their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Now, that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| But what we're doing here now, if they give it to East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| I'm going to be back next month hollering for one for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| And we don't even have the money hardly to renovate this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| But I'm just telling you, I'm coming back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| If they're going to build one in East Knox County, Carter, I want one built in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| because our schools are as bad off and older than that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| And where's it going to stop at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| We've got to depend on the school board and the people to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| And that's where my vote will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:07| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| I've been reminded I am speaking on my own personal behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:21| Mr. Chairman, I just feel compelled to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| Mr. Richmond, we appreciate that he's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| We appreciate his personal opinion on where we are with the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| But I do remind the commissioners that the request on behalf of the board collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| is before you in an item in your agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| And the request is the capital improvement plan that has been duly agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| and approved by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| So Mr. Richmond's request for doing something different in terms of your action this evening is his request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:54| and his opinion as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| It does not reflect the collective will of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| So I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| And my work address is 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| Glad to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| As Dr. McIntyre has just pointed out, there is something before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:32| This resolution 801 is the Knox County capital plan presented to county commission by the Knox County mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8912)|
| 2:28:46| And my question sort of relates to the interpretation of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| or not this is an up or down vote on this entire capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| or whether it's available at our discretion to give comment to certain paragraphs, articles, lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8937)|
| 2:29:07| within the county mayor's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| So I guess I'm asking the law director if we, county commission, have the discretion to cut or carve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8953)|
| 2:29:22| or take various actions on various portions of the county capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:32| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Interestingly, as important as this issue is, this precious little case law, in fact, there's almost none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| no statutory authority or guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| Bottom line is you're empowered to craft it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| You're empowered to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| You can certainly carve out certain portions of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| You've got pretty broad discretion in your plan because, again, it is an aspirational plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| in terms of the county's portion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| And you can likewise discuss that what you're going to a lot to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| But once it does go to schools, then your power and authority ends in terms of how that money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9000)|
| 2:30:13| Then as we continue to discuss the capital plan, the only thing that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:22| and it's not really a disagreement with the capital plan, it's a question of the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| As I stated at the last meeting of commission, I paused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:34| I had uneasiness whenever I read off of the computer disc as given to us by the county mayor about the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:47| And the one part of the Carter renovation that caused my most uneasiness is the word possible construction of four new classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9047)|
| 2:31:01| The word possible being in front of the word four new classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| This is not a discussion that I'm having with anyone except those commissioners seated here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:16| I have been able to talk to my wife about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9076)|
| 2:31:23| She's glad I'm here today, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| At least it's letting her rest from the question that I've asked that started the things as they are now in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9086)|
| 2:31:34| I asked at the last commission meeting that we pause for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| Since the capital plan was drawn up or looked at by the school board in February, brought to us last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:48| I would like to have commission be at Carter Elementary School, see the place, get an opinion of whether or not what's taking place is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9108)|
| 2:32:02| And I truly appreciate Chairman Strickland making that arrangement and for his attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| Also, Vice Chairman Greg Leuthold was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| Commissioner Saunders, Schaust, Smith, Brown, Norman, Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9135)|
| 2:32:25| Commissioner Hammond attended the second meeting and I attended both meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| Commissioner Armstrong attended both meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| The only reason I'm laboring at what has taken place among the commissioners is that it's been two hours of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9154)|
| 2:32:42| two-hour meeting, a two-hour meeting for the majority of those people, and then one other two-hour meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9162)|
| 2:32:52| That's all the time that we as a commission have had time to discuss what might be taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| So then I need to wander off a little bit and talk to the commissioners that have not attended the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:03| but have looked at the appropriate documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| What is it that we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:10| What is happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| A lot of the stuff that Commissioner Wright is saying, you know, I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:26| But we voted earlier to postpone this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| We're only in public forum right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| And I don't think we can properly discuss this as a commission until we get into that item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| and have a motion, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| That would be the preferred methodology, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| I think you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| I don't want to rain on your parade day, but you're going to have to say it again after a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| Save your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| 801 is the last thing that we have for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9236)|
| 2:34:03| He asked for it to be at the end after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| Are we going to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| I didn't get any objections, so I guess we're adjourned until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9248)|
| 2:34:19| Do we have some objections to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| Adjourning or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| Adjourned until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9263)|
| 2:34:39| Superintendent of Schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9279)|
| 2:34:53| I believe at the time that the capital budget was originally contemplated by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| I think there was some question as to whether that would be something that would absolutely happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| or something that would possibly happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| I think at this point in time it is our intent to move forward with those four classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| So that would be part of the project as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| And I have a whole lot more to say on the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| The capital budget doesn't just talk about Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| It talks about a whole lot of other very important building projects across our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| So I would welcome the opportunity to speak to the commission about the broader capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| improvement plan that the Board has adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| and also to talk about certainly the capital project at the Carter Campus when the time is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| and when the chairman determines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| I just want to make that clear and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Well, not to be a, I told you so, stick in the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| There's nothing says we can't ask Dr. McIntyre to do that now to present that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9353)|
| 2:36:01| And we can make a motion to have him present that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| but we can't discuss that item until it comes to its point on the agenda at this point since we've set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| So if somebody wants to make a motion to have him present his capital plan now, that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| Am I correct, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| I need to get the law director to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| I mean, yes, sir, that's the, essentially, in order to maintain the quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| that's what the policy you've adopted and that's the manner in which you normally proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:39| So what's the pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9399)|
| 2:36:44| Recess till six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| Mr. Chairman, do we have any people out here that are from the Carter community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9408)|
| 2:36:54| I know a group right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| I mean, you know, those of you that are here, you realize you may be waiting another three hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9417)|
| 2:37:05| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| I just would like to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| We spend so much time here and we've got an hour and a half almost of dead time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| So I would, you know, I think we ought to reconsider most all the parties are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| There may be a few people from Carter that are not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| but I'm sure these people can represent the Carter community pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| So anyway, that's my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| And if I might comment, if this was public forum that we were just in, then this is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:50| I would appreciate Dr. McIntyre relaying whatever thoughts he might have to us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9470)|
| 2:38:00| If this is still public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| But there's a motion on the floor at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| And the motion on the floor is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| To consider this as, you know, to change our agenda and move this now to be heard now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9488)|
| 2:38:18| I didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| You're talking about item 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| Move it up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9504)|
| 2:38:25| We've got time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:26| Consider it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| And there was a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:34| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| I thought we voted to put this just right after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| Give us that agenda again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| I'm asking to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| I was on the prevailing side, I guess, of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9534)|
| 2:38:57| I consented to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| So I'm asking to reconsider that item to be moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| Now, Director Jarrett, we have a motion to reconsider moving the 801 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:13| Commissioners, you changed that time during the beginning of your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| So it's not as if this was something that was scheduled and the public will be deprived of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9556)|
| 2:39:23| I don't see where anybody's due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| This is really a commission should accept input again by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| You'll ultimately pass a capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| I don't see any issue relative to depriving anyone of due process if you want to proceed with this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:41| But I think it does require a commission vote because you did set your agenda earlier in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| And, again, you can certainly move, if you believe it's in the public's interest, to move forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9587)|
| 2:39:53| Would that take a simple majority or a two-thirds vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9593)|
| 2:40:00| I would say that would take a simple majority because you use a simple majority just to set your agenda this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:09| Well, not simple, but it would take ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| Correct. It will take ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| Commissioner Burroughs, you have something on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| Commissioners Wright and Armstrong, I'm assuming that you asked for this to come after zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:23| so that you could give people a firm time of when they needed to be here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| So you're expecting more people from the Carter community to be here at 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:34| because that was when you instructed them that they would have a chance to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| Okay. I feel very uncomfortable about changing the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| when those constituents have been asked to come at a particular time to be here to give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:51| So I would not be in favor of moving this back because I don't believe that that is treating those people fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:58| I also want to point out that some of you get really cranky when your blood sugar drops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| and this is an opportunity for you to go have some dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| Commissioner Maluto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to echo what Commissioner Burroughs just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:14| If the public was told to basically be here sometime 6 or a little after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| then the commissioners from that district told them that, and we agreed to that up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:27| I think we need to stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| I would be voting against the motion on that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| I want to echo what Commissioner Burroughs and Commissioner Leuthold said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| I believe it is in the public interest for us to do this at the time we said we were going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:45| It is in our best interest to do it now as a commission because we do have some downtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| I understand that and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| But I do not believe it is in the public interest for us to consider it now when we know we have people coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:57| People are under the impression, if they saw this earlier, that it was going to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| If we change the time, I just don't believe that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| And Commissioner Burroughs also mentioned about food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| I would also remind our colleagues that happy hours started at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| It's 5 o'clock somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| If members from the 8th District were, in fact, informed that there was a time certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| then that clearly is distinguishing consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:24| Because, again, you don't want to deprive citizens of their due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| And if people were told during a public forum or any other meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| obviously that gives them license to later feel that they were not treated justly and fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:37| Yes, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| Yes, I just want to say, and nobody debates more fiercely with Mr. Norman than I do, but I want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9758)|
| 2:42:46| I don't believe that his motion was in any way self-serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| I think that maybe he hadn't considered that folks had been told this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:56| And I just want to reiterate that I think that he was looking at the best interest of the public when he made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9776)|
| 2:43:05| But I want to ask him now, Tony, would you like to withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part1?start=9785)|
