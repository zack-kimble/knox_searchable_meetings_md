| 0:00:30| Well, let me call this workshop to order, and I will ask Councilman Marshall Stair to give us the pledge or lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=30)|
| 0:00:42| Please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=45)|
| 0:01:01| Thank you. Now, Mr. Johnson, if you will call the roll please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| Councilman Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Councilwoman McKenzie. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Councilwoman Ryder. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| Councilman Roberto. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| Councilman Singh-Perez. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| Councilman Stair. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| Councilwoman Welch. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| Thank you very much. I've said it just a moment ago, but I'll repeat myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| The agenda tonight is fairly simple. Unfortunately, we can't display it on the screen for some technical reason I don't understand, but it's broken down into three or four parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=86)|
| 0:01:38| I will ask Director Green to give us a community overview and the outreach efforts that have occurred to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| And then we will talk about three different districts in the proposal, the commercial districts, the office districts, and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=106)|
| 0:01:56| And I have asked a few moments ago, if you want to speak on any one of those, you need to sign up with Mr. Johnson, and I think everybody has done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=116)|
| 0:02:05| And then, finally, Council, of course, during each one of those, will have a chance to speak with and have a conversation with Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=125)|
| 0:02:14| And then we will ask the audience, those that have signed up, if they would like to make some comments about one or two or three of those specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| And then, of course, at the end, we will have an open forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| So, now, having said that, Director Green, if you would like to start us out with the community outreach and overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=146)|
| 0:02:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| First, I'd like to say that, just as background, one of our most challenging things with the update of the zoning code is it represents change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| It represents change in the way things have developed in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| It represents that the city of Knoxville is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| How do we address that change, and do we address it is a big question that underlies this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| If we don't address it, we continue doing things the way we have been doing them for the past 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| Is that appropriate as we enter the second quarter of the 21st century?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| That's a decision you have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| A lot of the people we've heard from have concerns that are rooted in change, and that's certainly understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| Change is scary to us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| The change of moving to Knoxville scared me to no end, but it turned out to be a great thing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| What we have to do is address the changing development patterns, the changing desires of people who want to live, work, and play and live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=207)|
| 0:03:39| How do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| We've had the input of some national consultants who have worked throughout the United States on zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| We've had the input of great staff from the city of Knoxville, great staff from the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| and most importantly, great comments from the community to help us get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| Those have helped us to loathe a vision that may not meet everyone's expectations, but it serves, I believe, Knoxville well for the future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=237)|
| 0:04:09| We also have tools that may be used sparingly now, but put us in a position to have something to use as the city continues to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=249)|
| 0:04:19| With that, I'll get into the first slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Are you now moving on to the districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Here's the agenda, and I'll tell you what we're going to do, and then I'll get into the community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| First, I'm rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| If you have a question at any point, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| But first, just an update on the outreach that the Knoxville-Knox County Planning staff have done to get the word out to the community about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=282)|
| 0:04:51| We'll do an overview of the goals of the proposed office, commercial and industrial districts, an overview of the office districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| and I believe Vice Mayor Saunders has said after each category of non-residential districts, we'll have an opportunity for questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=297)|
| 0:05:07| Then we'll go to an overview of the commercial districts, the commercial district standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| breaking them down into what I'll call our general commercial districts and then our downtown districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| overview of the industrial districts, and then there are some policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| And I sent that short paper identifying the policy issues and providing an overview of them to you earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| and I believe Mr. Johnson has provided copies of that paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| Those are issues on which your input and direction is really needed as we move into the final phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| what I hope is the final phase of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Then we'll just general discussion and questions and talk about the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| In regard to community outreach, this project has been going on almost two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| and during that time, the planning staff, with the assistance of the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Knoxville Area Chamber of Commerce, and the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| and just interested community members have done this amount of outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Some key numbers here are that we've had 20 newsletters, 55 articles and media coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| over 80 community public meetings, almost 67,000 website visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| On our three rounds of public outreach, we have amassed a total of, I can't total this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| but as you see, we start with 756 on the technical report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Our high point was draft two and map one with 1,421 points of contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| and we've tapered down with the latest round with 371.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Overall written comments submitted to date are on the map comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| We've had 777 and 603 general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| So we've had a lot of community input, and I appreciate the diligence of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| in providing those comments and providing direction for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| The goals of our proposed non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| and these flow from some of the policy directives and city plans, city policy statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| the goals of the overall city, and these goals are to create standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| that will encourage redevelopment of our former industrial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| acknowledge and address 21st century development trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| provide the ability to revitalize our older commercial centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| encourage investments in our corridors while protecting the character of those corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and the adjacent neighborhoods, acknowledge that Knoxville is an urban center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| and needs to grow in an urban manner, create a hierarchy of districts that scale up in intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| and recognize that Knoxville is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| With our office districts, we have two office-type districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| The first is just the basic office district, which is a low-intensity office area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| that can accommodate residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| It's often used as a transition between single-family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and other residential areas and more intense commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Retail uses and eating and drinking establishments are not permitted within the office district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| recognizing its role as a transition district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| and also there are some basic building size standards unless some design standards are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| And this is a policy issue that we'll talk about later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| and I'll give you more details when we get into the standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| The office park district is built to accommodate those large office developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| and, as it states, office parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| It's oriented towards larger-scale employment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| The district standards are intended to guide development in a more campus-like setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| and retail uses in this district are secondary to the primary office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| The office district standards, again, the minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| The minimum lot width is 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Again, small lots allowing for small-scale development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Setbacks are 15 feet in the front and side and 20 feet in the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| unless it's abutting a residential district, then it's 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| The maximum height is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Again, to be in scale with what is often the adjacent residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| There's a maximum gross floor area of 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| unless certain design standards are met, and these are basic design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| They're not high level, and we'll go into those in just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| The office park has a larger minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet, almost half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| The minimum lot width is 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| The setbacks are a bit more, 25 feet front, 20 at the rear and side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| unless it's abutting a residential district, then it's 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| And the maximum height is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| Gerald, are you going to go into more detail about this when we get to the specific sections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| Not much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Well, then why don't we pause just a minute before you go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| And I know Councilman Roberto wants to make a few general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Well, first off, Gerald, I think you've done a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Obviously you've gone through and talked about all of the ways we've had public outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| and so I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| I think everyone involved here today wants to continue to maintain this as a transparent process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| and this council has discussed the need for notice regarding recode previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| It's my understanding that the notice standard required by law has been followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| but I think in this case we should do more than what's required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| I would therefore recommend that notice regarding recode be added to property tax mailings going out to all property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| This notice can also advise property owners who would request a change back to a previously comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| that the Planning Commission has offered to do free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| This is one point that I think we've all had some discussion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| and before we get too deep into the discussion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| I wanted to see what council thought about this as a proposal to help with this notice issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| Are there any comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| Yeah. Thanks, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Just for clarification, I like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| So would this be notice to every property owner in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| and would it tell them how they're zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| or is it just check this website to find out how you're zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| What's the sort of idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| So I think one thing we'll need to do is work in collaboration with the administration on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| but the idea would be that all property owners receive a property tax notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| so without any burden on the taxpayers, we can put a piece of paper in there and mail that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| I think having information about what recode has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| and that they may contact the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| and there's an opportunity for review, and like the director said, it would be at no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=755)|
| 0:12:44| But I think it addresses something that we've all, I think, struggled with a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| and I think in a way that doesn't really burden the taxpayers but does provide notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| How does it not burden the taxpayer, Andrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| when the tax notices don't go out until later in the year, like October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Are you suggesting we wait that long to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| I think my preference would be to do it sooner than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| but I don't think that that's probably likely to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| in the sense that if we did a mailing like a postcard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| then we'd have, obviously, these mailings go out anyway, so postage is already taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| So that's what I mean by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| So the mailings don't happen until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| So you're talking about we'd wait until a vote on recode until that's gone out in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| No, I'm not proposing that because I don't think that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| I think that would be contrary to what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Gerald, you and I met about this a couple weeks ago after we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| after I brought it up at council and we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Let's go back to that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Let's talk about the logistics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| A mail and a postcard to every 70,000 property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| at a cost of the card and the postage at somewhere around 50 cents a card plus...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| The staff time involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| It's really the staff time involved in those phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| because you have some numbers and percentages of responses you get from a typical sector mailing or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| What I did was estimate that there would be 50,000 unique property owners figuring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=863)|
| 0:14:33| That's just a guesstimate accommodating those who have multiple properties, 50,000 property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| If 5% of those called us, that's 2,500 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| We typically spend 30 minutes on a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| I've forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| That's close to a year, one staff person's full time for a year to deal with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| That's the burden that we have that we would look for how to fund that staff person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| Then we wait until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Do we extend that year period to next October 2020 for reevaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| There's some logistical problems and cost problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| How do we fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Even though we'll do it for no fee, we still have the cost of advertising, staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Those are things I have to work through when people come through for rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Even though it's not a burden to the taxpayer, maybe in part of the notice there will be drafting the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| how do we deal with the follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| We have to be, I think, be aware of the cost involved and know that there is a cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| and there will be a cost that will have to be paid somehow for the staff time, the implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| I follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| I have no issue with the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| It's just being aware of what results from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| State law doesn't require us to do a property mailing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| It seemed to be impractical to do a mailing and on top of take the hours that it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| You say a lot of these calls, it simply will explain to me what my zoning is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| and what I'm entitled to do versus what I would be entitled to do in the future with the zoning that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| That conversation could easily go into 30 minutes, you said, and some of it's just an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| It's just simply they got a one-on-one consultation about their property and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| The other proposal was to do large ads, if you will, half-page ads in the paper to make that notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1004)|
| 0:16:54| One ran this past Sunday in the Sentinel, in the A section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| identifying this meeting tonight that people could come and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| One of the other things you talked about was that you were establishing a policy at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| that says no fees to review your rezoning within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| You said that you were willing to not only make that your policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| but you'd put it in the recode as part of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| so that it would supersede anybody's office policy, but it would actually be part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| That there be no fees associated with a rezoning to come in up to one year and reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Now, that is subject to five votes on council, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I mean, it's just subject to regular rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| But that would give them an opportunity for a year to come back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| So I think after we talked about it at length, I mean, Charles Swanson was at that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| We talked about it would require a budget amendment to put forth a budget amendment to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| and he says I've got to be paid for that one year's worth of time or up to one year's worth of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| And we estimated that to be close to $100,000, which it is a taxpayer's dollars at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1083)|
| 0:18:13| So I think the ads, while not perfect, I think we do exceed what state law requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1093)|
| 0:18:24| and what our own ordinance requires that we passed just a few, even a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| So I think it's enough, and given the amount of public input we've already had and will yet to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| then I think people are being notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| So I'm not in favor of doing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| I support what we're trying to do, which is above and beyond what we're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| And we've got a lot more meetings to publicize, to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| I think that's an update on that from my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| Mr. Green, Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Just Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| You want to go, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| I feel strange being called Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| People do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| What was the budget like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Because it predated many of us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| What was the budget like for this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| How was it spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Where are we at in that figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| I can answer most of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| The budget for the project was $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Of that, $289,000, I believe, was for the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| The $11,000 was for the planning, Knoxville-Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| To this point, we've done all the public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| We've done all the mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| We have spent probably in excess, if I tried to calculate the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| in excess of $200,000 of staff time on this project, counting my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| the other primary staff involved, our mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| our communications people on the outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| We spent $30,000 from our fund balance to a contract with SEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Central Hispano in the Knoxville area, Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| to outreach to parts of the sectors of the community that are typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| underrepresented in public processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| At least $200,000 of our staff time has been allocated to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| possibly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| In addition to the $289,000 to the Cameros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| You also mentioned at previous meetings, maybe stakeholder meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| that a notice went out in KUB Connections, which I didn't agree with as fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| I'm glad that you did it, just because I don't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Two KUB buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| We realize that no one method reaches everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| There was no fee for that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| It was a community announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Community announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| No fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| No fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Just our time and crafting the wording and making sure it met their parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| So ballpark on marketing, it was just the newspaper ads, public meeting ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| It was doing a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Money on all of these that were printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| And I didn't include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| The city paid for most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| The city, rather than Knoxville, Knox County Planning, paid for most of the printing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| and we greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Whatever the price is, if he's here, he approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| But we're also doing surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| We did a survey, actually two community surveys, one in Spanish, one in English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| Again, the websites, the e-mail list, we have an e-mail list, social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1300)|
| 0:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| So over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| We have articles and media coverage often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| We contacted media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Some follow us more closely than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Others contact media and provide them information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| So is it fair to say it's over the original budget as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| We didn't anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| To be honest, we or I did not anticipate the amount of staff time that would go into this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| I was optimistic that the consultant would do more, would carry a lot of the load,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| but they wrote the basic text, and I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I'm not speaking on behalf of Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| who coordinated the city involvement in this and how much time they've spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| but I know just from my work with Peter and with staff of the city law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| that there's a lot of city staff time involved also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Councilman Caput.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Well, I think the outreach effort's been good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| but I still have to agree with my fellow councilmembers here about direct notice somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| I don't care if it's social media, phone calls, e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| but if someone's property rights are being diminished in their development rights to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| then they have to be directly contacted, I feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| especially at the very least property owners that live out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| And what about those whose property rights and development rights are increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Because in many cases we're going from a plan commercial where you have to present a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| and be subject to planning commission approval to just staff approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| The height has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| The intensity of development has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| So do we pare down those and look at who make a subjective evaluation of who's diminished and who's increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| Well, I think in general if someone's property rights are being improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| their development potential is improved or changing for the better, then that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| But if it's being downgraded, then I think they at least should be notified somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| I mean not everybody reads the paper, which is declining in viewership anyway, the physical paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| But, I mean, again, I think property rights need to be recognized when these changes are being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| And, again, I mean at the bare minimum if you live out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| and I don't know how many thousands of people in property in Knoxville that live out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| but they need a direct mailer to say, hey, this is what's happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| I don't know if you have property managers that are managing your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| but this is what's going down and you need to be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| So I don't know how we acquire that change, but it should happen I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| I completely agree with what Councilmember Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| We have the notice requirement that's required under the law has been followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| There's been more that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| It has been done with the ads in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| but I think the reason I was bringing this up is what Councilman Campin was saying too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| You know, we can provide, we can do more than what we're required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| and in this particular plan we do it in a way that does not, you know, we're sending the mailing out anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| So why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Why not do more than we're required to under the law there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| That information can also tell folks at whatever time this passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| that they have the ability to go and talk to the director about their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| and it will be free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| And it won't be free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| You pay me and I would assign another staff person there to do that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| so the funds would be used more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| I'm not saying that they're going to talk to you necessarily directly, but to the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| I just feel like this is something that we can do to go above and beyond what we're required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| which we're already doing, but this is a way of making sure, like Councilman Campin said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| that every property owner is at least touched once by a notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| Apparently Ms. Malone wants to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Would Council be comfortable allowing Ms. Malone to make some comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| There's a difference between, and this is the problem I have with Councilman Roberto's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| there's a difference between notice and reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| If you wait until November or October, you're reporting what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| You're not giving notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Your property is being given more property rights or fewer, upzoning or downzoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1586)|
| 0:26:35| and I think all should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| The other thing I would say is this is a big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| You've said it's going to take, you know, it's a 40-, 50-year project, and yes, it's expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| and no, it shouldn't wait, but I think postcard notices, even if there are a lot of phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| need to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| The idea that MPC will somehow then come back if there are complaints after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| MPC will somehow come back and you all can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Okay, say my property remains the same, but the property next door goes from residential to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| even though the one-year plan, the sector plan all say it should be residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| but it's changed to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| I went and talked to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| I don't think you guys or Mr. Green are going to say to the next-door property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| your property ought to go back to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| I just don't think that's going to happen, and if that property owner has gotten a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| he has the right to that zoning, which would be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| My property zoning protects my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| My neighbor's property zoning protects me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| So, you know, I think we're all in it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| It's one thing to meet the minimum standards of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| It's something else to do what is expectation by elected officials in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| when they are elected in response to their constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| and I think they expect transparency as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| This is a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| When we've done general rezonings, we've notified every property owner in advance, not after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| and, yes, it's tedious and you get the calls as a council member, as an MPC employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| but that is the name of the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Respond to the property owners before it happens, not after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you. Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| So I'd say, Andrew, you've got to bring a resolution and you've got to bring a budget amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| Bring it to council. Let's do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| If you're going to do that, do it now, not at the end, and not as Ms. Malone recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| I mean, you've got to do it in advance of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I mean, if you're going to do it in October to save the money, then we're going to end up postponing this vote until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| So if you want to do it and do it prior to the vote, then bring a resolution and a budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| and let's put it on the agenda on Tuesday night and let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Put a number to it and put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| It needs to happen now, not later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| I mean, otherwise, while we're going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| I think if you feel strongly about it, then let's vote it and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| Okay. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Can I just ask one question for those who were here before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| And I expressed this at the stakeholders meeting that some of us were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| Did this not get discussed to this level when you guys were passing the budget in preparation for recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| Anybody have a recollection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| We've been talking about notification all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| So we've been talking about it, but there's been no figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Until right now, there's been no dialogue about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| and nobody's brought forth a resolution and a budget amendment to go with it to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| And that's really the next step, if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| I just didn't know if it was a conversation that had died somewhere or not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| And, in fact, as Councilman Wallace indicated and as Director Green also indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| we've gone way beyond what is absolutely required of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| No, we have not done a mailing, but we've done a lot of things just short of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| And if you noticed the paper last Sunday, this meeting was advertised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| and the next one on February the 20th will also be advertised the Sunday before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| So, Councilman Stier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Green, do you have an estimate of how many parcels do you think are downzoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| or their development rights are restricted in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Again, defining that is so subjective that even I, with 30 years of experience in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| would not try to determine whether something is downzoned or upzoned or stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| We have a comparable zoning chart, but I have no idea in the time it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| My fear is I'm doing that subjectively and trying to notify part of the population as a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| We're saying 25,000 properties are downzoned, and one of those other 50,000 say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| I think I was downzoned and you didn't notify me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| So if we notify property owners, we need to notify everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| We shouldn't take some subjective measure and say, based on this assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| we're only notifying this number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| If we notify one, we should notify everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And I've gone through this wholesale zoning updates and zoning map changes this fourth time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1903)|
| 0:31:53| and it would be the first time there's been wholesale notification of every property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| And we've had at one meeting, I believe a stakeholder meeting or maybe a community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| the issue came up and a planner who had worked in several communities and gone through the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| was not aware of any instance where every property owner was notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| So it would be tilling new ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| Right. I guess when we originally thought of this, I just didn't think there would be significant downzoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| so that's why the notification issue didn't come up, at least in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| I mean, I knew that things setbacks and there would be changes to every zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| but in terms of what I consider sort of a downzoning, I didn't foresee that occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1955)|
| 0:32:44| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders and Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I would be of the opinion that if we're going to send a notice, that we send a notice to all property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Of course, there could be property owners, and there are property owners that live out of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| that may not be closely engaged or connected to this process that would need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| if it is going to be a zone up for them, that there is development potential for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| and they need to go to the website or contact the office to find out more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| There are a lot of people out there that are very computer savvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| So I think if you have that communication, Mr. Green, that they can reference the website as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| And I'm sure there will be some additional updates to it as we move through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| especially after the approval, that could mitigate some of the direct contact to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| I know that that is an additional cost, but it's an additional cost that would be well worth it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| to be able to ensure that all of our residents and property owners are aware of their rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| their property rights and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you, Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| If there are no further comments about that, I think there is a general agreement that if we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| we have to notify everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| We can't just pick a part out, and that would be the fair way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Let's move on then to the – and Director Green, you've already started this –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| the commercial districts, the purposes and standards, and then we'll discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| We'll come back to issues and concerns at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Commercial districts, again, we adhere to that goal of creating a hierarchy of zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| that scale up in intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We start with the neighborhood commercial, the small-scale and service areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| allowing residential uses also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| All our commercial districts allow residential uses at various densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| typically unlimited density in the commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| These are crafted to predominantly serve the adjacent residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| There's a 40% reduction in off-street parking permitted in the neighborhood commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| Taking into consideration the number of the patrons of the businesses in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| would likely have the opportunity to walk because of the placement of these districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| in and adjacent to residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| The general commercial district provides for a mix of retail service office and residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| along corridors and at nodes that were identified early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| It promotes mixed-use development in a pedestrian-oriented environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| and here a 20% reduction in off-street parking is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| The highway commercial, and one of the differences, and we're still clarifying this in the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| the general commercial does not allow outdoor storage of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| The highway commercial would allow outdoor storage and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Highway commercial accommodates those higher-intensity auto-oriented areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| It permits more intensive commercial uses, again, with permanent outdoor storage and service areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| Regional commercial is for medium- to large-scale development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| that serves both the regional and a local market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| and these developments typically generate significant traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Think of Turkey Creek or West Hill Mall as examples of regional commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| As a special district, the downtown Knoxville district is designed to encourage the mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| that is present in downtown with standards that would enhance the existing character of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| There are several sub-districts within the downtown district, the downtown boulevard, the downtown warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| downtown historic, and the downtown lineage districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| The forum districts, the South Waterfront and Cumberland Avenue forum districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| have been brought over wholesale into a section of the zoning ordinance titled forum districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| and they foster a high-quality public realm by prescribing the form of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| and other elements within the development area and zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and they address through their forum code standards the relationship between building facades and the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| They deal a lot more with design standards than any of our other zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| Their district standards, again, the commercial neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| our neighborhood commercial district is designed for the small scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| There's no minimum lot area or setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| There are minimal setbacks with greater setbacks when they're residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Maximum building height of 35 feet meant to be in scale with the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| Maximum gross floor area, and this has actually changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| It's now 10,000 square feet unless certain design standards are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| and those are pretty basic design standards, and we'll get into those in just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| The general commercial district has no minimum lot area width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| There are no setbacks when they're adjacent to other commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| It's 20 to 25 feet when inviting residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| There is a build-to zone in the CG2 and the CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| The build-to zone means a building has to set within 50 percent of the building width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| and our frontage in a CG2 has to be within that build-to zone in a CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| Seventy percent of the building width has to be in the build-to zone of 0 to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| The maximum building height is 40 feet in CG1, 70 feet in CG2, and unlimited in CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| There is a provision that the building has to scale down when adjacent to residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| There's a maximum of 45 foot height at the building setback line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| and then for every additional foot and setback, the building height can increase two feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| and there are basic design standards in CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| The highway commercial, the minimum lot area is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| The minimum lot width is 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Setbacks are 20 feet at the front and 10 feet at the side and rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and less abutting residential than is 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Maximum height is 40 feet in the CH1 and 90 feet in the CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| The additional height comes in exchange for some minimal design standards in CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| What we're trying to do is provide an incentive and encouragement for better design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| with a greater intensity of development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| There's an additional 50 foot in building height that is provided if you meet minimal design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| In the regional commercial district, the minimum lot area is 15,000 square feet, minimum lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| Width is 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| The setbacks are 20 feet at the front and 10 at the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Again, greater 30-foot setback when abutting residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| The maximum building height is 50 feet in the basic CR zoning district and 90 feet in the CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| Again, there are minimum design standards in CR2 to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| encourage a bit better design that additional 40 feet in height is permitted in CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| You can't see this well, and I apologize for that, but in terms of the table 5-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| I believe it's on page 5-5 of your ordinance if you have your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| The basic design standards are you can't have a blank wall of more than 30 feet, linear feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| if you're abutting a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Those building facades in excess of 100 linear feet along a public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| have to have some type of design feature, articulation, changes in color, pilasters, columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| changes in textures and material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| The building has to have a public entrance on the front facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| The fenestration between 35 and 50 percent, 50 percent in CN and CG3, 35 percent in the CH2 and CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2440)|
| 0:40:54| The upper floors have minimum transparency of 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| The commercial site standards, and this is a safe pedestrian passage from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| or through the parking lot to the front entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Again, these only apply to those zoning districts where additional intensity is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| There's a cohesive character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| If you've got more than one building, the buildings have some type of unifying architectural element,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| and your site has a unifying element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| In CR2, IPE buildings have to have prominent entrances oriented towards the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| and the public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| And IPE buildings that are part of a unified development have to front up closer to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| to provide some street presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| He's given us an overview of the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| You're not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Just to show some photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| The CG1, the CH1, the CR2, as you know, these are two of my favorite buildings in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| most promoted by me in presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| The CG1, the CH1, the CR1 would allow the advanced auto parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| The Bojangles exceeds the design standards of the CG2, the CG3, the CR2, the CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| So we're not establishing a high level of design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| I think most, using the Bojangles as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| most corporate chains and franchises have a design template that would meet the design standards we're putting forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| The greatest distinction between what the CG2 and CG3 do have the built-to zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| so the Bojangles would have to come closer to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| but the building design itself would meet the standards of CG2, CG3, CH2, and CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Okay, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| Are we allowed to ask questions now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Because I'm trying to scribble notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| This is about commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| No, I wanted to talk about residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| I'm going to stick with the template here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| So for clarification, we're on Article 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| I'm jumping right in, but I'm like, I needed to, while you're talking about the screen, I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Without me pulling up the map, what is proposed for the advanced auto parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| That would be a CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| That's proposed as CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And did I hear you correctly say that it could be built in the new proposed CG2 as it sits today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| Not the advanced auto parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| The Bojangles could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| We wouldn't have a blank wall facing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| We would not have blank walls facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Or Edgewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Or Edgewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| There would be requirements for some transparency of fenestration and a public entrance on one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| We wouldn't have two giant concrete walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| Because I feel like it's best for folks to understand that when we can compare it to something that we can see and tangible and we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| So what is being proposed would change that so we wouldn't have two blank walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| And this is something I should point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| We're being very lenient in our non-conforming standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| This building would not have changed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| If the use changed, the building could stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| They could do an addition, expand the floor area up to 50% without meeting any of those design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| They'd be grandfathered non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| But if they were torn down and a new business went in in a different location, they'd have to meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Coming closer to the street and meeting the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| But if the clock were at a different point in time and Broadway Sound still existed today and they hadn't torn it down and built this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2677)|
| 0:44:46| That all happened after you moved here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Broadway Sound was torn down, but this was built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| So it used to be a historic building fronting and addressing the sidewalk with an entrance to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| It was a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| They tore it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| We got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| So the question is, you'd have to have a man entrance to the street front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| You would have to have some fenestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And what would the setbacks be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| There would be a build-to zone of zero to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| So it would front right on the street or it could set back 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Which right now, what's the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| The setback is 25 feet in the C3 district, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| So potentially same setback, but we would have not blank walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| And the major difference between currently as proposed and the setback is a minimum setback, so 25 feet or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2732)|
| 0:45:43| What we're proposing is zero to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| You have to be within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| You can't go farther from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| You're saying that they could build it with recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| They could build what there still is there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Building, they'd have to come closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| They would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Would have the build-to zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| I'll have many other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Some of the corridors, a number of the corridors are zoned CGs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| Broadway, Magnolia, parts of Chapman, Central are largely CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| Kingston Pike is CG1, except at the nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| So the advanced auto parts could go on most of Kingston Pike, except at nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| And the nodes are Humbert Place, Western Plaza, North Shore, and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I think I see some folks maybe standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| So if you want to make a comment, should they just walk up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Not just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| We're going to finish our discussion, and then we'll let them discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| So if we're looking at Article 5, on page 5-1, the first question I have is about subsection A-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| General Commercial Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I would think that this is intended for indoor retail use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| because CH Highway Commercial Zoning District in Number 3 is clearly outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| So I would suggest we make that clearly indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| On page 5-2, subsection 2, OP Office Park Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| If you read through this, it's very clear that certain things are accessory services for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| such as personal services, restaurants, and retail establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| If we move over to the matrix, which I think is in 9-3, I think there's some confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2859)|
| 0:47:50| The staff has already made that comment and sent it to the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| and that will be addressed in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| How is it going to be addressed in the next draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| There's a statement in the use standards in that table that those uses that are identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2879)|
| 0:48:08| and I can't remember them now, but they're secondary to the principal office uses in the office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| and have to be located in a building, the primary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| They have to be located in an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| They can't be freestanding buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| And so I appreciate that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| The issue I see with this is that somebody looking at the matrix and seeing a P under eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| and drinking establishment will think that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| We're changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Okay, so are you going to change it to an A for accessory, or I guess what is the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| We're just making the note, and I haven't seen it yet, leaving it to the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| I do think it needs to be clear that that's accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| We agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| The other part in 5.2 under uses in C1, again, I think these are intended for those in the office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2931)|
| 0:49:00| and not intended to attract outside traffic based on what I'm reading above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Is that also true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| So I think that needs to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| If I drive by Dow Springs Office Park and up in there there's a cafe at the orthopedic center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2950)|
| 0:49:21| and I decide to go in, I don't know that there's any way that I could be prevented from going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2961)|
| 0:49:30| Making that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| I'm not suggesting that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| What I'm asking is this is more akin to a cafe in a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| which is not really intended to be where you go on your date with your spouse necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| Unless it's a good cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Unless it's a really good cafe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| But I think that's the clarification that's needed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| That's what we're working towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| So I'll just stay on that same page then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Under the dimensional standards in 5.3, specifically in A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| should we modify those dimensional standards with adding language about new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| and to any additions of a structure existing as of an effective date of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| and 30 percent or more of square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| The reason for that is I don't know that we want to compel existing structures to comply with a setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| as it might require them to be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| I think that would make it clearer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| That would make it more clear? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| And I can go on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| When we get through a page, I think George has something he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| And I think what I'd like to do is address broad policy issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| As I said to you before, these type of edits, I think most of them we agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| just how it would be more efficient than the other council member time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| And it's certainly in mind at the point we are now trying to get policy issues addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| to address those policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| And I'd be willing to spend whatever amount of time outside this meeting to go through those edits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| and make sure we capture everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Several of them we have, what you've sent me so far, we have caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| And the others, we seem to be of like mind on most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| So I don't imagine we'll have any major disagreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| So let's go back to your advanced auto parts, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| So you say if we don't change the use, you can reuse that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| So retail is its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Do you think that's clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| So if I change it to a restaurant, I've changed the use, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| And we've made a point to call on Peter just in case, Peter Ahrens, just in case I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| But we also, there has to be a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| I've forgotten the exact wording, but change of use and modification to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| and improvements to the, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Could be before we, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Peter, you want to follow up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| This is where the rubber meets the road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Yeah, I think we need to get into the preexisting nonconforming sections, which really helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3143)|
| 0:52:32| That's Article 17, nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| And that's when you apply Article 17 when you've got existing structures and there's a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| Somebody comes in, pulls a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| We evaluate it for zoning compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And we recognize that it's existing, so we look at the nonconformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| and then we look to make sure that if they're meeting the thresholds identified in Article 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3169)|
| 0:52:58| then they have to comply with those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| But if they're, you know, this is one of those things where it gets real difficult on our end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| because whether it's advanced auto or it's some other existing property that's nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| if somebody wants to go in and spend little money and bring a vacant structure back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| and bring it back to life, to automatically say that it has to comply with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3199)|
| 0:53:28| we're seeing where that's problematic, even in the parking section that was adopted in the fall of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| So I think we tried to articulate in Article 17 how existing structures are addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3216)|
| 0:53:47| but I think it is important that we recognize that as soon as a new use goes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| or a permit is pulled to make some changes, that doesn't automatically say the structure needs to be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| There's regulations to go through in Article 17. Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Yeah, I think it makes my point that it's not clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| and it's not clear to the casual reader on just like advanced auto parts changes use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3251)|
| 0:54:20| that the whole thing doesn't have to be removed because it's not meeting, it exceeds the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| It doesn't have the transparency on the side, and it doesn't meet a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| So it's illegal nonconforming, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| And basically, one of the answers to that is…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I mean, I think it's not clear to me, and I think that's exactly how that's going to be dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| if I add so much space to it, where do design standards kick in, where do the setbacks kick in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3289)|
| 0:54:59| the parking, the landscape, and those triggers, as we've called them, to me are not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| That's your prime example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| And we're working on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| And if you look at 2A, D2A on page 7, or Section 17.3, D2A, required Bill 2, zone of Bill 2 line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3308)|
| 0:55:19| when a structure does not conform to the required Bill 2 zone of Bill 2 line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| the applicable district structure is deemed conforming in regard to that standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| and may be expanded or altered without having to conform to the Bill 2 zone of the Bill 2 line of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| until the structure's footprint has exceeded by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So that building would be deemed to be conforming until it's expanded by more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| So by interpreting that it's deemed to be conforming, then the use could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| It could go from retail to restaurant because it's deemed to be a conforming building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| with regard to the setbacks of Bill 2 zones, until it's expanded by more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| Then that expansion has to meet the Bill 2 zone of the use setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| And we're, with the assistance of Peter and Christina, migrants from the law office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| we've clarified in the next draft what we hope is clearer language on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| I think that, I mean, to me they're not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| And I understand, I agree, because we should be able to find this section that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| In defining what that means, you know, change of use, I think it's got to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| I mean, that's my feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I mean, you think it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I mean, Peter's not even saying it's not even clear, so I'm not the only one that thinks it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| I just think it's got to be clear where there's not a lot of subjectivity to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| And we're working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| That's all I had to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| I will, I think I had my light on for another reason, and I forgot why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| But I will say that I agree with Councilman Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| because those are a lot of the calls that we get from the business community is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| I know Peter's gotten calls from me or e-mails from me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| I applied for a sign, and now I've got to do this, this, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| And we don't want to see instances where people don't redevelop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| because it triggers so much that they can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| I'm just trying to make sure that we understand what we're passing before we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| So to echo what he's saying, I want to make sure that we're clear and understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| so that if somebody came along and wanted to turn that into a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| which I don't anticipate, something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| So it's not based on the dollar figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| It's based on, they don't have to put fenestrations and change the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| If they change the use to a restaurant, but they do if they expand the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| Did I understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Because to go from an auto parts store to a restaurant is going to cost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| We want to provide clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Is the part that's not clear based on the location within the code, recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| or that the actual language is unclear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I guess that's what I'd like to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| I think the language is unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| It's not clear what a change of use is going to involve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| And back to what Lauren's saying, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Is it the price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Is it the value of the improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Or is it the expansion and or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| When does the parking lot kick in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| When do I have to meet the design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| And the design standards are only on the new part if it's more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Those kind of things are not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| I will say that I think we can do a good job of making it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| I don't think we'll be able to make it simple for the average person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| because there are a million different variables that we're trying to articulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| Every single option that somebody throws at us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| and so it's not really a one-size-fits-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| It ends up being a lot of different things that we have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| and evaluate before we can give a clear answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| And I don't know if that's – I'd love some feedback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| If you want just a clear answer that's going to be a heavy-handed answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| or you let the cows out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Well, I think there's people out there in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| that probably have a better handle on that than we do on what would make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| I think the other thing on this whole thing of nonconformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| so if I'm allowed outside storage in my zoning today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| and it doesn't allow it in the new zoning going forward and I change the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3591)|
| 0:59:59| The new use has to comply with the new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| To me that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| And I think – to me that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| And exactly how that change of use, how it's defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| I think that would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| But anyway, I'm not sure I agree with that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Councilwoman Reuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| I just want to say I think what Councilwoman Wallace is hitting on is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| and I get from Mr. Ahrens that it's very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| I think that's something that we really need to take some true examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| and figure out what happens to this property, what happens to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Broadway and Asheville Highway, Gwen shares that with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| we've got tons of stuff to get redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| and it's such a struggle when somebody wants to redevelop something and the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| We just want to make sure we understand what we're passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| So if it's a flow chart model or a table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| and I know you're smiling at me because maybe it's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| I think right now the reason you're hearing no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| is because they're meeting that threshold of redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| where in the parking ordinance when that went through in the fall of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| there was a desire that hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| if somebody's putting more than 50% of the value of their property into redeveloping it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| well now they have to bring their parking into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| because there was a desire to get rid of the seas of asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| to get parking lots away from the right-of-way, get landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| And so those are the issues that me and my staff are dealing with every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| is we see people that want to invest in older structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| but we also know that it was the desire with that parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| to remove asphalt, to add landscaping, to beautify that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| And those two both cost money, which is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| So it's based on the dollar figure of the parking and the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| but then also triggered by increasing the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| And to address that issue, that one particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| what we've done with the next revision is remove the building from the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| That means you can do 100% of the value of your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| and building improvements without having to upgrade the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| And again, that may be a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Do you want the seas of asphalt to remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| But we want redevelopment, so that's the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I thought I was clear, honestly, until this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| I am reading under change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| a non-conforming use can only be changed to an allowed use within a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Tell us what page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| I am on page 17-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Section 17.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| 17.2 Part C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| 17.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| I can read the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| But what I'm reading here is that as long as it's a use that's allowed within that zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| it could change from one use to another use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| and they're not going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| They could still be non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| but what I'm hearing is that that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| They can change their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| To another use that is allowed within the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| They can't go back to a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Sorry, I don't want to confuse you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| There's more triggers scattered throughout here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| As you go through, whether it be landscaping, whether it be parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| whether it be locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| and that's where it gets more difficult because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| It's scattered throughout because there's a lot of different variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| We have a citizen out here who has waited very patiently while we have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Did you want to say something, Councilwoman McKenzie, before I go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Sir, if you would please give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| My name is John Shirley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| I'm 11102 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| My family has been in this community for over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| My uncle was a city councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| My great-great-grandfather was a city councilman when they built the original market building at Market Square Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| I'm a real estate developer, mainly in the retail market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| I currently am doing $200 million worth of retail development throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| I've been involved with twice that much in 20 years of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| and I have seen unintended consequences occur in a lot of communities when they open a Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| Some of the planning ideas I applaud, but I have some serious philosophical questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| On your setback, if we could go back to the aforementioned parts store, if we could see that picture, wherever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3923)|
| 1:05:35| In the setback, if the building is more than 20 feet, you're saying that the building can't be more than 20 feet setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3935)|
| 1:05:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| In certain zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Well, that auto parts store right now is 14 feet for two parking spaces, plus at least a 20-foot drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| So we're almost 50 feet setback today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| So what you're telling me is all the parking for all these buildings in the future has to go behind the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| Or beside them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Only in certain zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| What zoning districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| The CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Zoning districts in which I'm working in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I've got a $35 million project at West Ham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| Half of it will get done and be permitted before this goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| The other half won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| So what I've got to do now is I've got to push all my retail buildings to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| And that zoning is changing to either CH1 or CT1, which would have no built-in zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| Well, see, the problem is you were talking about notifying the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| I've met with several major architectural firms in this town, and nobody has an idea what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| I can tell you the development community doesn't understand what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| And I know I've heard rumors of developers that are lorrying up right now because you're getting ready to impact the value of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| Now, the city doesn't need to lose any more car cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| City Attorney Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| And I just want you to understand that I know it's well-meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Listen, I'm not accusing anybody of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| But I have seen this type of implication put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| I developed a shopping center in Raleigh, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| And in Raleigh, you have to put all the shopping center against the road, have all your parking in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| Now, what they decided, and most retailers won't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| You're not going to find a retailer that's going to put a back door into his building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| From an operational standpoint, theft standpoint, they're not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| That's the reason you find very few normal shopping center retailers going into malls, because they don't want two entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| It's a very difficult thing to get past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| So in Raleigh, the shopping center is just turned away from the street so that the back of the shopping center faces towards the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4063)|
| 1:07:53| And they decided that was the solution, and that could be the solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| So we see the back of an undeveloped building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| And I think the solution, again, the only two zoning districts that have a built-in zone are CG2 and CG3, and they're limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| We're limiting them even more in their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| They're for corridors like Broadway that are primarily highly pedestrian-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| Kingston Pike, as I said, is changing to almost within the near-to-downtown area, CG1, that has no setback requirement at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4095)|
| 1:08:26| You can put your building anywhere you want, or CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| Let's use this example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| You're taking the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| I don't mean to argue with you, but you've been less than knowledgeable about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| The zoning districts, that's why we have a range of zoning districts that go from CG, CN, neighborhood commercial, to CG, general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4120)|
| 1:08:49| that has three subsets, to CH, which has two subsets but neither with a built-in zone, to CR, which has two subsets, neither with a built-in zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| So it's more of the application of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Well, I think the point I was trying to make, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| And I think what you have to do is sit down and say, this is what my plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| My time has been reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Mr. Shirley, you've got about 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Well, I think what we want to know, I can tell you the lease on that auto parts store is gone in nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| And with the way that retail is changing on a daily basis because of the Internet, I doubt seriously that retail store will probably be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| And my industry will reuse that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| It will change use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| I'm not worried about us redeveloping this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| I've never been worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Every one of these Kmarts that have come to the market all across the country, we've redeveloped them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| But in that scenario, that building's got to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you, Mr. Shirley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| I would implore you to speak with Director Green after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Well, I just was, again, I think we all have long lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| I just wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| I understand that there's, number one, I think it's important that we hash through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| No matter how painful it is, so we understand and figure out the complications of what we're passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| And I understand what Mr. Shirley is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| I like to walk places, and I live in that walkable district, Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| When I walk somewhere from my home within a two- to three-mile radius, because sometimes the weather's nice, I'll walk that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| It's not fun to walk to a business and have to walk through a giant parking lot to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| You're dodging cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| There's so much of our built environment is not built for people to actually get into a store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| And so, I mean, this is important that we weed through this and figure it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| and come to the happy medium to figure out how to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| It worked downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| It still works downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| I understand that some places aren't like downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| So I will defend the process and defend what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Maybe or maybe not will the advanced auto parts be there, but no one's been in love with it since it went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| It was a building that addressed the street, and it got torn down, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| And now we have two giant concrete walls that nobody's in love with, and it's unattractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| And I can go shop there and still think it's unattractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| Anyway, I'll defer for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| And if I could make one follow-up comment to that and to Mr. Shirley again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| It's very important how we designate different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| In Kingston Pike, we've realized it's more auto-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| So it's becoming, as we change the map, we're recognizing that auto orientation and not requiring build-to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| Broadway, Magnolia, portions of Central where there's more pedestrian field, we are recognizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4298)|
| 1:11:47| So the mapping, that's why we have a range of zoning districts, and the mapping of them becomes very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| and is something that I think it's critical to maintain that provision that up to a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| we will revise the zoning of a property at no fee if we've got it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| Because in some cases, we may not get it right, exactly right, according to what the property owner desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| Okay. Are there any other questions of counsel regarding the commercial districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| So, Gerald, there's parts of, I don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Are there parts of CG2 and CG3 that have a build-to zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| We don't even have a network of sidewalks coming to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| The one that I'm struggling with, because we've identified it as a node, is there at, I think it's Berkside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4352)|
| 1:12:42| North Shore, and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| How do we allow more intense, and maybe we'll just do a basic CH zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| I mean, that's the one area, that's an example of one that I'm struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| I think that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| We're requiring, we're saying we want it to be more walkable, but yet there's sidewalks, terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| there's other factors that would limit, you know, whether you could walk it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| Yeah, and actually, I have to realize I was at a meeting there recently, and actually, there are sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to take a little walk because I got to my meeting early and walked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| So, looking at those nuances and understanding where we want to go, and maybe you're right, we're not quite there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| but how do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Any other questions by Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| When we're looking at office, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| Let's finish commercial first, and then I want to ask those in the audience who have signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| if anybody needs to make a comment about commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| Well, I thought we were looking at Article 5, which is commercial and office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| If you want to ask it about office, let's do that in the next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| So, if we still have a question on commercial, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Yeah, I know they're both the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Yeah, that was a confusing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Yeah, I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Any questions specifically about commercial that we've?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| I know you haven't signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| You want five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| I want less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| It sounded like, with the discussion with Peter and the fact that there are a number of triggers that determine how they would address the change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4464)|
| 1:14:34| the danger is, of course, that it becomes all discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| You have to sit down with the department and work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| I mean, that will work, but I heard the gentleman speaking who does commercial redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| It might be prudent to develop, I don't know what the right word is now, a notebook, a workbook, an appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| where some of those examples can be illustrated, not as binding text for the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| but if change of use is a big thing, and I think Ms. Ryder said places like Broadway and Asheville Highway and others are going through that redevelopment phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4500)|
| 1:15:10| some kind of an illustration book that just gives you examples would make it easier to communicate with the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| I don't know if that's a good idea or a bad one, but I throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Carlene, do you want to speak on the commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| And this has to do with building materials, and it's page 5-6, Article 5, Section 5.4B, Building Materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4530)|
| 1:15:41| It says aluminum, steel, and other metal siding does not apply to CN or office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| Those sidings will be restricted in other zones, but not in CN, neighborhood, commercial, or office, which are right next to our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4548)|
| 1:16:03| Those restrictions also apply, if you look further in the document, to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| You can't use those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| If we're going to have building material restrictions, why are we going to restrict the building materials on heavier commercial and industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| but not the buildings that are in the middle of our neighborhoods and between our neighborhoods and these other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| It just sounds backwards to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| I also just would like to say regarding commercial and other office and industrial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| all of you, I hope, receive from the community forum a document reviewing Draft 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| We're not going to address all of those out of kindness and a sense of sympathy for mankind tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| We're not going to go through all of them, but we stand by them to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Vice Mayor, I think Ms. Malone deserves an answer to her question, so if it's okay, I'll answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| It's on my list. Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| The reason for that is that those material restrictions, and they've been reduced somewhat based on conversations with representatives of AIA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4622)|
| 1:17:12| but the material restrictions apply to, other than the office and the neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| apply to those zoning districts of CG2, CG3, CH2, and CR2 where there's a greater intensity of development per minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4637)|
| 1:17:26| The reason for that, having those material restrictions and some design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| we're allowing you to build a bigger building, and we hope that that larger building will enable you to recoup the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| that these materials may result in you incurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| The reason that those limitations on the metal, aluminum, and steel sidings are not in the office and neighborhood commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4664)|
| 1:17:56| is there's no incentive to provide it. There's no additional intensity provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| so we didn't want to place a burden on anyone that wanted to develop in the CN and office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| On the other districts, you'd get greater intensity, so the restrictions are a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| All right. Thank you. Do you want to ask on the move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| I will only talk about commercial, but I'm telling you these restrictions are what we can talk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| It's hard when you've got to flip back and forth and you've got the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| I know there's a lot of overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| I know. So much overlap. It all ties together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Can I follow up on what was just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| We'll get to industrial. I can ask it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| So it is restricted vinyl and aluminum siding and those materials in industrial, correct, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4716)|
| 1:18:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| That's okay. I won't talk about industrial now. We can talk about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| But I am asking Gerald a question, so I'll give him two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| Technical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4743)|
| 1:19:15| Okay. So I'll set it up maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| So CG, I'm going to talk slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| He can hear me? His ears are on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Okay. CG, one thing that stands out, we've got CG1, CG2, CG3, which we've just touched on a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4765)|
| 1:19:35| Number one, Gerald, a while ago when you were introducing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| you said something about there being step-down height when it's next to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Not in CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| It will be in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| The consultants have been asked to provide that step-down in all the zoning districts that allow greater heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| Okay. Thank you for mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| CG2, CG3, CH2, and CR2 where there's greater heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| Okay. Because that helped me remember what I forgot my light was on for a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| And it was on because you mentioned the consultants, Camaras, and you also mentioned the next version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| Could you elaborate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| So we have the fifth version here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I've seen something in an email about another version and a date that it was to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| You were 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| So this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| How much is going to change in the next version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| I think I sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Is that what we got today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| I can't even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| I'll go dig around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| I'll put it on cat emails this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| So that's going to change the step-down and that will be in the next version that we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| So point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| In CG3, it's, and in several of these, and also in the office, but I'll try not to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4859)|
| 1:21:08| Unless abutting a residential district, 25-foot rear setback and a 20-foot setback on interior side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| it was pointed out to me that in the open space, and I'll try not to talk about open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| but in open space, if I can find my tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| I made a note here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| It's tangential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| We need to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| 40 feet setback for, I know, for rear, maybe interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| I don't want a page number here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| To my thinking, an unlimited height building, what is the step-down going to be for CG3 in the next version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| At the setback line, the maximum height is 45 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and then for every one foot and increased setback, the height can increase two feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| But we're going to, so this version, though, has lower setbacks than what open space does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| which potentially would be smaller buildings in open space, like in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| We're talking about our parks buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Do we think that's, what's the rationale behind having-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| Allowing more intense development of those commercial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| reduced setbacks is one of those ways of permitting more intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| The open space, the purpose of open space is to preserve that open area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| so the greater setbacks would allow that goal to be met of increased open areas, not for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4950)|
| 1:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| And then this is, it is about commercial, mentioned in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Gas stations are a special use allowed in CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Has that been discussed in all the public meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Has anybody talked about 24-hour gas stations with lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| No one has said they did not like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| We got comments saying that it should be a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| that why are we restricting gas stations in the CN district, or the CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| and there are gas stations in existing CN districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I guess I can go through the map and figure out where those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| One is at Sonotaco, the gas station across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| I think it's Lancaster and Severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| I'll leave it at that maybe for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Let's move on to office, and I know there's some overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| so if you can touch on the differences, and then we'll go through the same routine with council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| and then if anybody in the public wants to make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I covered a lot of the office before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| All I'm going to do now is just mention the design standards in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| and this is that in order to, one, all office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| all uses, structures in the office district would have to comply with these basic standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Building material and visual elements used on the primary building frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| must wrap around any frontage that's visible from the public right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| so you can't have stone on the front and then vinyl on the side that faces the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| The stone would wrap around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| There's a transparency of 50% on the first floor along the front facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| That's a street-facing facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| And the pedestrian access, ensure safe pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| those are the basic design standards in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| There are some additional standards that have to be met if your building exceeds 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5087)|
| 1:24:56| and those are, I had them on a separate list, but I can't find them on the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5096)|
| 1:25:05| In your ordinance, it's section 5.3 on page 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5105)|
| 1:25:16| And this applies to the office district and the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| that the development maintains the privacy of adjacent residential lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| through techniques such as decreased height, additional landscape and screening requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| building massing, and design to mitigate adverse impacts of noise and lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| and increased setbacks above those required from adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| Building design incorporates pedestrian-scale features such as awnings and storefront windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| and the design of the site's circulation system provides adequate and safe access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| for both motor vehicles and alternative modes of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| It's a fairly reasonable standard to exceed 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| in an office and neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| I've got a question about that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| The maximum gross floor area, if you look at table 5.1, is 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| just like you said, unless you're meeting the standards of 5.3b.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| Currently, it's, I think, 30% of the lot, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5183)|
| 1:26:31| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| I guess the thing I'm concerned about is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| what's the rationale for changing from that 30% standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| Obviously, the lots could be many different sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| You know, can we end up with, you know, odd-looking office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| if we have it at 10,000 versus at the 30%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| And, you know, maybe you can comment on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| but I haven't heard a lot of complaints about office buildings with that 30% rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| So it seems like I'm just not clear why we make that change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5225)|
| 1:27:17| And I would say these were developed by our consultants, the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| and their purpose in setting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| At first, it was 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| And we received to provide for buildings that sort of made that transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| from commercial to the residential districts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| And I'm trying to go through their thinking in coming up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| I would imagine that they would think that a building that's trying to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5262)|
| 1:27:50| you have a two-acre parcel, which is roughly 90,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| Thirty percent of that is a 30,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| That's a huge building next to a 1,200-square-foot home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| or some 1,200-square-foot homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| Even though it's on two acres, its location could be abutting that residential home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| looming over that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| It could be a 10,000-square-foot footprint, three stories high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| looming over a single-family home, one-story single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| And I would imagine that their thinking was that by capping the building size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| we adhere to that purpose of being a transition zone between these two districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| better than just the 30% of the land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| I'm sorry I had to pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Because I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| You're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| It's a difficult position to be in to try to conjure up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I think I told you earlier today that one mistake in preparing for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| was me being here and not the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| I guess the thing I'm looking at there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| I think what I'm looking at there is that it seems like these are pretty onerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| for somebody who's trying to build an office building to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| And I would disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| I do it respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| but I think there comes a time when we have to sort of raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| 10,000 square feet for an office building adjacent to a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| is a reasonable-sized building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| To say that they have to maybe sit back an additional 10 feet from the adjacent area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| have some storefront windows or larger windows on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| and that they have a sidewalk from their parking lot to the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| I don't see as onerous, respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Yeah, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| The issue, I think, would be is 10,000 enough for them to be able to do these buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5373)|
| 1:29:42| Does it need to be more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| There's not an issue with it at 30% right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| so is this something that's necessary for us to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| And I think that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| And what we're trying to do is come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I think it's more objective to have just a basic square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| and then some fairly objective standards and something that 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| And I'll challenge my office and Peter's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| If someone has two acres, builds a 30,000-square-foot building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| or one acre of it has all their parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| five years later they come in and subdivide that lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| we would do it at an administrative plant, probably never catch that provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| because our staff who does subdivision lots would not think of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| They go to Peter's office with their one-acre lot that's been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| and put a 15,000-square-foot building on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| And I think that becomes an enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Maybe the reason it's not a problem is that's happened and we've never caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Yeah, well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| As I think that CN, 5,000 maximum square footage is an arbitrary number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5449)|
| 1:30:58| I think 10,000 on an office is arbitrary as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| So if I want a 15,000-square-foot office, two-story building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| no big deal, it's under your height, what zone would I have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| Office park would work or any of the commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Or you could, again, set the building back an additional 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| put larger windows or awning over your door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| or a little front porch on your door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| and have a sidewalk from your parking lot to your front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| which are things in the offices I go to in Knoxville are fairly standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5486)|
| 1:31:35| I think those are arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| I think they are onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| I think they're limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| I mean, that's the way I see it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| I mean, we just did a rezoning over in the Old North two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| That building is way over 10,000 square feet up against residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| and it's on a front street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| I mean, there's a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| There's a lot of, I think, anything under 15,000 would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| And I don't think that building was over 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| I will say the building is huge, but my caveat would be it wouldn't get built again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| That's an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| There's a lot of that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| So what happens if a building, so now I'm in an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5540)|
| 1:32:28| and it's more than 10,000 feet and you apply this standard to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5548)|
| 1:32:39| it just becomes illegal, non-conforming going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| And that's something we're working to clear up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| that those existing buildings are made non-conforming by setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| and we need to clarify that by size are considered conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| What would happen on a remodel, an extensive remodel of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| if I don't change the use, what happens on an extensive remodel of that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| when it's non-conforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| Article 17.3b.3, you're allowed to have an alteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| as long as it doesn't create a new non-conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and doesn't increase the degree of an existing non-conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| So if it's too big, if it's greater than 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| you can't put an addition on it because you would increase a non-conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| But you can do stuff inside, internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| that doesn't necessarily increase the non-conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| Okay, and as long as I didn't increase, so I couldn't increase the size of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| so then the parking, I wouldn't have to change the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| The way it's written, if you invest more than 50% of the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5629)|
| 1:33:57| that triggers parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| and that's something that I'm hoping with the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| We've given Gerald and the consultants some revised language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| to try and address some of the issues that we're dealing with currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| So I think if you haven't increased the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| haven't changed the parking, all I've done is interior work on an office redo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| which very easily could exceed the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| So there's another one of the triggers that's not real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| It's in a lot of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| You've got to really dig for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| and whether or not I've got to also do the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| I think when I say it's not clear, to me that's kind of where you get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| You want to say something wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| I think it could easily be $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| I think it could easily be $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| I think the neighborhood commercial, you've got it at $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| We've raised the neighborhood commercial to $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| To $10,000? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| And again, another option may be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| in trying to preserve the use of this district as a transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| maybe an option would be if it's over $10,000 or whatever number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| it becomes a special use and just an additional review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| which may be less onerous in terms of overall cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5718)|
| 1:35:26| but it's just an additional review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| So that could be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| That's it for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Attorney Frosch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| I was listening to what Council Member Wallace was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| the discussion about the 10,000 square foot office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| If you didn't change it, or if you did change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| you changed the footprint of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| it would lose its grandfather status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| I've been trying to listen and look at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| I thought elsewhere in this current draft that if you had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| preexisting nonconforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| that you were allowed to expand the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| You could expand that preexisting use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| So is my recollection wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| We're talking two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| You're talking a use and expanding a use within a conforming building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| versus a nonconforming building with a conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| Are there any other questions from Council regarding the office now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| And I know there's a gentleman sitting right behind the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| but I can barely see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| If you would please give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| And this is on either office or commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| since we've kind of got the two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| And Michael Stinson, 1401 Coessa Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| What was your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Michael Stinson, S-T-I-N-S-O-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| I am a father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| I'm a husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I own two properties here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| So I do have a little bit of business that I try to take care of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| But first and foremost in opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I like to always start out with a little bit of a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| I do like a little bit of reading as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| But as I'm listening to a lot of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| some of the major concerns that I'm having is the amount of convolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| that there is within this paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| It is not written in a form that's actually meant to be understood by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| and especially hearing how this is going to have an impact on Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| This is from the book 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Every record has been destroyed or falsified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| Every book rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Every picture has been repainted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Every statue and street building has been renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| Every date been altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| And the process is coming day by day and minute by minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| History is stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Nothing exists except in endless present in which the party is always right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| And with this being the case of what I'm seeing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| Knoxville is a very historic location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| It's a beautiful location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| That's one of the reasons why I actually moved down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| And you are talking with these buildings that are actually found to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| nonconformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| What is the general benefit to the public as well as to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| For example, you want to move these businesses closer to a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| And if that business is going to be closer to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| that means that the parking is going to be moved to the side or to the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| away from the safe being of the general people that are actually inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5920)|
| 1:38:47| They have the windows that they can actually view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| If you're walking around to the back of a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| that means that there is a very serious potential for crime to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| And with that being the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| why is it necessary to actually move these buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| especially when you start looking at the content of how it can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| negatively impact the property values within Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| just because when it comes down to the amount of impact that it will have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| the property, whether it's conforming or nonconforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| Since you asked, again, as I stated earlier, two of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| two of the eight commercial zoning districts have built two zones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| require them to come within some distance of the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| The reason for that is, as Council Member Ryder said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| there are lots of pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| that include commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| When we think about most of Broadway, Central are two prime examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| portions of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| We're replicating the type of development that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| We're not doing a broad brush where all the commercial has to front the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| It's very specific, and again, it goes to the mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| We're trying to create environments where everyone feels safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| not just those in a motor vehicle who have the convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| but also when Council Member Ryder goes for a walk down Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| that she doesn't confront it with a number of sidewalks or parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| and weaving through parking lots and can go into a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| So, again, it's providing options, not one-size-fits-all that we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| suburban template for our entire city, but that we have urban templates also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| It's very fair to say that one-size-doesn't-fit-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| Now, with the Camaros, this is one of the big questions that I actually have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| You have to forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| From what I'm understanding, the general populace has had, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| two years that this has been going on for with the drafting of this bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| I just found out about this about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| And the issue that I'm having is that Camaros, they actually got quite the track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6062)|
| 1:41:10| One of their primary spots that they actually did the codes for was Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| I don't know if you know much about the living quality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| Yes, sir. You've only got about 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Well, the simple state of the matter is that when it comes down to making the people aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| everyone I have spoken with has never heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I try to read through this as much as I can, and there are several points that I'm seeing severe concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| And with the Constitution, it actually states specifically, under the consent of the governed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| we are the governed, and I understand that, I acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| You are talking about making a decision that is going to impact the livelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| and the lives of everyone within this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| And with that being the case, I feel that it is imperative that every person that owns property within this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| is notified prior, not after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Okay. Thank you very much for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| I do want to point out, you can make comments anytime online at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| Ricode-Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Ricode-Knoxville. Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| Like I said, I just found out about this a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| and there has been nothing that I can actually see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| If you actually have your ads in one newspaper, what happens if you don't get that newspaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| It's the only newspaper of general circulation in the town, so that's where we put the ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| Okay. Are there other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| I just wanted to ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| Mr. Green, are there copies of this in case there happens to be someone here tonight that doesn't have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6160)|
| 1:42:48| We have some copies in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| But not down here? Okay. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Okay. Are there other comments, questions about office and or commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| I think if we're moving on, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| All right. Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| that we take a ten-minute break and reconvene at 725.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=6183)|

| 1:57:40| the policy issues that you sent to us this afternoon, so I will give the floor to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7060)|

| 1:57:53| This was designed to be applied to older character giving structures, standard knitting mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7073)|
| 1:58:01| uses of that site, buildings close to downtown, older industrial sites I saw in downtown and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| near downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7088)|

| 1:59:07| compatible uses to serve employees, there are things on some eating and drinking establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7147)|
| 1:59:14| and other activities or uses permitted here to serve those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| The general industrial district is just what it says, it provides an opportunity or zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| for a wide range of general industrial uses with limited outside impacts and they typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| do not involve clients or customers coming to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7170)|
| 1:59:36| Heavy industrial district is those, again the name is pretty descriptive, heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| uses, fabricating processes, warehousing, distribution and they may result in non-moderate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7183)|
| 1:59:50| external impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| The industrial mixed use district, there's no minimum lot area, no minimum lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| it is designed for more urban areas with a build to zone, the setbacks of 15 feet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| the rear and zero on the side with 15 feet of abutting a residential area, maximum building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7205)|
| 2:00:13| height is 50 feet, we've had some comments that that height may not be adequate, we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| not have to increase the height, again there are some basic design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| Research and development district, minimum lot size is 2 acres, minimum lot width is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| 10 feet, greater setbacks 50, 40 and 30 and a maximum height of 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| General industrial district, about a quarter acre minimum lot size, 60 foot minimum lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| width, fairly minimal setbacks, 25 in the front, 10 on the side, 50 when abutting residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| 15 at the rear, 25 when abutting residential and the maximum building height is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7248)|
| 2:00:56| In the heavy industrial, again about a quarter acre minimum lot size, minimum lot width is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| 100 feet, same setbacks as the general industrial and same maximum building height of 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| The industrial mixed use has these design standards again, the blank wall restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| the building facades in excess of 100 feet have to have some architectural feature, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| buildings have a public entrance on the front from sidewalks and building materials along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| the front elevation have to wrap around any side elevation that abuts public right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7290)|
| 2:01:38| The ground floor has 50% transparency, upper floor is 15% and the site designed to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| safe pedestrian access and this is only the industrial mixed use which explains why there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| was some concern when the industrial mixed use was applied to more industrial sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| Again, it's meant for those character giving sites such as the standard knitting mill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7316)|
| 2:02:02| others that may be redeveloped for a mixture of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| That's it on industrial, I'll save the policy issues until there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| Questions of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| Yeah, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| What's the difference between industrial R&D and office park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| Why do you need industrial R&D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| What does that allow you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| There may be manufacturing or processing within the building and that would be permitted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| the industrial R&D as opposed to the office park would not be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| Light manufacturing would not be permitted in office park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| Looking at the 6.3 dimensional standards, if you go back to page 5.4, you made some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7369)|
| 2:02:59| changes in that commercial where you apply it to new construction and to any additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| to a structure existing as the effective date of this code of 30% or more in square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| Why not do the same thing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| For the industrial mix used with the design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Yeah, under 6.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| Why wouldn't we add the same language that's in 5.4 there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| I'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| Off the top of my head, I can't think of any reason why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| The other question is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| If you'll send those to me...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| I will, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| I'm not sure I'll remember them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| You know, I'll try to remember them all too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| Also in 6.3, under IH, your setback on the side is more than on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7421)|
| 2:03:51| It's 50 feet versus 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| I guess, what's the rationale for having that difference there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7434)|
| 2:04:01| It's more on the side than on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| Again, that came from the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| I'm trying to have more space between the buildings as you're looking from the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| to allow for outside storage, warehousing, if there's a loading dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| those types of facilities on the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| Well, maybe we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| Because I'm not sure why you would have the setback be swung that way, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| Okay, other questions of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Anybody in the audience want to talk about the industrial districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| If you would, please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| And you have up to five minutes, and you can watch the clock up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Jeff Gamble, 5401 Inchville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| I'm an employee at Riley Foods, a councilman at McKenzie area, Marble City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7495)|
| 2:05:03| One thing that I did see that precluded us a dozen years ago, the height requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7503)|
| 2:05:10| We built a structure that's 90 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| We have two structures that are 90 feet tall on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| You can't see it unless you get back to where we're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| However, we couldn't have expanded when we built our roasting facility to do coffee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| because our green bean coffee storage tower is 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| Our instant coffee tower, which is also 90 feet, that was built there in 1959,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| we've just recently taken on making Kraft Maxwell House instant coffee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| added 25 employees, but maybe we'll consider making it 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| Because most building structures, even towers like that, are typically 80 or 90 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| because of wind and seismic things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| So it may be something we want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| If not, let's move on then to the policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| I'm sorry, sir, if you will give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| and you have up to five minutes to talk about industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| My name is Richard Esparza, and I'm representing WETR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| a radio station on 1621 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| I was just going to say, I'm seeing a bit of a blind eye being turned to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7577)|
| 2:06:24| and if any business owner would like to talk about this on the radio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| we'd be more than happy to have you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| It seems like some changes will be coming your way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| and it looks to be anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| I don't know, I don't have a firm grasp or a complete grasp that it's going to be anti-business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| but it seems like what I've gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| you guys want the rest of the city to look like the Cumberland Avenue strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| and Knoxville is the only city I know of to close a Crystal Burger restaurant twice in a college town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7617)|
| 2:07:07| So, like I said, if anybody from the business community would like to come on, we'd love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7627)|
| 2:07:15| Our email address is realnewsradio at gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| I'm sorry, we're not doing advertising for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| I'm not advertising anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| I'm just saying that our email address is realnewsradio at gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| That's fine. Thank you for your comment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| Now, are there any questions other than industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| Now, let's talk about policy issues, Cheryl. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7657)|
| 2:07:45| What's under the umbrella of policy issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I mean, are we... I'm trying to follow your agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| Oh, we're going to that handout that we got tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7675)|
| 2:08:08| The first one, and these were identified based on comments from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| questions that arose, those issues that seemed to rise to the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| and we've hit on some of them, others we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| The first one is the application of the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| to non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| And as I stated in the handout that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7707)|
| 2:08:34| the Hillside standards apply to properties that have a slope 15% or greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7714)|
| 2:08:41| and they limit density and grading in direct proportion to the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7721)|
| 2:08:50| As the slope gets greater, the limitations become greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| The impact on non-residential districts is with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| primarily with the grading limitation, land disturbance limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| There's some concern that that would limit the ability to develop property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| And this has changed a bit based on some changes in the mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| but it's approximately correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| Of the 7,600 acres of commercially zoned property in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| there's approximately 300 acres of undeveloped property that falls in the Hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| So again, out of 7,600 acres of commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| there's about 300 acres of undeveloped property that would fall in the Hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| Of the 5,400, approximately 5,400 acres of industrially zoned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| again, there's approximately 300 acres of undeveloped industrially zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7782)|
| 2:09:49| that would fall in the Hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| We're trying to clarify that these standards would not apply to existing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| We've got to clarify that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| We made that clarification with the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| since this was initially applied only to residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| that it would not apply to existing development and existing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| I think that would clarify or take some of the burden away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| and help with the development and redevelopment of commercial and industrial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| But it is an issue, and I think it's something that the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| has identified as a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| And again, something that we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| the impact on commercial properties and commercial and industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7827)|
| 2:10:33| that may arise from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| I think the intent is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| It's certainly challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| And there are impacts in developing steeper property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| But there is a tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| So I wanted to make the Council aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| Any questions on the Hillside and Ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| Yeah, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| So what you're saying, Gerald, is as it is stated in this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| that it will be codified in the new updated draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| Well, it's in our current draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| and those clarifications would be in the upcoming draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| Yeah, it was actually an ordinance that was passed two councils ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7871)|
| 2:11:18| but never codified. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| It was adopted in 2011 and never codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| And at the direction of Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| we applied it first to residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| then to all properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| And will be codified with the updated version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| across the city for residential and commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Ms. Malone, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| I think Councilman Campin served on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| It was a task force that took two years coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| with a Ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| That was not codified, as was pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| The only way it was being enforced under the present zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| is in the plan zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| We've gotten rid of it because then there you had a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| so you could enforce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Those plan zones are scheduled to be gone and recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| So without codifying it, there would be no way to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| to have enforced in any way regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| having to do with Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| Unfortunately, and I talked with Mr. Green about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| as the meeting was beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| unfortunately I think the language that is presently in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| in draft four, is incoherent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| We could not, and we've spent 100 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| asking everyone we know to read it and tell us what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| They can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| Mr. Green says it's being worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| and we take him at his word, but we want to make it very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| we think this is very important and we think it needs to be very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| and we need to know what's being protected and what isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| Are there any other comments on Hillside and Ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| If not, next Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| I'll make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| I'm looking for that, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| I think in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| there is a lot that is unclear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| about what is in the language in the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| And I think this is a great example of an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| where we really need some legal review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| to look over what we have in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| and make sure what we have is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| I think that doing that makes a lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| and not just necessarily for Hillside and Ridgetop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| but throughout the entire document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| making sure that, you know, this is, looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| it's definitely a document that's been written by planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| and planners are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| But, you know, if there's a legal challenge in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| it's going to come from lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| And I think there are instances where you can see language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| that, you know, maybe in this one section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| but in lots of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| we're keeping current language is probably more advantageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| because it's already been vetted to the legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| And we have had staff from the city law office reviewing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| and since there was a big of planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| I would say that we may have opposing goals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| First, to make things clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| and then to have a lawyer write them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| So I'm not sure we can meet both those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8086)|
| 2:14:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| Yeah, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| So if I understand the question, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| I mean, we're already applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| the hillside protection standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| to residential in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Only when there's a planned...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| Only when...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| ...road zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| And that we have planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| And it's a recommendation from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| and typically upheld by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| when they review projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| But it's no firm basis for applying those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8123)|
| 2:15:30| at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| So you're asking us, as a policy matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| if we're going to support codifying it in recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| in this draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| That's what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| So for me to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| make sure I understand what Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| was hitting on and what Mr. Green just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| the previous language for the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| and protection plan was not codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| but there was a particular language that was vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| And so what's the impetus for changing the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| Gerald, you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| Gerald's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| It's better than Director Green anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| I'll call you that when I'm mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| And it was not codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| There's no existing language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| The planning staff has a chart that says if a slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| and this comes from the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| or hillside and roadstop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| that if a slope is 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| then your density is limited X to X| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| and your disturbed area is limited to X percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| And if your slope is 25% to 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| the standards change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| and if it's 40% or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| there's a greater limitation on density and disturbed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| And we just apply that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| or recommend an application of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| in planned commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| And this is the first time we tried to codify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| and put actual language in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| based on those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| of the hillside and roadstop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| And I admit, I think we did a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| with some of the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| When we had residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| when we applied commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| tried to apply to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| the wording from the consultants got a little murky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| and I agree that it needs to be better vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| because even I, as a planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| lost an eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| Couldn't clearly understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| so we're rewriting that language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| and we'll have new language in the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| that will be out February 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| And who's working on the rewrite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| Not the, not Camero's, but?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| We give direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| When I say we, it's city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| whose direction is funneled through Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| and then planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| whose direction is funneled through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| And we give, and Peter and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| agree on items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| and we send them to the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| and they are charged with taking our direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| and then putting it in the appropriate place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| Okay, can I just make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| Since I'm holding the mic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| We're going to get a new draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| on February 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| and we're having another workshop on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| That workshop is going to deal with residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| so there may be some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| or clarifications in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| But that'll be our focus next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| And I understand the concern with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| about the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| but we're trying to incorporate revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| and we, just to explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| we have to review things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| take comments from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| then Peter and I have to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| to come up with a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| direct the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| They draft the new language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| and a new draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| send it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| we have to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| approve the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| send it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| So it's not a quick...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| It's tedious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| It's tedious in trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| we address everything in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Section 5.3 matches with Section 6.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| and that we have consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| and clarity throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| I'm just concerned about our timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| for being able to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| and process things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| from getting it on the 18th to the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| There won't be many changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| in the residential sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| Okay, and we'll only be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| to talk about that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| The next policy...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| Next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| Let me ask Gerald a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| With all these revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| will we get down to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| Okay, there's your final revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| Final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| Final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| No more changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| Does it have to go back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| for them to look at it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| go back through their process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| and vote on it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| to come back to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| And I'm putting words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| and trying to interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| what Charles Swanson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| that the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| through their review and updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| and workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| considered every aspect of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| and that their changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| would not have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| through the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| because they've considered various options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| And a lot of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| that we're doing are clarifying the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| changing the language to clarify the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| adjusting the height and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| And we've talked about all those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| They've heard the comments, seen the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| prior to their action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8445)|
| 2:20:51| Ms. Malone, apparently you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| address this same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| If I could just ask for a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| Are we just dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| with Articles 5 and 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| so it's inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| to speak about signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| in office commercial and industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| We're just talking about what's in 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Articles 5 and 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| if we want to talk about everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| having to do with office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| and commercial and industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| signs are important and there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| big problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| But those issues are actually separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| from this. We've already passed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| of course, I think in 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| Is that right, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| You seriously need to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| at the signs section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| as it has been put in the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| There are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8500)|
