| 1744.44 | 1748.44 | I guess I'd like to address the Nashville shooting in particular.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1744.44)            |
| 1748.44 | 1752.44 | There was no point during that that a red flag law would have prevented it.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1748.44)            |

| 1757.44 | 1761.44 | So I would like to address red flag laws                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424?start=1757.44)            |
