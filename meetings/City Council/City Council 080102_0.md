| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Real quickly on mayor's report, two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| You all should have all received tonight a copy of the new organization chart with all reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| responsibilities and phone numbers for all those appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| If you didn't get one of those, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| But if there's any questions on that, you're welcome to ask us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Secondly, I want to announce some good news on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| As you all know, we've been working for a while with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| and the Fort Sanders Hospital System on the Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| And I love this because, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| they're both contributing to this idea of putting someone in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| And I'm really pleased to announce that Ann Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| who is currently with the Metropolitan Planning Commission, has been a part of their planning team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| And I think we all, at least our main interaction has been on the downtown design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| which has been wonderfully done in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| So Ann has agreed to come join us and head up the Cumberland Avenue project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| which I'm really, really excited about and grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| So I wanted to announce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Literally, that news is all of about three hours old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| But Bob, she'll be working with Bob Wetzel within the Policy and Communications Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| So we're very excited to have Ann here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| The only other thing I had, I was going to make fun of her tonight, but tomorrow is Cindy Mitchell's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| So you'll just have to tell her in person tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| She, knowing that, she ducked the meeting tonight if she's home watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Why wouldn't she be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| First, at the request of a constituent, I've asked Mr. Swanson about beginning the process concerning the senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=275)|
| 0:04:44| citizen property tax freeze matter that was passed, you know, in the last gubernatorial election, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=284)|
| 0:04:54| if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| So that's going to be coming sometime in, I guess, the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| Something for folks to begin to think about how we're going to proceed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| Second issue is, I don't know if this is, you know, Bill Lyons' department or who's, I notice we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| reading the paper, the big stories of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| We're getting ready to come up on the anniversary of the bad fire at the McClung warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| And I was wondering if at the next council meeting or the one after we could be given a brief update of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| we're standing right now and how we're going to be going forward and try to establish some type of time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| because the problem still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| And, you know, we need to try to get some sort of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Bill, you want to give that update at the next council meeting or now if you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| One of the next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| I think we'll be ready by, we talked about today or by the next council meeting or the following one to update you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| We'll do it the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| That's a good request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I don't know who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| I'll go with the Vice Mayor because Ms. Pelos is pointing at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I also wanted to also mark another great occasion just as we mark Cindy Mitchell's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| We also here very recently had one of our own staff members celebrate her 25th year of employment with the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| Ms. Susan Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| We appreciate all the work she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| We wanted to recognize that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| And we will have something in the very near future for you, a little token of our appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| And we thank you, Susan, for everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Thanks, Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Ms. Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Well, I'm going to comment also on a staff member that I think I'm sure you have personally thanked her many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| But I just want to thank Mickey, Melanie, and all her troops for all of the work that they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| Knoxville just looked wonderful during the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| And it doesn't happen without a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Now, I know Mickey is not watching us tonight for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| But maybe somebody can pass that word along to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Because truly, truly, we owe that entire group of employees a wonderful hand of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| And appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| We had some wonderful nights during the holiday celebration, Christmas in the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| They did a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| More people downtown than have ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Lots of people who aren't regulars, which is part of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And I'm just going to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| We brought some grandchildren down to skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| And that was just fantastic fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| I didn't think it was wise for me to attempt to skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| And I didn't make the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| But it just looked like a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Got to talk with a lot of people who are having a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| And just want to be sure that's an annual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| So, I want to thank Larson J's outfit and those others that made that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| We'll pass that on to them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=481)|

| 0:16:43| We're also making improvements to the front of the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| There's some sidewalk work that has to be done in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| There's a timeline in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Is it anticipated completion sometime in May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| We hope to have the plans from the tenant by the 1st of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Assuming we get them by then, then May is a doable time to turn that over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Then how long will it take the restaurant to do its build-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| I believe we're going to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| They've got to do their under-slab work, and we've got a little bit of work to do with them there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| Once we get that done, then we'll pour the slab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Essentially, that's the main scope of our work, to turn them loose to do their tenant finish build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| I think they're estimating approximately another three months to get an operation, maybe around the 1st of September, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| Or sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1066)|

| 0:17:58| I've visited one of his locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| I know this will be his third in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Maybe he could give us a little commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1081)|

| 0:18:25| It is a fast-casual hamburger place, fast-casual in the sense you come in and order at the counter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| but then everything is cooked fresh for you at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1112)|

| 0:18:54| UT Athletic Department has been great and has donated some pictures that we've blown up to four feet by 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| Six feet large and four feet by four feet large and have TVs in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| It's a very family-friendly environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1146)|

| 0:19:11| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| That's a good summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Any other questions on the agenda item at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Just by way of reminder, that was part of the money that was included when we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| budget amendment with the surplus funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| That was part of the money that was included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| The rent numbers that the city will be receiving for that are located in the previous agenda item, like the first term is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| $52,000 per month and then increases from there, excuse me, per year and then increases from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| That sounded really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Collin just about had a heart attack when I said per month, per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1195)|

| 0:19:58| 11F, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute and deliver a second amendment to the city's ground lease with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| Riverside Tavern at Vargas, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1207)|

| 0:20:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Similar to the last one, just a brief explanation because we've gone, you know, for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| because we've gone through so many iterations of this whole agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| In 19, the lease was signed, I believe, in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| The lease involved an obligation on Riverside Tavern's part to construct the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| And it was constructed in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| It was just recently learned that the south outside patio of the restaurant encroaches over the original lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1236)|
| 0:20:46| line by some small amount of square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And what this amendment does is to add an additional 1,638 square feet to the lease to accommodate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Can we lease it to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| It sounds like what you ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| I think he thinks we have a habit of just needing to revise lot sizes and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1274)|

| 0:22:00| indulgence, could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1320)|

| 0:22:09| I would just like to continue to thank the City of Knoxville for the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| We've been able to serve the community for over 20 years and have not been able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| this without a lot of support from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| I would hate to think that our tax dollars and the dollars that we raise to help the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| kids and the folks needing treatment in this community would go to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| And so this goes a long way into making sure that we are able to provide more services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| and more assistance in the community than we're able to do with paying operating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| So we're greatly appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| We've been able to reach over 8,000 Knox County students this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Today, as always happens right after the New Year's, our phones have been ringing off the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| And we were able to refer over 500 people last year and try to help them get into treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Just today alone had 13 phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1378)|

| 0:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| We have no one signed up for public forum and we have no first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| So nothing further said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| We are going to adjourn in a record 23 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Meeting stands adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1425)|

| 0:23:50| Whatever you do the first time, you know, just kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080102?start=1433)|
