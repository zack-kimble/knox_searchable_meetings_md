| 2:15:31| There's also administrative fees that are outlined in the admin rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| And so to your point, Councilman Testerman, about if you are a member of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| and Carter, correct me if I go off course here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| but if you're a member of the public, you snap a photo of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| this scooter was all over this ADA ramp, not cool, send it to 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| That's the photo documentation that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| not necessarily to go all the way to a citation level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| but to issue a fine against that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| And so all of those mechanisms, both informal as well as formal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| when it comes to the official citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| that $50 max that we talk about a lot with city code, that is a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| But there are also administrative fines that we have spelled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| and those are much lower thresholds in terms of when they can be invoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| And we have a lot of lateral inflexibility to impose those fines based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| documentation received, for example, from a member of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| submitted through 311, and that then is documented, listed, reported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| and ultimately invoiced to a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| Is that correct, Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| I didn't go off course there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| And then if there's a rider that is visibly violating the ride rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| I mean, so how is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| I mean, is that within KPD's purview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| Please speak to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| It's on the ground as far as enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| So through the changes to Ordinance 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| KPD would still be able to issue a citation to specific riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| However, again, we wanted to set up an alternative method of going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| and fining the company directly and having them pass on the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| That's going to be sort of like the first approach is to document it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| again, using things like place and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| The vendors are able to identify who is the one who is basically breaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| the rules and issue the fine that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| Again, that's the best practice considered for this and what we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| in a lot of other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| And so they are able to be more responsive that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| Again, though, just the way that the Ordinance 17 is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| a KPD officer could cite someone who is misusing a scooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| but that is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| something that KPD has expressed that they would like to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| So this was a way not only for us to be more responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| but to also meet the input of KPD that they would like some of the onus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| to be taken off of them when it comes to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| Okay, I'll pass on for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| I was just going to ask real quickly if Mr. Cherry could come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| Is there anything you've been – we have a national expert here in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| home, so I feel like you've heard a lot of the conversation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| Is there anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| Any clarifications you'd like to make from a bunch of folks who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| know this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| First of all, what you're dealing with is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| This is not the first time that this is – I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| this is something that a lot of cities are grappling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| and trying to find these best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| Carter mentioned that some of the elements that are in this new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| and the new management procedures are essentially the front edge of best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Councilwoman Testerman, you mentioned that you've been to cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| and you've seen this type of mobility operated in a way that is maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8335)|
| 2:19:02| little better than what we've done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| And I think this is all starting to unfold out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| and we're getting out of the Wild West of scooters, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| whereas people didn't know what they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| people didn't know how to manage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| And these sorts of situations are best practices that we've seen so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| Will they be perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| We collectively will learn how to do it better as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| In terms of there's a constant question about clutter, ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| blocked access, safety, and maybe some confounding of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| But in terms of behavior, the best thing that we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| we actually have a project right now, a national project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| where we're doing direct observations of on-road rider behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| and sidewalk behavior, parking and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| And people respond rationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| They respond to good infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| If there's parking infrastructure that's logical, that's obvious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| people park in that parking infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| But if it's ambiguous and nobody knows where they're supposed to ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| where they're supposed to park, then you get behavior that's all over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Part of that, what's in this, from what I've read recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| it covers a lot of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| No doubt there will continue to be issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| but I think there will be a lot more on par with issues that we face with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| drivers parking on sidewalks and blocking ADA ramps with their cars and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| those sorts of things that we already see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| So, yeah, those are the main points, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| In some ways, these are getting more normalized as drivers learn how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| operate around them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| So you're not hearing just like bike riders going through streets in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| downtown areas, as bicycling goes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| people learn how to drive their cars around bicyclists and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| On that note, just to follow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| has there been any studies done that measure the safety of scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| compared to bicycles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Yeah, there has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| It's a little bit tricky to compare them one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| because the nice thing about scooters is we have all sorts of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| We know exactly how many miles of scooter rides have occurred in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| Knoxville, for example, but we don't have the same data for bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| But from what we found in Nashville, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| we found that they were on par, if not safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| than bicycles in the Nashville core area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| From the epidemiology studies, the head injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| and other things that we've seen, they're kind of on the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| They're on par with what we find between bicyclists and scooter riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8509)|
| 2:21:56| A really good study came out of Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| and this is actually important to the speed limit question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| If you've ever ridden one of these in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| you'll know that they go 10 miles per hour, only 10 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| And if you ever try to ride a scooter at 10 miles an hour on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| in Washington, D.C., you find it very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| You feel like you're standing still, right, while cars are zooming by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| So almost everybody is pushed onto the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| even though it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk in the core of Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| But nonetheless, you still end up with a lot of these same sort of crash patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| that are common to bicycles as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| So if we solve those, if we solve some of the bicycle crash problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| we'll solve the scooter crash problems as well, for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| There's some unique things, but not completely different ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| Mr. Hall, I've got one follow-up question for you and for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| Just to clarify, if somebody is riding a scooter zigzag across the yellow line on Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8574)|
| 2:23:02| and the KPD officer sees them, there's going to be a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| and maybe a fine the same way as if a bicyclist or a person in a car were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| And again, KPD would have the ability to cite them at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| They're not above the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| They've got a traffic law that's just the same as everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| I have kind of been torn on these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| I rode them, ridden them a few times, and was also not so great at it the first couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8608)|
| 2:23:36| Given the number of people that use these scooters, I had no idea it was 350-something people a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8616)|
| 2:23:42| Those are 350-something cars that don't drive around the most dense area of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8622)|
| 2:23:49| So I do appreciate the upside, particularly among students who are in the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| They live in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| They use it to commute, and we don't have 350 cars a day in the middle of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| I think that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| I also appreciate that this administration, and I would say the previous administration, both have taken safety first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| I think that's the number one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| So I think given what I've heard tonight and some of the understanding of how safeties are versus perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8653)|
| 2:24:20| I think it's really important to offset that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| Here, I think we've been at this for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| In the first year, I think I heard a lot of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8668)|
| 2:24:31| I saw a lot of scooters strewn everywhere, and so second year, a little less, a little less so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| and now I feel like we're at about an equal level of complaints about scooters as I hear about bicyclists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8677)|
| 2:24:43| and mountain bikers whom I love in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| So I think to Mr. Cherry's point, I appreciate you mentioning that because it kind of connected the dots for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| about the number of complaints I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| Just generally speaking about cars speeding too fast in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| which is why we've changed the speed limit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| So I think a lot of that's been reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| The other thing is related to convenience and nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| I think without some of the changes that have happened in the past six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| which is kind of hard to differentiate between the complaints from people who saw it two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| and then they saw it a year ago, we don't separate things well in our mind over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| So I do feel like particularly the 15 corrals, the fact that these have to be re-docked every single night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8726)|
| 2:25:35| the cutoffs at 11 so people aren't out drinking and riding these any different than they are any other vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8735)|
| 2:25:43| I do think that the 311 app will help if we, again, back to communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| people know they can take a picture of one in the middle of Crooge Park and submit it on the 311 app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8749)|
| 2:25:55| The company gets fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| They can choose whether to pass that along to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| So that I think is really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| I would ask that just real estate's limited for where we can put these corrals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| and I understand that dynamic balanced with where they're convenient for people who want to use them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| so that they actually use them, but I do think some of these are in the middle of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| So particularly for Fort Sanders, I would encourage, I know that you all invited those folks to weigh in in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| but in terms of the placement of the corrals, the people that live in those neighborhoods know best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| where it would be convenient for the scooter rider but also for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8791)|
| 2:26:37| So they understand traffic flows better than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| So I would, particularly for Fort Sanders, would ask that if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| that the corral locations be vetted with those neighbors who live there and see traffic patterns every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8805)|
| 2:26:53| So I've kind of moved from extremely concerned, an immediate no a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8813)|
| 2:27:01| to I've seen some of these changes happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| I feel good about the safety as it compares to other modes of transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| and I feel pretty good about we have cadets, PBA, police officers can weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8829)|
| 2:27:19| if they see Councilwoman Parker going across the yellow line in the middle of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| But I think I feel good also about the control mechanisms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8844)|
| 2:27:32| And I think that you've given flexibility in administrative rules that we've all been able to read through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| to tighten the screws if we need to on the vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| So I think I feel pretty good about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| So I appreciate everything that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| You've done safety first the whole way, and sometimes safety first means more inconvenience for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8869)|
| 2:27:57| but I'd rather err on that side, so that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Mr. Hall, thank you for answering my questions today about safety and clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| and I really appreciate you getting back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| You know, when this pilot was first introduced and proposed to Council, I wasn't convinced this was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8895)|
| 2:28:23| I supported the pilot because I wanted to be open to being convinced that it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| And I still have some questions about it, and I appreciate everyone's questions and conversations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8909)|
| 2:28:37| I don't know if this is for Deputy Mayor Gill or Mr. Hall, but what happens if this doesn't pass tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8917)|
| 2:28:44| Do we still have the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| So the moratorium would hold until December 31st unless Council takes additional action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| The reality is that, just to be quite blunt, state law doesn't prevent us from banning them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8933)|
| 2:29:01| You could come back with an ordinance that says, nope, they're not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| Again, you've heard from us, we don't recommend that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| and therefore this is the alternative which tries to balance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| But the moratorium specifically will end December 31st pending any additional action from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| And if we didn't pass a new moratorium, then anyone could do scooters with no regulation at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| Yes, if you neither extended the moratorium nor passed a permit nor a ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8966)|
| 2:29:33| then it would go back to a little bit of that Wild West feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8973)|
| 2:29:38| I think that we do know of some tools that would keep somewhat of the rails on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| but the reality is these are transient and hard to track down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| and so when they show up, they show up and people ride them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| You are using our right-of-way as a commercial use, which is not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8990)|
| 2:29:56| but our tools for actually dealing with it become much harder to pin down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=8996)|
| 2:30:03| And then we've expanded the places where the scooters can be now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9003)|
| 2:30:10| Now during the pilot, you can't use the scooters in the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| But in this, we're expanding it to where you can use them in the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| It allows us to, when we expand the map, have the option to expand into the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| Greenways would become what's laid out in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| and administrative rules as no parking zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| Essentially, people would be able to ride their scooters on the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| but scooters cannot be deployed or rides ended on the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| Again, we don't want any scooters anywhere on greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| unless they're being ridden through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| because to meet both the connectivity issues that both Dr. Cherry and Dr. Cooley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| have laid out, but also making sure that our greenways are clutter-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| Upon passage of this ordinance, it does not mean that when it goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| scooters will automatically be allowed on greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| because they are not currently in the operating zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| It just means that it gives us the option as we expand the operating zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| to take into consideration that we can use greenways, which we currently could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| Well, and I'm glad you're clarifying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| because what I'm looking at is on page 878 of the packet, number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| It says the PMVs inside a no parking zone such as a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| with that designation may be ridden continuously through the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| However, the PMV cannot be parked, deployed, or staged in the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| So this is the same thing you and I are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9098)|
| 2:31:39| And that is where it says it is not a code violation for someone to ride on a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9099)|
| 2:31:46| but per our administrative rules, until we change that map and change the administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| there would still be a restriction from the companies such that it would be geo-fenced out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| So if you have your own scooter, if you were to adopt this ordinance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| then you could ride your personal scooter on a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| but companies could not deploy it until we change the admin rule to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| Yeah, to that point, which is a good one that Deputy Mayor Gill made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| that is GPS enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| That is not something that we would have to retroactively enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| So that is something where technology is good enough to abide by a no parking zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| That's something before we even put this in there, I went to various vendors and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| hey, is technology good enough to do something like this for us to require it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| And they not only said, yes, our technology is good enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| but we think that this is a really good idea because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| them too want them to be able to be used on greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| but they do not want them to be cluttering greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| They know that that's a bad look for them as well as we don't want that as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| and our citizens don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| So that is a GPS enforced rule that we're able to have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9168)|
| 2:32:54| And also on the private, this change also, interestingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| affects privately operated electric scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| We, looking at it, it appears that with state law and our Ordinance 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| if you privately own an electric scooter, it's relatively free reign on our greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| and this would restrict those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| So we're not only, we are allowing shared mobility vehicles on our greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| but we're also making, writing in the case to where privately owned electric vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| cannot be parked on a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| They can still be ridden on them, but they can't be parked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| even if you privately own them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| Well, and I guess that brings up the other issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| the last part of this provision on that page on number 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| was about you can't park or deploy them or stage them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| which I totally understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| But it's a much different thing for this company or these companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| to come and pick these up in the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| when they may not be very close to a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| so they're going to have to, you know, have some mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| for getting, you know, through the greenway to collect these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| if they are strewn about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| I mean, can you talk a little bit about what your thoughts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| on how that can be accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| So because no scooters would be deployed or rides ended on a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| there would be no need for vendors to go and collect them on the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| because there would not be a situation where a scooter would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| standing alone by itself on a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| They could be outside of the greenway where a vendor could access them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| through a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| Council Member Berger, if I could just clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| like when you ride, you have to use your app to end the ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| and they could just set it up so you can't end the ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| and your credit card will keep getting billed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| If you're on a greenway, you can't end the ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| so it's in the rider's best interest to go to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| where you're legally allowed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| So there is the technology already there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| So if I, I mean, obviously I can stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| I haven't ridden a scooter, so I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| But you have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| You could stop, but it would get pretty expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| I can stop, but I'm still getting charged until I decide to end the trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| and you're saying I can't end the trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| unless I want to have an ongoing credit card bill forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| because I left it in the middle of the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| I mean, it's still, I still struggle with the expansion into the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| and I understand that's a possibility, not a definite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| I mean, we just talked about the speed limit on these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| is 20 miles an hour max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| We just lowered the speed limit down to 25 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| going into effect in July if we pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| So that speed just, and I get what you're saying about it's on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| and if it's going too slow with traffic, that's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| but it also seems to me like it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| you're really putting yourself in a bad situation safety-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| And, you know, people are encouraged but not required to wear helmets, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| They are encouraged but not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9349)|
| 2:35:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| I would say on the point, this ordinance and administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| also allows us to lower the speed limit in certain zones if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| So we could say on a greenway that if you're on a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| the maximum speed limit is 20 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| but if you're on a greenway it would be lowered to, say, 15 or 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| if we wanted it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| That technology is certainly there for vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| and this ordinance and administrative rules would allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| to implement those requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| And then last question is we're increasing the number of scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9378)|
| 2:36:24| than are currently allowed in the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| Yes, by 50 per vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| Okay, which is 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| So there's going to be 100 more scooters if this was to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| than there would be before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| There would be 100 more scooters, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| they would be more dispersed throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| due to both the industry parking model creating a cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| on downtown Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9406)|
| 2:36:47| which is where the vast majority of devices are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| and also with things like the ordinance allowing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| to establish equity zones that would require scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| to be deployed in certain areas of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| to make sure they're being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| So, yes, there would be 100 more devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| but they'd be much more spread out across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9423)|
| 2:37:04| And the other thing I just wanted to mention was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| I recognize and totally appreciate all the work that's gone into this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| and the biggest thing I really appreciate that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| is the slow approach to it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| It wasn't, you know, let's kind of slowly get somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| So I definitely appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| and all the work that's been done on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| You know, I think I would agree that at the beginning of the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| I was hearing a lot more about clutter than I maybe am now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9450)|
| 2:37:35| but I still hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| And then, you know, sort of like some of the other council members have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| most of what I hear is not positive about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| But I know that there are people who use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| because you just told me there's, would you say, 300,000 riders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| Is that a year or throughout the course of the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| That's what we would estimate during the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| But that does also factor in the fact that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9478)|
| 2:38:02| during their busy season of 2020, obviously COVID happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| we had ceased operations on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| So there is a big chunk of when we would have had a lot more rides happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| that aren't factored into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| But, again, 130,000 is what we're experiencing in a normal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| that we're seeing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| Again, during the busier months, which are spring through fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| so the majority of the year, it's about 500 rides a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| Okay. And I also see the positives, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| with the potential reduction in the number of car trips that are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| and from a sustainability access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| So there's a lot of really positive things in here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| I'm just not, I don't know if I'm there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| I'll let my colleagues ask some questions, and maybe I'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| Okay. I'm not sure who was first on these lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9530)|
| 2:38:55| I'll start with Ms. Parker, Ms. Fugate, and then Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| I'm not sure who had their light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| What is the expiration date on the permit, the $12,000 permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9546)|
| 2:39:07| It's a two-year permit, 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| And in the equity zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| will there be infrastructure for the scooters in those zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9554)|
| 2:39:20| There could be, but not definitionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| So an equity zone, as it exists, again, definitionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| is really catered towards making sure that devices are being deployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| in a certain area that might be traditionally underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| It does not necessarily mean that infrastructure would be built out in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| but that is something that we could work with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| and Mark Elliott and his team on doing if, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| trying to meet the point where they make sense from a management standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| But they certainly could in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| That's one of my concerns with the 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| I'm even a little confused about the selection of the 15 locations for the carousel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| because I thought during the pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| there was a limit on where you could take the scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| And so that was, you know, close in to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9610)|
| 2:40:15| And so I can't imagine that we would have had a lot of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| or a lot of scooter activity outside of those areas close to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| But now that we're moving into those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| I'm afraid that downtown is going to get the infrastructure outline areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9629)|
| 2:40:34| become the wild, wild west for the scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| How do we prevent that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| So I think that the, again, a lot of the areas that I think would already be primed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| for things like equity zones are already within the operating area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| But to get to the point, I think because downtown specifically faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| so much sidewalk traffic as compared to other parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| that's why we've seen such higher complaints and why we focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| Again, 15 carousels is the starting point, not the end point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| And we would definitely look at expanding the infrastructure that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| This is sort of the immediate, hey, this is where most of the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| Here's the solution that we think would work not only for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| but we've seen work in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| Here's what we think we should implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| As we continue to expand, we would certainly consider expanding where those carousels are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| And, again, this ordinance gives us the opportunity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| that we don't currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| I do think it's important, though, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| for the implementation plan to be equitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| that the infrastructure has to accompany the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| Otherwise, you know, we'll get complaints, complaints, complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| until we decide to then put infrastructure in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| We can learn the lessons from this pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| And as we expand, implement those solutions along the way, but not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9714)|
| 2:42:02| I wouldn't deploy scooters into a new area that didn't have the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| for them to have a home when folks are not using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| And what we've seen is areas where the operating area does serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| again, that are not downtown in Fort Sanders, like North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| South Knoxville, and East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| we have not seen near the amount of issues that we have in downtown Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| So we do think that based on NACTO guidelines for sidewalk deployment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| which is how those areas would continue to be served, based on the NACTO standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9750)|
| 2:42:36| the infrastructure is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| But if we reach a point where it no longer can serve those devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| we absolutely have the flexibility to put in infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| and, because of the administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| raise the price of the operating permit to meet that additional cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9769)|
| 2:42:55| My other concern is about competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| and concern that this is limiting the operators to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| Is there a time limit on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| Is this like another quasi-pilot program where that will come back to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| in the next two years to expand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| so more companies can compete for that permit to operate here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| The reason why we've continued with two operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| is not only because we think that that is a manageable fleet size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| and an appropriate fleet size for our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| There's also an administrative point on this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| where, as the person who works closely with the vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| I talk with them at least each vendor at least once every two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| to check in and see how things are going and give policy recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| let them know if the areas need addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| And if we expand the amount of operators that we administratively have to wrangle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| and deal with potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| especially as we're trying to really ramp up potential enforcement on operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| two is a good manageable size for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| When we've talked with other experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| they agree that two makes a lot of sense for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| Even vendors themselves think that two make a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| for a city the size of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| That's what similar-sized cities work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| So I would not see us wanting more vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9850)|
| 2:44:14| but because it's on a two-year permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| that gives us an opportunity every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| to potentially hear competitive bits from other operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| and change who our operators are every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| Or if a permit is revoked or lapses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| if someone pulls out of Knoxville as a market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| this ordinance and administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| allows us to fill and readmiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9876)|
| 2:44:39| to a different permit to a different vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| But this would signing of approving this ordinance tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9882)|
| 2:44:50| would commit us to two companies for at least two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9890)|
| 2:44:57| At least two companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| Well, the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9900)|
| 2:45:01| we're not necessarily committed to anything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| Again, we can revoke a permit at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| We also have the ability, if we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| to just deploy one permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| It would limit us to two permits for a maximum of two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| but it does not necessarily commit us to those as minimums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| I was going to say, as we heard earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| somewhere it takes five votes to change an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| So yes, it is locking us in by ordinance up to two permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9924)|
| 2:45:31| I won't speak for future council decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| about how that might change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| but it is by ordinance spelling out that limit of two companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9934)|
| 2:45:39| And the reason I ask is because the market may shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| Well, I won't speak for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| but I know I'm very interested in seeing more e-bike availability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| and I understand it's not as profitable as scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9951)|
| 2:45:54| but that can shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| And so I'm trying to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| if we're making a commitment to companies for two years tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| that would limit our ability to have more than 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| 100 e-bikes on the road and potentially receive bids from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| companies who would be able to bring more e-bikes to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9975)|
| 2:46:19| I just wanted to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| this commits us to at least a two-year commitment of this 600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9981)|
| 2:46:30| scooter program with 100 potential additional e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9990)|
| 2:46:36| I think it could be bikes or e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| Bikes or e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10000)|
| 2:46:41| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| it would take a council decision to increase that if, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| we had a bike vendor who said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| we want to come and bring shared bikes and just shared bikes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| it would require a council decision to change that to allow us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| issue additional operating permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| However, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| that is pretty unlikely considering the current state of play with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| but that would take a council decision to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| to raise the amount of operating permits that we could give out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10033)|
| 2:47:14| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| I obviously understand that city council can change it with a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10036)|
| 2:47:20| but what I'm trying to understand is what commitments and negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10040)|
| 2:47:25| have taken place between the city and these two vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| That's what I'm trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| Just the last point I have is I do have concerns about having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10052)|
| 2:47:39| primarily complaint-driven process for any new service or community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10059)|
| 2:47:52| asset, anything really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| because it creates the potential for increasing conflict in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10076)|
| 2:48:02| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| I like the recommendations that came from Councilwoman Testerman about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| how other cities have handled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| And the more we can rely on technology on the front end to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| prevent some of the potential violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| I think the better the deployment and the implementation of these into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| our city would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| I don't think if we pass this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| that would prevent us from continuing to explore with companies ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| that we can lean on technology to prevent some of these potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| violations and not rely solely on a complaint-driven system that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| can create too much conflict in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| I think that this, again, does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| there are a lot of what's worked into here have been to get at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| to get at those issues on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| whether it's the industry parking zone or things like the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| zones that can be controlled through GPS and geofence technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| So there, I know that we have talked a lot about enforcement, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10150)|
| 2:49:13| there are a lot of things in here that are related specifically to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| tackling those things on the front end so that we don't need to rely so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| heavily on enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| Council Member Parker, Council Member Huguet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| Just, I appreciate what Councilwoman Parker was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| about complaint driven, because it sounds to me like, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10172)|
| 2:49:38| we can only do so much with the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| but if people see somebody doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10180)|
| 2:49:43| we've talked about taking a photo, 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| so that's a complaint-driven sort of system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| I want to be clear that I understand we will fine the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10189)|
| 2:49:56| They contractually have to pay us the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| and then they can go after their consumer or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| I just want to make sure that the pain is on the company to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| that their riders do what they're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| and my assumption would be that if they have a problem rider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| they will cease to allow that person to be a customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10222)|
| 2:50:23| Again, I would say if there is an immediate infraction or something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| is a danger that needs to be stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| there are tools in here for someone like APD, but yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| the majority of the time how it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10232)|
| 2:50:33| But I mean, I keep hearing this, you know, who's actually going to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| We don't care if they chase down the person who broke the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| We're getting our money from the vendor to incentivize them to chase down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| the person and correct the bad behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| That's what I understand about the way this is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| My next question is we talk a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| I appreciate what Councilman Roberto said about on the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10260)|
| 2:51:05| because I've got a feeling there will be a lot of people that don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| these on the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| If you're a walker and a scooter's whizzing by at 20 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10269)|
| 2:51:14| I think we definitely need to look at if it hits a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10274)|
| 2:51:19| does it automatically get reduced so that it's not going 20 miles an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| Is the maximum speed the minute you're on a greenway 5 or 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| or something so that walkers and joggers and parents with strollers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10288)|
| 2:51:35| don't want people whizzing by them 20 miles an hour on a scooter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| I'm just raising this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| I'm trying to get there to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| but these are things that I'm hearing that I have concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| And also, as we expand, I do hope we'll talk to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| because some of them may not want them in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| And so I don't think there's any real clear way of how it gets decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10318)|
| 2:52:05| where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| I think this ordinance and administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| especially the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| gives us a lot of flexibility when it comes to addressing these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| We are able to do things like implement the speed caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| It allows us to allow scooters on greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| but does not commit us to having scooters on greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| That's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| something that we would want to have stakeholder conversations with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| or whether it's expanding it to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| It would just allow us to do that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| And, again, this being something that you all as council can vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| that's not just another moratorium extension like you have been voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| We won't vote on the speed limits if it's an administrative rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| But you all have the opportunity to vote now to allow us to be flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| and responsive to implement that in a quick manner after consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| And so I guess what I'm saying is I just think I want to voice these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10377)|
| 2:53:04| because I think intellectually I understand that you will engage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| I just want a public commitment that administratively neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10389)|
| 2:53:15| communities will be engaged as we look to move them out into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10395)|
| 2:53:21| because I think that's like the traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| That's some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10405)|
| 2:53:26| Neighborhoods have concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10409)|
| 2:53:30| That's something that we are committed to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| Thank you, Council Member Fugate, Council Member Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| and then Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10419)|
| 2:53:40| Some of my questions got asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| Mr. Hall, what has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| and what are the protocol or the plans for sharing complaints, concerns with vendors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10427)|
| 2:53:54| So we're getting complaints through 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| You said about one per week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| I get them on average one or two per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| How are they shared with the vendors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| Like you get it, you pass it on immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| Are there some like monthly, quarterly check-ins like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| hey, it looks like we got an issue here or there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| If there's currently, if there's an issue with a scooter being mis-parked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| or mis-ridden and I'm made aware of it through 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| I'm the contact person for 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| I will immediately email the vendors and let them know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| and we have not had an incident where they were not able to fix the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| within the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| Just one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| I'm not going to harp on the helmets thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| I just can't fathom getting on these without a helmet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| I've been to a funeral for a young father who died by falling off a scooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| so if you don't think that that's not sad, it was sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| And it wasn't an e-scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| So anyway, I'm just, head injuries are very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10493)|
| 2:54:59| So it looks like in Chicago they do some incentive programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10499)|
| 2:55:06| The vendors are doing incentive programs for helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10506)|
| 2:55:10| Like during the pilot, they were giving out free helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| And I felt the same way when we had the pace bikes too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| I mean, they just, they need helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| People need helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| The Bird and Lime implemented an incentive program such as the helmet selfie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10520)|
| 2:55:25| to encourage helmet wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10525)|
| 2:55:26| Riders can take a selfie and get, I guess, ride credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| So that's as far as it goes in Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| And then apparently Miami banned scooters and then just brought them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| just this week or last week voted to get rid of the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| I'm guessing you're aware of this and you follow all this maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| But they are requiring helmets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| and I guess the scooter won't operate unless they're wearing a helmet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| So was this any part of our conversation when we were looking at these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10550)|
| 2:55:57| When it came to helmets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| I will also plug helmets are available for rent for free from Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| But not necessarily anywhere near the corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10570)|
| 2:56:11| Through the RFP application is currently complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10571)|
| 2:56:15| We do have, I believe, two different questions in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| about how they would incentivize helmet use and helmet safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| So that is something that we would, when we are giving out these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| do these competitive bid processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| we would be talking with vendors about how they are incentivizing helmet use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| We are not requiring them, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| because we think that that would be a barrier to people using them for mobility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| and a convenience factor with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| Factoring in, I think that if we were to have a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| if we were seeing higher problems with deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| we have not had a death in Knoxville over the entire course of the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10605)|
| 2:56:49| We have not had a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| None of the reports that were given to us resulted in a head injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| So I think that we have not seen that as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| Helmets have not been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| there has not been a case yet where a helmet would have protected somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| where otherwise, or where a helmet would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| That you're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| But again, we, that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| helmets are something that we have taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| through the competitive bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Companies would be awarded by showing that they have incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| for proper helmet use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| It is in the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| So that is in there to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| you get X number of extra scooters or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10647)|
| 2:57:31| if you incentivize helmet use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| It is in there for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| they are more likely to be given an operating permit if they incentivize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10656)|
| 2:57:41| They're awarded points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10661)|
| 2:57:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10662)|
| 2:57:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| Two different times in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| Ms. Mary McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| Mr. Howell, first, thank you for standing there for over an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| answering our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| First, I'll say that in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10676)|
| 2:57:59| I did see more complaints about scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| I think now more people have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| either there's better behavior or people are starting to get used to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| I want to be clear that there are no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| I've received no request in my district whatsoever for scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10689)|
| 2:58:13| And so if we're talking about expanding scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| and I think it's to Councilmember Parker's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| that may start, we may start hearing more complaints about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| And so if we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10701)|
| 2:58:22| we'll definitely be coming back if this is passed to have those addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| and maybe rethink that area if there are a lot of complaints there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| I also want to be clear that grown folks don't ride scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| I've been on the scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| I don't like them either, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| But young people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| And I think that we see our younger demographic of people riding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| And I think that, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| the behavior has been not very belligerent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| I think that they've been compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| I'm not sure, you know, as far as enforcing helmets or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| But I do have concerns about the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| because I do agree that greenways are more family friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10735)|
| 2:58:58| and people who are not on there necessarily for speed are going 20 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10743)|
| 2:59:04| So if there is a decision made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| and it sounds like that decision is within your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| is that correct, if this is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| But it would be in, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| collaboration with the working group that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| And, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| we work with our Greenway Commission and Parks and Recreation to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10756)|
| 2:59:20| that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| It's something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| this is a decision that is allowing electric bikes and electric scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10762)|
| 2:59:28| on greenways is something that has relative expert consensus on it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10768)|
| 2:59:32| a good thing for cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| Again, you heard from Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10779)|
| 2:59:40| Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10780)|
| 2:59:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10781)|
| 2:59:42| Michael Knoxville supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| Oh, Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10784)|
| 2:59:45| We have that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10788)|
| 2:59:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10789)|
| 2:59:50| Is it possible, if this were to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10790)|
| 2:59:51| that if the decision is made by that group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| that council is made aware of that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| And I would be happy, as we talked about expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| particularly in your districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| if somebody has one of you as council members has questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| I'm happy to answer it or reach out to you directly to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10814)|
| 3:00:15| So to follow up on what Council Member Fugate said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| So if the vendor is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| those dollars come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10823)|
| 3:00:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10824)|
| 3:00:25| And then we get the two-year contract agreement of the 12,000 plus 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10825)|
| 3:00:30| bonds, 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| So 8,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| Do we get any other percentage of fees, user rider fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| We decided not to go that route, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| to make it to have a smooth administrative burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| We also have a pretty predictive model of how much this program is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| to cost us on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| and that's what the permitting fee is based off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| We do have the option to increase the permitting fee if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10850)|
| 3:00:54| But knowing that seasons and markets can be flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| we didn't want to have to rely on rides or deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| or ride fee shares to collect back dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| So having a flat fee that we could rely on income for is the way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| decided to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10875)|
| 3:01:16| So the last thing I will say is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| part of me is like why do we have an ordinance if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10879)|
| 3:01:22| law enforcement isn't going to be charged with enforcing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10882)|
| 3:01:26| Sorry, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| But, you know, being given merely the option to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10888)|
| 3:01:33| And, you know, so to me that results in no consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10893)|
| 3:01:38| which, you know, makes me wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| why do we put an ordinance forth to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| So, you know, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| any ordinance has got to be enacted consistently and fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10905)|
| 3:01:49| or it undermines its validity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| I mean, it just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10912)|
| 3:01:54| why do we do it if we're not really going to enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| And, you know, the vendor's out of sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| therefore they're not as invested other than economically as much in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10920)|
| 3:02:05| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| And, you know, so in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| we've got to have the will to ensure we're upholding the law to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| safety and responsible use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| You know, as I said, I really want to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| I think it's got a lot of benefits and upsides to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| You know, I'm hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| That said, we've got a multi-use stadium coming to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| I see it, you know, this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| a great asset and for, you know, what's coming down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| And I would say if you pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| I didn't see a corral at World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| and given we have a new hotel getting ready to open there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| and it's also kind of our city's event center, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| I would just throw that out there as one location that I could see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10968)|
| 3:02:53| So at any rate, I go back to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| I go back to, you know, having an ordinance that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10977)|
| 3:03:01| we need to have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10981)|
| 3:03:02| but we need to have the stomach and the will to be able to enforce all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| of our ordinances, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| So thank you for, again, all your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10995)|
| 3:03:16| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| With regard to the greenways, if passed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| the ordinance would change which would allow scooters in the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11002)|
| 3:03:28| but it would be an administrative decision as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| or not you would allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| It would be allowed by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| but you as the administration would make a decision about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| or not to expand use into the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| That would be under our purview through the administrative rules, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11024)|
| 3:03:45| And also with regard to reducing the speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11025)|
| 3:03:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11029)|
| 3:03:50| And so the option for council to voice, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11030)|
| 3:03:55| a position on expansion of the greenways with a vote is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11035)|
| 3:04:00| Well, Council Member Roberto, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| I pledged as the mayor of this administration that we would not expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| until we talked to the Greenways Commission and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| you gave a great point that this whole process starting with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| previous administration and continuing to now has been very slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11056)|
| 3:04:19| very deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| When this came before my eyes over the summer, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| we have to deal with safety, nuisance, clutter, equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| and working with our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| I mean, to me it makes a really big difference that an expert in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11071)|
| 3:04:35| engineering and traffic and mobility has said this is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| It makes a really big difference that our council on disability issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| has said this is a good plan that bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| walk Knoxville has said this is a good plan that we need to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11085)|
| 3:04:49| seek input from neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| We've had surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| We've had public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| particularly in the neighborhood that's most affected by the nuisances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| which is downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11097)|
| 3:04:58| That's where we had our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| And so I agree with agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| We need to keep going slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| And I certainly pledged that if this is approved on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| tonight, you know, and approved in two weeks later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| that we would continue to move that way with all, with safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| being the number one concern always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| Well, and I appreciate that, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| I definitely hear what you're saying and I appreciate all the work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| I just really struggled with supporting it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| because I really have a hard time with the green ways piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11128)|
| 3:05:33| So I don't know that I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| I don't know that I can support it this time because the green ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| This has been a great and lengthy discussion to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| Just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11145)|
| 3:05:46| I wouldn't have brought this before you if I hadn't carefully considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11149)|
| 3:05:50| I've personally had fun riding scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| I've also had a fall on a scooter that made me not want to ride them so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| much, but I appreciate vice mayor McKenzie's awareness that we represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| all the people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| including younger people who are the most frequent riders of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| And most of whom are following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11167)|
| 3:06:10| I've gotten a lot fewer complaints about it in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11170)|
| 3:06:13| Now that we have the corrals, now that we have the better technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| So I feel like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| I brought this to you because we have basically three options, regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| ban and the wild west and wild west is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| We're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| Banning has some downsides and regulating has a lot of upsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| We're focused on safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| We're focused on the best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| We're focused on community buy-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| So I hope you'll support this on first reading tonight and we can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| the discussion in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| If you do any further questions or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11206)|
| 3:06:51| Seeing that all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11214)|

| 3:11:20| When we go out and meet a prospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| Myself and my sales team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| And we don't get the job because we're too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| Then drive out to the house or pass the house a couple of weeks down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11491)|

| 3:11:46| All have consequences for not complying with regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| The city of Knoxville currently has no way of regulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11509)|

| 3:12:54| Again, I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| Next person signed up to speak on this is Charles Beatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11578)|
| 3:13:03| You can start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11583)|
| 3:13:10| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11590)|
| 3:13:11| My name is Charles Beatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| I live at 2418 Mine Road in Mascot, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| I am the owner and operator of Knox Tree Care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| I do operate here in the city of Knoxville and surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11599)|
| 3:13:23| Mostly what I'm going to provide for you guys is a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11603)|
| 3:13:27| Similar to Nick's as far as in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11607)|
| 3:13:30| But my company is much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| Which generally is going to be the category of company that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| taking advantage of dumping debris on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11615)|
| 3:13:40| Sort of in the general idea anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| And my perspective for you guys is that it is not a prohibition to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11622)|
| 3:13:48| ability to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11628)|
| 3:13:49| To take care of the debris that we cut and haul it off as is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11629)|
| 3:13:54| So I'm very much in support of giving the urban forestry program and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11634)|
| 3:14:00| city as a whole a bit more teeth to ensure that people who are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11640)|
| 3:14:05| business in our field of tree service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| or forestry, or whatever you want to call it, are able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| are going in there and they actually are responsibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| basically cleaning up after themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| And not passing that mess on to the city or passing the mess on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| someone that's not them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| There are hypothetically competitive reasons that they might do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11662)|
| 3:14:27| But I believe that a very simple conversation with the homeowner can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| quickly alleviate a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| And frankly, we have pretty cost-effective solutions for green waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| disposal, living earth, and other options in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| So I don't think that there are any really strong arguments for even a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| small operator to say that this would inhibit their ability to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11686)|
| 3:14:52| Thank you, Mr. Beatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| Okay, that concludes people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| Are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11700)|
| 3:15:01| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11703)|
| 3:15:06| Actually, questions came to mind after listening to the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| because my reading of the ordinance was that this would not apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11711)|
| 3:15:24| properties containing a single-family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11724)|
| 3:15:30| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| Casey Krause, if you could come and answer these particular questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11733)|
| 3:15:37| we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| Casey Krause, urban forester with the city of Knoxville, 4909 Shannon Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| So your question was about the clause about residential property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11744)|
| 3:15:48| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| Yeah, so the part about the brush would still apply to residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11749)|
| 3:15:57| So clearing the brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| Yeah, so essentially if a contractor were doing business on a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| property, they would still be required to remove brush on residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11764)|
| 3:16:08| property that they create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| That's for higher business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| But they do not have to, if they're working on a residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| they don't have to register with the city, with the urban forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11778)|
| 3:16:24| All contractors doing tree work within the city of Knoxville would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| Oh, I have major concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| I live in Hoston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| I've had a lot of tree work done at my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11795)|
| 3:16:40| I've gotten a lot of estimates on the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11800)|
| 3:16:45| And, you know, the folks who generally did the work, I went to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11805)|
| 3:16:51| University of Tennessee and have a lot of friends who were in forestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| so I can call up friends to come and help with things at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11814)|
| 3:17:01| They're not registered with the city, and they wouldn't be registered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11821)|
| 3:17:06| with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| And because of that, I was able to pay $1,000 rather than $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11827)|
| 3:17:12| And that's a serious quote difference of what I paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11832)|
| 3:17:17| I'm concerned about how many people would be out of work if we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11837)|
| 3:17:25| this because of how many companies do yard work, which includes doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11845)|
| 3:17:31| some tree work, who would not fit into these qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11851)|
| 3:17:37| And, you know, to expound upon that, a lot of these people that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11857)|
| 3:17:42| talking about are people of color, brown people, black people, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| charge a lot less than the big companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| I don't even think I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11869)|
| 3:17:54| I'm just concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11874)|
| 3:17:56| I will state that within the clause, this does apply to tree work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11876)|
| 3:18:01| over 12 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| And at that point, you are talking about some significant resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| that are needed in order to do that type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11888)|
| 3:18:11| So if the tree is under 12 inches in diameter at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11891)|
| 3:18:15| you're talking lawn care companies, commercial, that may be more along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11895)|
| 3:18:21| the lines of horticulture work, stuff like that may not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11901)|
| 3:18:24| need to register at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| I know folks are ready to get out of here, so I don't expect there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| to be discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11912)|
| 3:18:33| And I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| I think it's important that we have a residential tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| excuse me, brush collection program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| It is not designed for materials that you are generally going to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11920)|
| 3:18:45| and pay to have those services done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| And so I think Mr. Krause's clarification, that 12-inch diameter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11928)|
| 3:18:52| you start getting above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| Number one, it's dangerous for the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| So if they're not properly trained and have insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| workman's comp, those types of things, it's really dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11938)|
| 3:19:01| So most of, I think, what you're talking about is going to be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| just because that's a lawn care company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| It's somebody that comes out and does some minor trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| If you're having significant tree work done, that is where these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11949)|
| 3:19:14| small or large companies with the skill set, the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11954)|
| 3:19:17| and the experience for both the workers and the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11957)|
| 3:19:22| is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11962)|
| 3:19:23| And that's really, I think, Mr. Krause, what this program is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11963)|
| 3:19:26| and why we have a large business and a small business, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| that employ a lot of people as well, to make sure that everybody's safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11969)|
| 3:19:33| and our program is not subsidizing individuals who maybe don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11973)|
| 3:19:39| the right credentials and experience and insurance to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11986)|
| 3:19:53| Okay, seeing no more questions or comments, all those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11995)|
| 3:19:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11996)|
| 3:19:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11997)|
| 3:19:58| I'll abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11998)|
| 3:19:59| Motion carries 8-0 with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12002)|
| 3:20:03| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12003)|
| 3:20:04| I'm sorry, Vice Mayor McKenzie had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| Okay, next item is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| We have four people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12010)|
| 3:20:13| First is John Zieda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12013)|
| 3:20:20| Are you here, Mr. Zieda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12020)|
| 3:20:23| Okay, moving right along, Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12023)|
| 3:20:29| Ms. Sparks, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| Okay, next is Greg Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| Mr. Ducey, you know what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12034)|
| 3:20:40| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| Greg Ducey, 3825 Debonair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12043)|
| 3:20:48| Last time I was here, I talked about the treacherous Hillwood Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12048)|
| 3:20:53| in South Knoxville where it goes down and intersects with South Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12053)|
| 3:20:58| That's in Councilperson Smith's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12058)|
| 3:21:06| It's still on my radar, so I'm going to move on and come back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12066)|
| 3:21:10| maybe another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| Also on my radar are the cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| I saw a recent article online yesterday talking about Mars Hill Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12077)|
| 3:21:23| If you haven't read it, it was very, very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12083)|
| 3:21:27| I'm suggesting maybe we should have a cemetery workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| There's other cemeteries besides the ones on Richmond Hill and Keith over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12091)|
| 3:21:36| in the Westview neighborhood that I began working on two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12096)|
| 3:21:42| I think we owe it to the people who can't speak for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12102)|
| 3:21:47| and we owe it to our neighborhoods to try to make some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| on those cemeteries like we did on Magnolia over the last couple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12111)|
| 3:21:57| at those cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| I wanted to send a shout-out to Tommy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| I know Wednesday nights aren't so good with church and everything going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12128)|
| 3:22:14| Other people work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| Two weeks ago Tommy brought his two boys down to the lost sheep ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12136)|
| 3:22:22| I think they had a pretty good time, got to meet some of the homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12142)|
| 3:22:26| They appreciated meeting you as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12146)|
| 3:22:29| and I look forward to other city council folks coming down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12149)|
| 3:22:35| and meeting our homeless and getting a better perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| besides what we see on the news or what we see on the on- and off-ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12159)|
| 3:22:44| where they're asking for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12164)|
| 3:22:47| I think we can also learn from other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12167)|
| 3:22:50| Someone brought it to my attention how Nashville does a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| with their homeless, so I'm doing a little research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12174)|
| 3:22:58| Another thing I'm doing some research on is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12178)|
| 3:23:02| Generally we get up here, we say things, there's no interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12182)|
| 3:23:07| Probably some people wonder if they're heard or not or if anybody cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12187)|
| 3:23:11| It's been a long night for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12191)|
| 3:23:15| So I don't want to say much on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| but I've been investigating what other cities do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| and maybe how our public forum could be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12201)|
| 3:23:26| I wanted to give a shout-out to the chief, police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12206)|
| 3:23:32| There's been a lot of good work going on over on the Alcoa Highway Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| Today I talked to Officer Pittinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12216)|
| 3:23:40| I've talked to a few other officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12220)|
| 3:23:42| You all were running radar over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| Kudos to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12224)|
| 3:23:45| It's a 40 zone, very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| I also saw two officers over on the Montlake overpass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12228)|
| 3:23:52| and on the Mount Vernon overpass that were there for safety reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12232)|
| 3:23:56| as they're relining and re-signing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| So thank you for the service to that finger annexation district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12239)|
| 3:24:05| which is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12245)|
| 3:24:06| It's also in Councilman Smith's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| I brought up about three, four months ago a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12251)|
| 3:24:17| for beautification and for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| Chad left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12260)|

| 3:24:23| Thank you for the wonderful work over on Alcoa Highway cleaning that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12263)|
| 3:24:28| And I'm looking forward to working maybe with Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12268)|
| 3:24:32| and some of the other council members on an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12272)|
| 3:24:37| I think it would be a wonderful idea if we had a welcome to Knoxville sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12277)|
| 3:24:42| put somewhere on that northbound east side of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12282)|
| 3:24:47| We've cleared it out now, and once we come over the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12287)|
| 3:24:52| and we see our beautiful city, we have so many people coming to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12292)|
| 3:24:57| from the airport through Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| We spend a lot of money on a lot of things in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| and for the most part I support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12303)|
| 3:25:06| I would love to see a welcome to Knoxville sign put in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| Just a suggestion, I'm always looking for things to improve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12311)|
| 3:25:16| I try to compliment the good things we do here in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12316)|
| 3:25:22| It doesn't happen without a lot of hard work from the folks up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12322)|
| 3:25:27| And finally, 311, I hope people utilize 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12327)|

| 3:25:38| Somehow it got lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| Mayor, I hope that you compliment Shawana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12340)|

| 3:25:48| She's polite and she's patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211130?start=12348)|
