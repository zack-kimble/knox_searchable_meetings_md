| 2:21:42| There may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| unanticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| but there are serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| problems and they do not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| unnoticed by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| They will have an incredible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| And it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| It has to do in part where they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| substituted new zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| for other zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| that are in the present zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| and have done so inappropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| which is going to cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| I would ask you to direct those to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| Peter or Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| and make sure they are aware of the flaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| and I'm sure she is doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| Mr. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| follow up on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| Councilperson Ryder and Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| I think at some point we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| have a final document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| I mean, I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| untold numbers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| marks in here to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| I had suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| at this meeting that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| identify articles that we're going to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| We cover those articles and then we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| on knowing that they're intermingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| Today we've jumped from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| all over the place and we haven't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| talked about any of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| that are in Article 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| We have to give time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| to talk about each of these articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| We have to have a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| document because I'm sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| messages to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Mr. Green and letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| him know, hey, I see these errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| and he's making changes to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| that maybe you don't know he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| Maybe there's something you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| in there and maybe there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| Most of the stuff that he and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| talking about so far has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| really about spelling errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| or a word out of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| or something like that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| not so much policy like we're supposed to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| about today. But I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| question that's coming up from these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| Councilmembers is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| should we wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| to have workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| until we have a final document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| that then we mark up and we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| from there. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| what I was hearing from other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| would ask my colleagues that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| McKenzie. I would definitely agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| because at this point we're giving some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| recommendations. There's a lot of additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| to me it's a little counterproductive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| if we are not working off of the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| draft document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| Also, I'd like to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| for consideration for my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| is that if we're going to get that final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| document on the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| the 20th is not giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| us enough time to properly review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| I would also remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| that we're dealing with residential that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| and according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| Mr. Green, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| won't change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| If there's going to be some substantial change in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| we may have to postpone that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| there will be some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| that are related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| setbacks and lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| in a couple of districts. But policy-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| Policy-wise no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| I'm just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| echo Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| and Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| McKenzie's sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| I have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| immersed myself in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| to the level of some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| constituents up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| because whenever I started to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| it was always morphing and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| And with all the other things that we're juggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| it's like, okay, we'll wait until we get the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| because every time I found myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| asking about something it was moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| I think we really need to follow it intensely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| from this point, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| when we sit here and have this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| like, that change is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| that change is coming, it's up to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| to make sure the change actually happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| and got in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| If we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| we're the ones that are putting our neck out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| and voting for whether the change made it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| I've got to go back through and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| the period's got taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| care of and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| one spot where it's this got changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| no rush to rush through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| with all the T's that we have to cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| and the I's we have to dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| I know Mr. Frost would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| I definitely hear what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| council is saying, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| it's just that this whole, it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| ungainly process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| I understand the intent of the process, but you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Mr. Green and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| Aarons, which are trying, they're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| take in input from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| various people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| whether it's council, members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| of the public, the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| or things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| and I don't think they probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| really want to tell somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| no, that we can't listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| to you anymore. They want to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| to, I mean, they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| some finality too, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| hard to tell people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| well, we can't listen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| you and you might have a good idea, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| I mean, I'm not speaking for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| but, you know, they're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| council's in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| Mr. Aarons, Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| are in the middle and the public's in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| on the situation, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| you know, I also understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| their situation too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| Councilwoman McKenzie. So let me interject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| and I'm going to respectfully disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| I know that there have been cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| off dates previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| for input, online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| input. At this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| MPC has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| still tweaking some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| from input that you've already gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| and some feedback that you're hearing from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| but we have to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| final document that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| as a council can work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| At this point, MPC has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| now passed this response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| and I am of the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| because we are making some decisions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| going to affect property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| and what they can and cannot do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| for the next 50 plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| I do think that it would be disingenuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| of us not to do our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| due diligence, have a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| draft document and we as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| work off of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| in these public forums with workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| where concerned residents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| business owners, property owners can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| and voice their comments and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| for council to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| for additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| that we will submit back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| MPC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| I would like for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| to put on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| for city council, however we have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| to make that, to put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| in motion because we do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| need to be in agreement on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| to some degree. We do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| about the next workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| We have a deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| to run an ad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| and if we're going to change the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| from what is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| February the 20th to some other date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| right now I don't have another date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| in mind, but if we change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| we need to know that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| because we've got a deadline and there's a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| The ad that got run the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| did it also already mention the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| 20th? It did, yes it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| So we'd have to make an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| adjustment there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| Okay. I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| concern is the time, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| if we're saying that there's not going to be a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| of changes in the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| portion and that's all we're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| at the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| You're pointing back at me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| You know as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| talk about the issues we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| tonight as Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| said we've jumped all around and we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| a lot of different components that will impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| whatever it is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| that will happen as well with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| residential. So it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| just be the residential section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| it will be other things that impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| But I can tailor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| as long as your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| are related to residential we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| stick to the residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| I guess I'm just going to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| I certainly would feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| if we commit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| another workshop past that to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| all the extraneous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| stuff that we're not going to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| tonight and not in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| time when the changes and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| more than two days to process the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| I was going to bring that up later so it's up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| That was my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| I've got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| proposed dates but I need to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| with Mr. Green and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| others before we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| come down on a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| I think you've moved forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| the meeting on the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| Let's set a third meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| and go through the rest of it. There's other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| components we want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| I think you draw a line and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| draw a date out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| and say we'll have a final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| We have to have a final draft to work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| whatever that is, pick a date. It can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| April 1st. Once we get past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| the workshops, once you've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| time to get past the workshops, once you've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| time to put a deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| on it, and then any changes from then on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| would have to be amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| on when we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| We'd be through with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| wordsmithing in the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| I appreciate that and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| Every time I've done this before, there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| a final draft that goes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| What I may propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| put out there that the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| will be the 18th, but maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| we can prolong that, take some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| comments and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| instead of having another draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| on the 18th, have it a week or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| later, take the direction that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| we're getting from council now and some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| later comments from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| create that final draft for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| council that would incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| a number of these changes and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| something that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| and then have time to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| amendments to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| Also at that, not the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| hearing, but the one after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| I would invite the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| so they can answer some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| questions like Council Member Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| asked, why did they do this when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| explain why, when I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| They know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| I have to admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| better than I do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| maybe better than Peter does, although he knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| it pretty well, but they may be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| find answers that, to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| quite honest, we're still searching for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| And that will definitely demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| another workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| past the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| I know that Mr. Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| looks like he would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| So Mr. Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| if you'd give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| you've got up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| Art Clancy, 1816 North Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| Technically we're still on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| hillside and ridgetop slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| We hadn't heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| And that's pertinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| In 2008, KUB decided to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| a water tower on our ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| right across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| You could see it from the Mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| immediately. MPC got a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| we need to do something to protect our hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| and ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| for scenic reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| We spent, not two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| but nearly three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| it was a lot closer to three, and almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| trying to figure out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| protect our ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| Knox County didn't adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| The city was smart enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| to adopt it. It wasn't perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| There's still things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| we deal with on hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| and ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| But it turns out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| KUB doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| have to come to City Council or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| MPC to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| water tower, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| turns out they prefer to build them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| It's similar to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| I'm on the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| Commission. I'm a Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| We sent you the final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| We've been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| several, several workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| of our own before we sent it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| But we didn't think it'd be your final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| document. It's our final one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| We know it's not perfect. We know we're going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| the next five and six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| probably making amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| hopefully not sending developers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| BZA with problems, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| solving them through amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| We know that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| As diligent as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| this Council is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| and it's impressive, you guys are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| asking good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| You're not going to get it 100% right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| I'd be willing to bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| Carlene probably isn't going to get it 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| Maybe. Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| There are going to be instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| in practical life that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| that we just don't see right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| As good as all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| of us are, none of us are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| planners. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| Gerald's the closest we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| He wants to be a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| It would be better if he did both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| Get it as close as you can, but let's start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| with something. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| a codes department that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| has developers coming in and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| what can I do and what can't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| City Council and our codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| need to work with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| Arons because we're losing developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| You're not going to have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| TIF money or pilot money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| that are going to make it worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| coming into the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| Knoxville to develop if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| get the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| department to where they can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| this is what the code is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| and this is the intent. We have to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| our codes have to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| the general population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| and make these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| but we can work it like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| and give them some latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| It's not going to be absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| perfect in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| That's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| Let's continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| with the policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| Mr. Clancy, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| for what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| That was just exactly what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| I would much prefer for us to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| to have these discussions about imperfections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| than to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| Knoxville, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| Planning Department, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| your new name is, to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| we're not going to take any more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| We're not going to listen to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| Here's the final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| Thank you for continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| to help develop this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| Thank you for continuing to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| this document evolve. I realize it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| frustrating but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| is what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Thank you. In response to that, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| have a meeting on the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| and we will consider residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| and pertinent things to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| Maybe it's not pertinent but based on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| Ms. Welch just said, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| did you say potentially you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| going to put out the next draft on the 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| that you'll hold and take our comments from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| workshop and put it all out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| together? I'll talk to the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| tomorrow but I think that would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| and our money better spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| than trying to do another one and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| another one, just wrap all this, get everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| take your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| and get everything as close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| See what we can get done together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| here in hours. And to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| up on Mr. Clancy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| comment, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| I've said this before, this is not a static| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| We as humans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| can't create something perfect but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| can do the best we can and know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| that we'll continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| as opportunities and challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| come up that we amend it and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| that process in place and keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| it a document that meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| the needs of the city of Knoxville. Now on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| landscaping standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9497)|
| 2:38:21| Ms. Malone? Thank you for your patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| and Carlene Malone, 6051| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| Fountain Road. We realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| you haven't moved during this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| My husband may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| gotta go home and check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| and yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| we cannot get something perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| we all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| but we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| voting on whether or not something is a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| and if we're doing it once every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9527)|

| 2:38:51| needs to take place. It does need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| legal vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| You guys need to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| policies and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| it says what you want it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| say. There's one thing Mr. Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| and I and I think he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| agree with me on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| is whether you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| associated with homeowner groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| or construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| and development groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| the one thing we all agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| is make the language clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| and enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| so we don't waste our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| on interpretations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| where nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| nobody wins. It's just a waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| across the board. It's a waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Now Mr. Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| and I might not agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| what I think it should say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| and what he thinks it should say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| but we ought to agree on what it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| and right now this document does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| have that level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| and I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| we're going to pay attorneys on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| or on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| I'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| someone other than attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| can get it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| The other thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| yes, zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| like every other piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| and you're not voting on a good idea, you're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| law. Every word is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| are living documents just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| every other piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| As Vice Mayor pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| was redone in 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| parking right before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| there were plenty of changes. We all know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| but here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| the thing. The reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| we need to get it as close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| to perfect as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| is because under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| and local law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| if we have a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| big boring spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| after this law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| it is protected under grandfathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| if it's next to me or next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| to you or in your neighborhood or in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| neighborhood, we're living with it forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| it's not going away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| so to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| yes we can always come back and amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| does not mean we can change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| something hideous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| that is impacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| negatively a neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| we know and love. It could be coming to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| your neighborhood, my neighborhood or neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| we don't even know of yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| due diligence is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| called for if you're doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| on this grand scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| once every 40, 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| you know how much time you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| spend arguing on something like whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| or not to put, when I was on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| whether or not to put lights on a ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| because we all understand lights on a ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| and it's impacts. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| impacts every piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| thank you Ms. Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| now are we ready to move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| alright let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| talk the other policy issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| landscaping standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| and the landscaping standards from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| parking ordinance were incorporated in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| there were some additional standards for site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| landscaping and buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| for parking areas have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| 10,000 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| parking area needs some landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| 20,000 square foot needs more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| under 10,000 does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| comments from members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| of the public that state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| those thresholds for parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| landscaping should be reduced, there should be bonding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| that landscaping survives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| there are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| standards for landscaping that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| requested. The staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| approach at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| their recommendation is to keep the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| that are in the parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| enhanced with those buffer requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| and some site landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| I wanted you to know that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| comments regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| get your input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| any input about the landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| thank you Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| I would tend to agree with the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| of leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| what is currently in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| there are good reasons for re-examining this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| but if we re-open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| and re-litigate these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| we're not staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| focused on what we're supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| doing which is updating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| and I think there's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| for us to talk about right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| just in this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| that we don't need to re-open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| things that had recently been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| passed so I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| leaving it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| as it is in landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| for parking and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| in the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| I don't think it's a good idea to go re-open that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| thank you. Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| I think it's the triggers that trigger it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| when you had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| put it in and when you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| I still think there ought to be some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| or inspection or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| something that it's put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| the way it was designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| I'll stick with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| but the triggers again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| on this renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| most of the properties in the cities that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| are renovated properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| some of the language that will be in the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| Peter mentioned this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| if a building has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| renovated and you're not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| anything to the parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| no parking enhancements or upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| conversely if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| don't do anything to the building and you rip up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| your parking area and rebuild it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| then you'd have to come in to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| Greenbelt development is a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| different than renovating development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| and most of what we have you pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| out the number of acres of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| developable land left in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| I mean it points to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| we're redeveloping it so that's where it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| difficult that's where you're going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| a lot of exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| but anyway I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| of the mindset that there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| something tied to it it shouldn't just be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| idea it should be inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| and verified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| was put in what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| put in like it was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| however you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| that tie it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| the CO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| or tie it to a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| there's different methods to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| thank you any other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| on landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| landscaping okay let's move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| make a brief comment one of the things I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| by attending or miss attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| several of these meetings was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| staff said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| on landscaping we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| cannot apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| people to make sure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| was done the way the plans we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| had in front of us and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| we just didn't have the staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| this comes back to council as a money question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| really if it takes staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| or if it takes a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| and it was a nice question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| do bonds scare the contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| approvals but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| has to be an enforcement mechanism I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Mr. Wallace addressed that that just says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| okay you put it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| did you do it according to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| did you put it in the time of year where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| going to survive or do you come back six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| months later and make sure it's still alive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| but that was a debate and it was really about money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| and money is your purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| you approve the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| thank you Mr. Delafoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Ms. Feld you want to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| please give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=9991)|

| 2:46:43| Knoxville and trees Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| and as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| landscaping standards go I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| reviewing a lot of ordinances from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| other cities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| what is in I want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| what has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| what is being added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| is a great addition because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| it's certainly a lot better than what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| currently but compared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| some other cities the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| are pretty minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| and a lot of cities have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| a lot more requirements than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| what will be required as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| a result of this ordinance and from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| the parking ordinance we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| have three main areas that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| would like to see beefed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| and for the first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| they appeared in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| earlier drafts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| some of them appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| in earlier drafts of the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| ordinance and some of them appeared in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| first draft of recode so they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| brand new ideas the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| idea is new for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| but one we do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| there should be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| landscaping standards applied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| parking lots for lots between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| 10,000 and 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| we think that there should be graduated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| landscaping islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| in the interior of those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| we think that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| landscaping bond is critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| ensure that the landscaping is installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| properly and that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| maintained for at least a minimum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| first of all landscaping as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| said has to go in at the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| time of the year you can't put your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| landscaping in when it's 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| degrees out in July and August and hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| that it's going to survive you've got to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| until the appropriate season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| to install landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| and to plant trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| Casey Krause doesn't plant any trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| in the city of Knoxville in July and August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| he plants trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| between November and March and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| that's it the rest of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| is dealt taking care of trees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| maintaining them so you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| got to give a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| the opportunity to put to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| the landscaping at the right time of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| and after that it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| should be the developer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| responsibility to maintain it for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| first two years because if you can get it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| the first two years it has a much better chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| of survival if you stick it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| the ground in July and you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| take care of it after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| and nobody is monitoring what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| happening it's not being watered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| it's not being cared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| trees are not being pruned adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| it's going to die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| and we operate on a complaint driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| system and then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| on the citizens responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| to monitor this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| and make a complaint and if they don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| what's in the original plan to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| how are they supposed to know that what's been put in the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| is commensurate with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| citizens don't know they don't have access to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| plans the third idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| is one that a lot of cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| have and that's to create a tree bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| and that means that in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| that the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| landscaping cannot be installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| for whatever reason topographical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| reasons geographical reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| that a developer can pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| bank and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| then that money can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10199)|

| 2:50:13| in fact Casey Cross told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| when he deals with local developers and they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| install the minimal landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| that's required they just say oh okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| that's fine with me but when he deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| with out of town developers they always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10223)|

| 2:50:27| have a tree bank I can pay into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| because they're used to dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| with that it's not an unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| request but we don't have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| did speak to Casey Cross and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| he and his department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10239)|

| 2:51:15| that don't come with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10275)|

| 2:51:27| incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10287)|

| 2:51:31| building heights reduced setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| basically being able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| more on a site in exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| for those design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| is that an appropriate approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10301)|

| 2:51:49| as I've stated we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| a number of zones that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| no design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10313)|

| 2:51:57| no material limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| I think we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| staff will look more closely at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| mapping of these zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| from staff's recommendation is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| to deal with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| council member Wallace and I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| I mentioned when he talked about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| concern about the building size limitation in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| office that maybe we set a threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| and anything over that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| a special use that's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10343)|
| 2:52:25| on a case by case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| maybe that's an approach in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| the office zone it could be used in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10349)|

| 2:52:55| citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10375)|

| 2:53:03| a little bit better or designed a bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| and then along some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| corridors should we be able to as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10387)|

| 2:53:27| standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| Are there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| or comments? Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| Design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| really came about when we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| approving dollar general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10417)|

| 2:53:41| became public and it all came into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| room right here and we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| decisions in neighborhoods saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| well how come you can't build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| this dollar general store over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| here with brick and with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| landscaping and this is where it all came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| about and said well this one doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| require use on review and this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| does and when it does dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| general was willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| put in whatever to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| the minimum standards and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| body got really this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| became an issue and we got to the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| and it got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| building materials and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| for certain zones I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| think particularly your neighborhood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| it should be higher I mean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| should be it should reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| the neighborhood around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| it should have less vinyl and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| more brick and it should have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10469)|
| 2:54:31| and there's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| nothing wrong with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| but if you don't have the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| then people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| dollar general says that's our brand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| and that's what we want to build and that's what we built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| so I think you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| to have it in there and you got to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| I mean I know the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| here has been where you're raising the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| and this will come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| on the 20th and we talk about it in residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| zones when you put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| bar really low then you keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| cost low to build it and well that's true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| but you also keep your quality low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| so I actually think you ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| have design standards and you ought to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| building standards in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| and they ought to be as high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| as we think we can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| I don't think what you put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| is too high, let's put it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10519)|

| 2:55:25| I think that the design standards that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| in here and having participated in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| the stakeholder committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| they're reasonable, they're minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| I really like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| idea that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| you're incentivizing design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| by saying you want more intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| follow some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| design standards, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| it's a good balance for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| just to go back to the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| standards, they are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| very minimal in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| having again sat through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| the stakeholder committee meetings, listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| to the pros and cons and sort of the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| that it should go in, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| the standards that are in there are minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| they're appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| I think it's the least that we can expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| and I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| that I share the concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| whether or not we can create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| a process that allows developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| to plant at the appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| and that makes sure that we can enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| those standards over the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| in support of what you have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| Councilman Starr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| Thank you, I'd agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| with what's been said on the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| and I think one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| we sort of went down this road, at least for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10598)|
| 2:56:41| was looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| when the city wanted to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| whether it was South Waterfront or Cumberland or downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| they came up with a whole new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| form-based codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| is the idea with this going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| that there will be less of a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| for form-based codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| like on Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| or Sevier Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| or parts of Sutherland or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| We're hopeful that these design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| will address a lot of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| that heretofore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| were addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| with much more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| with the form codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| I'm not going to say there's not a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| for more that will identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| that would justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| more design standards of form code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| but we're trying to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| a bit higher standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| as a higher bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| as Councilmember Wallace said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| to larger areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| and do it incrementally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| as Councilmember Welch said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| these are not onerous standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| they're pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| a starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| to see where we can go and what the reaction is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| Okay, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| Let's move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| I'm sorry, is there anybody in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| that wants to make a comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| the design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| Okay, good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| Let's move on then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| I'm not going to say much about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| building size and office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| We've beat that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| pretty much, so whatever direction you give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| we do have some options staying with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| that we're making at some threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| of special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| Transition zones, this came up as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10705)|

| 2:58:35| There weren't enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| transition zones in some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| and we have transition zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| in our ordinance, we have the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| based on the built character of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| sometimes it's difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| place those transition zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| It's getting late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| I'm getting tongue tied I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| Four hours without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10733)|

| 2:58:59| This late without beer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| starting to tell on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| have those tools in place so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| they can be used for rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| and as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| forward we are, where appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| mapping transition zones, but we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| have them and we have them as a tool for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| use and I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| adequately covered in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| People are leaving so I'm going to keep going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| Zoning of older industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| areas, maybe I can chase everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| away except Tim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| of older industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| We've had some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| about the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| mixed use, I think we've addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| those, I'll work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| Chamber of Commerce in making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| we've addressed the concerns with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| Thank you sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| You'll see that often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| That comes without a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Thank you Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10797)|
| 3:00:03| I really need direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| This blends into our residential so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10805)|
| 3:00:07| it's a good place to leave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| There are some places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| are older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| areas of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| that were zoned industrial and never developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| for industrial purposes for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| Some off on the west side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| Chapman Highway near Baxter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| Used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| residential purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| We've changed the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| from industrial to residential because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| we've heard from City Council there's a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10835)|

| 3:00:39| in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| We hear from the Chamber that there's a need for industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| We need direction on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| are we headed in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| direction with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| We have not changed the designation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| properties used for industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| from that industrial classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| It's those that aren't used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| Is that the correct approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10859)|
| 3:01:05| Questions? Councilwoman Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| Gerald, do we have any data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| that would help drive this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| decision? I mean it seems to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| part of the decision is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| where is the demand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Is there a huge amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| I'll work with the Chamber on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| if that's okay to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| At this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| currently industrially zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| properties that we've designated as residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| a lot of them, most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| we looked at and they're individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| property owners, only a couple are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| property owners that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| more than one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| That made us feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| if they're individual property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| and used for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| purposes, but we'll work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| the Chamber to get data on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| demand for industrial space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| We do have a fair amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| the Chamber may argue with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| but underutilized industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| Existing industrial property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| is underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| I guess that's, you know, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| leave it zoned as industrial and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| it's never utilized in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| manner, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| I guess that's just data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| We haven't done much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| industrial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| designation to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| It's primarily currently used for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| so we designated it residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| When in doubt, leave it alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| It's a lot easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| down zone this residential than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| it is to up zone it industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| Just leave it alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| and let the market take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| and if the market comes back and says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| rezone this to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| that'll be very easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| It's almost on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10975)|
| 3:02:57| when it's going down, but if you take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| and go residential and try to rezone it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| to industrial, it invokes a fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| and I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| leave it alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| and let the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| and the market says, hey, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| we want this to go residential and that's where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| demand is and the market will take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| And one challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| an issue that comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| Another challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| We've had that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| No, it's just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| if I own a residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| and it's zoned industrial and I sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| and Councilmember Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| wants to buy it and needs a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| we can't give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| letter that the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| allows that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| and those are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| that maybe tug at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| when I'm looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| and there's a lot of parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11027)|
| 3:03:49| and just another thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| keeps me awake at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| Let the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| and the market will take care of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| areas where those are exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| The way the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| is those areas have become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| less than desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| They've become less than desirable because of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| financing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| And because they're up against the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| Not always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| That's one of your points in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| I'd say leave it alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| I just was going to say and I'm trying to find the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| email from earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| This exact issue came up today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| in my district or very near to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| Well it's Dameron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| so it's mine. It was close to Mark's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| All that area and I'm looking at it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| existing and proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| All that stuff up the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| second creek and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| was blanket zoned industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| and there are people living there all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| the health department and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| It's residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| Here in the proposed, I mean I'll have to go case by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| case and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| The ones with houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| have been proposed are in four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| and the ones that are actually industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| there's some supply houses back there and all that stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| They're IMU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| and I think that's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| Right now most of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| shotgun houses. They're the workers that worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| at the mill that's no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| I don't really understand any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| that they should continue to be industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| They're houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| and we don't want to lose that housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| and it's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| and so the issue that came up today was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| one of the lots that's empty is being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| as a dumping ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| and city staff said something in the email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| to me which I can't find it the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| about it being undevelopable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| because of its industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| and its lot size of 50 by 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| which is what we're fixing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| for anybody who wants to say we don't need to be doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| and nobody asked for this recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| we're doing it because the stuff in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| in the old neighborhoods is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| unbuildable and you have to go get variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| to actually use the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| and you can't finance a project on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| industrial lots and you can't sell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| and they're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| anomalies that make, render| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| them undevelopable as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| they sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| Thank you. Now, Mr. Dellavopia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| I know you want to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| Nick Dellavopia, Halston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| When I was on council we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| these cases come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| individuals would contact you and the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| really was as said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| banks will look at that and say I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| want to give you a loan to improve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| house because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| it burns or something I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| have my security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| interest protected I really can't rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| it and so some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| it's a map making thing to answer Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| Wallace we're not changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| zoning in terms of its definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| but some of these parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| were labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| like she said in a blanket fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| and they can be cleaned up on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| I don't think there should be any difficulty for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| Yeah, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| Alright, any other questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| If not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| Peter has a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| I do, just one question, I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| you know we've expressed that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| wanted to provide some new language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| as far as those triggers and thresholds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| for upgrading parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| and the associated areas associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| with that but then I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| leave it all alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11249)|
| 3:07:31| so where should we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| from, we don't have hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| data, it's all anecdotal, Scott's in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| he can probably tell you every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| project that has been shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| because they've hit the threshold for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| redevelopment and therefore they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| to fix their parking lots and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| the cost associated with all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| those fixes is making the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| we've seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| happen more often in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| those areas with lower property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11281)|
| 3:08:03| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| as staff we were thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| we would suggest some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| that would allow those developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| don't look at Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| laughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| but is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| a direction that you want us to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| on or do you want us to just leave parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| alone and say it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| to be left alone and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| push my button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| Councilwoman Reuter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| I'll just make the comment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| I did watch the presentations at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| the design charrette last week and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| of the six groups that presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| the one thing that was consistent among all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| of them were the words parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| I guess that's one word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| they designed things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| I mean folks that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| and were more involved for the whole day can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| speak on it but it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| just striking that parking kept coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| and we would have done this but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| but the developers at the table said we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| have more parking and we got to have parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11343)|
| 3:09:05| I see a shaking head there for someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| was at a table so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| I don't know there seemed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| a lot of decisions at the charrette that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| driven by parking issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| were not related to the code the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| for example in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| 5th Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| site the code requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| no off street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| the developer demanded parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| micro parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| standard knitting mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| we found that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| they did not want to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| because of the size of the building the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| based on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| ratio was more than they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| provide but we allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| the staff to reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| parking requirement with the parking study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| there's no definition of what a parking study is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| it's pretty open so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| I think from that standpoint of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| parking requirements this code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| addresses that it's the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| that is the challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| in terms of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| a lot of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| need direction on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| when does the parking have to be upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| when does landscaping have to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| in relation to redevelopment of a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11411)|
| 3:10:13| okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| it right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| what is it right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| the way you proposed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| as soon as you spend 51% all of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| parking needs to comply with the current code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| but the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| takes away the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| building relationship to the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| improve your building but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| your parking I'm an advocate for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| if I'm spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| all my money on the inside of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| and I haven't touched the parking lot, I haven't added on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| I haven't done anything to the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| I don't think it should trigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| that's the feedback we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| that's kind of where we were heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| but I didn't want us to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| spending a lot of energy and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| drafting language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| is understandable and enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| if that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| where we wanted to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| I think you're going to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| at BZA on some of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| if I put the traffic islands in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| then I don't meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| minimum parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| what do you want? Minimum parking or do you want traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| cut it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11487)|
| 3:11:29| those are the kind of things you're going to end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11489)|
| 3:11:31| I assume that's going to be a BZA request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| you can go back to BZA for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| or can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| you've got staff approval for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| there is with the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| that the staff can reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| parking requirement with the parking study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| there is latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| thank you Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| my comment earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| specifically about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| relitigating anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| in the parking ordinance or in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| sign ordinance and to leave those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| things alone and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| have substantial changes to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| because I think if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| reopen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| there may be really good points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| that we want to talk about in making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| some potential changes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| this is not the time to do that, that was my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| keeping those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| substantially the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| as they are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| allows us to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| on the task at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| which is to update the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| code, that was my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| thank you, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| Attorney Frost would like to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| thank you Mr. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| this is I guess a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| I was sitting here tonight thinking about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| and I can't believe how much time has passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| this is my 18th year of sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| or have been sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| so I've seen a lot of what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| people know I call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| zoning train wrecks and I've seen the litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| going through things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| I've got just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| simple requests to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| variances and uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| on review are very hotly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| contested issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| and if you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| criteria for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| special uses the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| that's on 16-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| and 16-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| fewer criteria than the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| uses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| review and the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| we have right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| very beneficial in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| defending counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| in court, it provides some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| clarity, it's the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| that's been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| for decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| and the same goes with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| on page 16-7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| the standards under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| variances, those aren't the current standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| that are on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| right now and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| I mentioned before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| those are the things we go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| over and those are the things that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| defended counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| and the definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| that particularly jumped out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| on me that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| the current zoning but not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| recode are accessory building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| accessory structure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| accessory use. We had litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| passed probably three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| years ago dealing with the crematorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| in Fountain City that dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| accessory uses. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| Mr. DellaVoppe was there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| I've spent some of my youth on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| So, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| just in looking at things because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| Council Member Roberto asked me to go through things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| and look at things using, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| looking at your lawyer and looking at somebody who's sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| through many years of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| those change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| in the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11689)|
| 3:14:51| I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| like what's on the books right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| and I don't know if it's possible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| take what we have on the books right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| cut, copy, and paste and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| put them in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| And I thank God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| I mentioned this to Mrs. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| I didn't marry her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11709)|
| 3:15:11| Now there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| with the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| they've taken what's worked in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| and brought it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| and neither Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| nor I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| poor Christina just got into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| that we don't have the history that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| so we need that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| we really appreciate that, having that history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| and that knowledge to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| as we move forward. So anything you find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| that has been litigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| or if you find something that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| help us keep from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| it litigated, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| We've got a little bit more. I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| talk to the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| tomorrow and talk with the Vice Mayor Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| and see when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| third meeting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| and when we need that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| final draft and then let you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| so if you find things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| we'll have a deadline for comments so we can get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| that final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| Thank you. Are there any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| comments on the bulk of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11769)|

| 3:16:25| that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| we can review them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| and make sure we've got it. We can work through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| definitions, things not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| in this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11793)|

| 3:16:49| I think in the interest of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| I'd like to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| to council that we limit it to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| Is there an agreement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| Or is there a disagreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| Okay, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11821)|

| 3:17:13| I don't think he's here. Carleen, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11833)|

| 3:18:01| Knoxville, Knox County, whatever we're called now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| I'm on it and don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| We did feel, and I echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| what Art Clancy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| We knew it wasn't perfect, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| we needed to move it along, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| I do want you to realize, and I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| are getting it tonight, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| you do have to have a final document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| document is not final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| and we sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| four pages I think a few days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| to Gerald and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| he has agreed to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| changes. Some of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| events that are undefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| Some are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11915)|
| 3:18:37| has to do with confusing language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| and so it's not so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| about the big do we have ADUs or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| things like that, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| events that occur that trigger something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| else, such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| I'll give you just one example. We've got many, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| when a non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| now they deem it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| special use, it goes empty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| but what if that same use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| within say the six months and it was being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11943)|
| 3:19:05| marketed? Does it have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| the planning commission or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| not? So that's an event that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| undefined and there are a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| of other things and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| think he's getting real close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| to a final document, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| I would hope that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| next sequence would be when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| we get the final document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| we still have public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| and if they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| voluminous, that we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| up yet another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| I think maybe one more may do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| but it may not, and if it doesn't, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11979)|
| 3:19:41| go with what it takes to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| close. Not dead right, but get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| close. And as far as I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| make two comments about the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| from the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| standpoint, they've had a lot of problems with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| 50% rule and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| if the building doesn't change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| all it does, it makes us underestimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| the values of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| our renovation, which they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| enforce, they can't argue. I may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| an in-house contractor and I don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| budget, so I can make it whatever I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| I think it discourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| reinvestment in existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| and the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| I think it's a simple fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| As far as making sure what goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| you either have a landscape architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| certify it or you have a surveyor doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| as built, just like he does the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| All righty, Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| Larry Silverstein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| 7808 Sheffield Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| Knoxville. First of all, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| commend you for this session. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| been very worthwhile and very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| helpful and I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| forward to the next one or however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| many more we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| Just a few comments from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| sitting here for the last three and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| I spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| here on September the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| and at that time I urged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| City Council to take charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| of the timetable and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| take however much time it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| to get this as right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| as possible. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| seems like a long time ago, September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| the 20th, but I'm here to say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| Take however much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| it takes to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| Along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| we need an adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| time to review the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| whenever that may come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| to make comments. There were a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| of changes between draft three and draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| four. We were told, oh, there's not that many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| changes. Well, it takes a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| of time to review almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| 300 pages just to even see what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| changed, more or less decide whether the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| were good or not. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| give us all enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| You're going to need time, but the public needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| time to review it, just to even see what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| in the next draft. So please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| next time, give us more time to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| You all did get our comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| I hope, from Community Forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| just in the last couple days. I'm sure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| haven't had a chance to look at it, but please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12119)|
| 3:22:03| The next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| workshops have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| the issues and the articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| that were not addressed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| and they won't be addressed, apparently, the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| time. There are lots and lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| of things that we have written up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| about. So please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| however long it takes, and if we can't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| in one more workshop, do it in two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| workshops. We've got to go through that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| There's some really important stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| there that has not been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| tonight, and probably won't be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| at your next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| Last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| as you probably know, I am an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| I don't practice law very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| and never have, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| enough to know that this recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| is law. You're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| about law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| This isn't just ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| this is law, and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| trying to change the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| all of it, on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| zoning issues. It's really, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| If we're going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| the law, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| to be sure that we all understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| and you all particularly need to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| what is the rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| for changing what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| already have. I know several people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| said the same thing, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| if the existing language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| is good, and we understand what it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12197)|
| 3:23:19| then let's not just throw it out and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12199)|
| 3:23:21| oh, we're not going to use it because somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12201)|

| 3:23:27| Sometimes the best answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| is leave it alone. Use our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWS190207?start=12209)|
