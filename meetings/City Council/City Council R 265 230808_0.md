| 0:02:24| Eight present, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Thank you. Is there a motion on the minutes from our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Motion made to approve and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=150)|

| 0:02:36| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Are there any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| And I don't think there's anything on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| So we'll move right on to my Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| I want to start off by recognizing the significance of this day, the 8th of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| to start off by recognizing the significance of this day, the 8th of August. I just left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| the Beck Cultural Exchange Center's 8th of August event at the Tennessee Theater where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| hundreds of people came together to remember Emancipation Day here in Tennessee. On this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| day in 1863, the future U.S. President Andrew Johnson freed his slaves in Tennessee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| others followed. So since that day, it's been a day of celebration of emancipation in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| and around the state. So thank you to the Beck and to others who have organized events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| to help educate and memorialize the significant events and what they mean to the fabric of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| our city. Today, as Councilmember Smith mentioned in his invocation, is the first day back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| school for all Knox County Schools students, parents, and staff. And I was really happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| to join members of the Austinese community this morning as they laid down the red carpet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| and welcomed students back with music and the Roadrunner and a lot of festivities. Even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| some teens who don't like to smile in the face of adults and feel embarrassed, I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| see some smiles coming out. So it was really nice to be part of that and I want to welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| all the children of our city back to school. Hopefully, it will be a safe and productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| and good learning year for all. Yesterday, we had some really severe weather here. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| fact, the National Weather Service said that there was indeed a tornado that touched down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| in our area. So I wanted to take a minute to thank all of the first responders and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| service crews and traffic engineers and signal engineers and also our first responding partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| throughout the community who answered the call and dealt with all the many issues going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| on around our community. To my knowledge, and thankfully, there were no serious injuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| reported, but a lot of frightening moments and there's still a lot of cleanup to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| So I also, you know, thanks to our public service workers, firefighters, police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| utility crews, our 311 operators and many others who worked all night to keep people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| safe and to restore power. There were more than 200 reports in Knoxville of downed trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| and we were also happy to send our firefighters and others to the assistance of the Lovell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Crossing apartment complex that was one of the most severely hit just outside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| limits. KFD and KPD also responded to dozens of calls of blocked intersections, downed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| power lines, natural gas leaks, fire alarms, car wrecks and more. So please keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| if you or someone you know experienced damage to your property and do not have the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| means to clean it up, you can request help from Crisis Cleanup by calling 865-351-0555| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| to. So if you need help with cleanup, call 865-351-0552. Also, I know there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| people in the audience here tonight who signed up to speak about the really rapid rise in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| rent in our Knoxville community. This is a really hard situation and I'm grateful for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| your presence here. I just wanted to use my Mayor's Report to share a little bit of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| on the front end. First, several people have asked whether and why the city hasn't imposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| rent control. So I wanted to ask our Law Director to share with Council and members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| what the law is that prevents us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| Mayor, the state legislature has adopted an entire chapter of the state code with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| to the subject of rent control. It is at 6635-102 and the primary part of that statute starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=398)|
| 0:06:50| off, a local governmental unit shall not enact, maintain or enforce an ordinance or resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=410)|
| 0:07:00| that would have the effect of controlling the amount of rent charged for leasing private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| residential or commercial property. So it's preempted by the state is the short answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| So Council members and members of the audience here present today, thank you for coming or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| those who are watching remotely. It is not allowed in the state of Tennessee for municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| to impose rent control. However, I do want to let people know that there are resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| out there for people in crisis. First, if you or someone you know is in need of making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| a rental payment and need help, you can call 2-1-1 to connect with organizations who may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| be able to assist you. So that's just calling 2-1-1 during business hours. If you are facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| eviction, please know your rights and know the process. Just because you received an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| eviction notice does not mean you have to leave immediately. And please show up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| any court appearances. Also, we have listed on our city website resources for renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash renter resources to connect with information and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| that can help you navigate and avoid eviction. And we just updated that page today. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| there's the most current information available for those struggling to pay their rent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| stay in their homes. That's the short-term solutions that we have available. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| this council is very familiar with the long-term efforts that we are making promoting affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| and workforce housing development, offering pilots for low-income housing tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| promoting missing middle, and many others. So that's going to continue to be a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| for me as mayor, as I know it will be for this council. And I appreciate all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| partners who are working creatively and with urgency to address housing affordability in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Knoxville. Last, I want to do a quick reminder on our rules of decorum. For those who wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public forum, please sign up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| the city recorder, Mr. Johnson, ahead of time. Please do not use profanity. And when speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| to specific agenda items, please remember to stay on topic. Those who fail to adhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium. For those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| Those who do may be asked to leave. Thank you in advance for respecting these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| And that concludes my mayor's report. Are there reports of council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you, Mayor. As we heard in the invocation, just wanted to remind everybody here and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| watching at home that our city elections are upon us. Early voting begins tomorrow, August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=570)|

| 0:09:41| hours and locations for early voting. Also, primary election day is August 29th, so please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| make sure you get out and let your voice be heard and vote in our elections. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to speak to what you were talking about with rents going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| and housing prices and, you know, we all know that this is in a crisis state. I know all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| of us are getting phone calls that are just people sobbing, people not knowing what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| going to do next. It's about, we're about 10,000 houses from living spaces from bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=610)|
| 0:10:19| this to an affordable city again. We are going to have to make some really hard decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| that are on zoning that are going to make our constituents very angry. And I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| we all have the courage to do that. You know, at this point, it feels like we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| who have and people who will never have. And it's, you know, the income inequality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| and the housing inequality in Knoxville is, we hear about it every single day and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| got to do something. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=646)|

| 0:12:09| to speak now or speak at 9B or 9C, whatever you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| Let's do it. I'm for, you know, anything that provides housing. That being said, as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=734)|
| 0:12:24| preemptively spoke to the issue, there are a bunch of people here who are from the Tanglewood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| apartment community and they've been going through a whole bunch of stuff. And a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| of them have found a way to come together and voice their common concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=759)|
| 0:12:48| But that being said, just knowing that you have resources that may or may not be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| because I'm a renter and only reason that I have a roof over my head right now is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| of the compassion shown to us by a particular individual. And, but that's not the case with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=782)|
| 0:13:12| a lot of people who reside at properties that are owned and or run by RAND in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=792)|
| 0:13:24| And that's the problem because we've been talking about affordable housing, we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| talking about housing availability. This is not even a three, five-year or five-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| even 10-year situation. This has been building up continually for at least 20 years. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| we've had multiple opportunities to help alleviate this type of situation. We just have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| the city of Knoxville has not taken this by the horns. And it's now coming back to haunt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| us. You want growth, you want development, you focus on particular areas, the high revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| end areas of development, and then you find hardworking people getting pushed out. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| find veterans on disability getting pushed out or being scared to death that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| going to get pushed out. All the time they're having to deal with management that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| responsive to their needs. All they're interested in is bringing in the money. And there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| accountability. And I don't know what you as city council and the mayor and administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| can do to alleviate this situation and bring some relief to folks like the folks at Tanglewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| I don't know exactly what you can do. Well, no, I do know what you can do. And it hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| been done. Let's be honest. Okay? It hadn't been done. Because you had that focus, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=894)|
| 0:15:03| on the high end, high revenue areas of development. Okay? And mayor, to be honest with you, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=903)|
| 0:15:12| you did a post on your Facebook page about you're proud to ride the bus, and I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| talking about that later on, about riding the bus. Okay? Knowing the general area in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| which you live, your easiest straight route to come to work if you're going to ride the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| bus is the 22 Broadway bus. The only reason I know that is because I've ridden every freaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| route that CAT offers. Okay? For a long time. I don't do it now. I have a vehicle available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| to me. However, back in the day, that was my primary, 95% of my transportation needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| were met by CAT. Okay? So that means you would have to come down and come to an area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| illustrates to you the need for affordable housing, the need to take care of the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| of these. And I've used this word before before you guys. They're called the on-and-wim. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| They're the working poor. They're the people who, you know, they give up and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| an expectation of life. But, you know, our city government has not been responsive. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=973)|
| 0:16:23| be honest. Okay? The first time you had a cage set up, that should give you indication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=983)|
| 0:16:33| And you're getting ready to have a whole bunch of other people who have to worry about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| type of situation. Okay? Because they're being pushed out by money-hungry people who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| give a damn about them. Bottom line. Okay? And you guys got to figure something out about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| how to give them some relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1009)|
| 0:17:04| Council, that concludes the people signed up to speak on Item 9A. Are there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| or comments? Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you, Mayor. And thank you for your words, Rick. I agree with what Rick had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| share tonight. And what I wanted to comment on this agenda item is this is an item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1039)|
| 0:17:30| came before us approved by the Planning Commission but did not receive the approval of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| staff. And usually I do like to follow the recommendations of planning staff. But in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| this situation, they did not approve this development because there was a study that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| hasn't been conducted of this area. But there is some anticipation that this is the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| that this area would move into. In general, we are going to have to make some tough zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1074)|
| 0:18:03| decisions and I want us to make smart decisions and ensure that we have, you know, the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| in place that we need to support new developments. But at times, like the issue before us currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| we may need to act as a legislative body even when we haven't been able to get the studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| in place to warrant this action. It also reminds me that we do have limited staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| still dedicated to various issues related to planning and plans and review to help these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| developments move forward. So I just wanted to take this opportunity. This is on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| reading but I didn't speak about it at the last meeting just to say that this is an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| of, you know, new innovative projects that we need to see in our community and that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| been slowed down because we haven't had the capacity to implement these studies. But I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| in support of it. Thank you. Council Member Testerman. Thank you, Mayor. I just I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| to reiterate as well, you know, I drive by this particular property on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| and the street is and where this proposed development is going or these proposed residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1163)|
| 0:19:33| are going is virtual blight as it is. And so, you know, again, going back to what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| law director said, I mean, you know, we're our hands are tied on some things and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| know, developers are not the bad guys. I mean, there are a lot of developers that are committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| to affordable housing and are committed to workforce housing. And, you know, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| in this case. And so I think there are some people out there that are generally genuinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| invested. But I agree. I mean, we are in a crisis and it's time to to move forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| look at things earnestly and how we can come to some better solutions. But on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| item, I think this is a good proposal. It's a growing area. And what's currently there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| is really in disrepair. Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Yeah. So I also until quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1227)|
| 0:20:37| recently drove by these every single day. These have been vacant houses for about eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| years. They're condemned. Mr. Jernigan, I know part of the discussion at the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| Commission was the nature of the of the zoning, because instead of a residential zone, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| a commercial zone because it allows you to do slightly different, maybe more units. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| don't recall our exact conversation about that. But what is your anticipation of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| many units of housing will be here where we've had no occupancy for at least eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| about that? I recall currently seven getting Garrett Jernigan five to four, six Bent River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee. So when the properties were purchased, there were only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| there were three structures on the property that were already we bought them when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| were already boarded up by the city from the previous owners had let them. There was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| there was a woman who had lived there for many, many years and kept the property up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| When she passed, for one reason or another, the properties went into disrepair. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| really know the history of it, but when we bought them, they were already boarded up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| by the city. So right now, the plan is to put seven units back onto the property with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| part, you know, with parking in the rear. And so what the the CG to zone allows for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| more flexibility as to where to place the units and how we can get vehicles in and around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| at the rear. The problem with the existing zone was the set, even though it allowed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| technically allows for four plexus in the zone. Once you get the setbacks in installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| on the property, it really limits what you can do on on on a small infill lot like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| working on. OK, and then I believe part of your conversation with the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| was the design guidelines also come with this to ensure that it has windows. Correct. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| doors also have to face the street. I can't remember those particular. Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| And yeah, so it's and it just, you know, flexibility and how we get how we can get these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| on or how we can get the the units onto the property. It just allows for more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| design. OK, and what's your time frame? We'd like to start immediately. But what's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1382)|

| 0:24:03| again. Again, I'm going to keep harping on this as I've got the opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| to it. I've been to planning commission meetings in the past when it was Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1450)|
| 0:24:20| Commission. And there is a process in place right now which is totally exclusionary to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| the people who are going to benefit from having a roof over their head. OK. And for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| who want to maybe start a business. We went to a whole thing about recode. We went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| this whole thing. OK. I remember that first meeting at or the meeting that I first attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| at Central United. And remember we had one, you remember we had that NAC reunion group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| there and everything. And lo and behold, a former city council person was there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1494)|
| 0:25:04| I was warned that this was a bunch of hoodoo. The recode was not going to do it. OK. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1504)|
| 0:25:13| people had not been truly included and they weren't dealing with the whole process, OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1513)|
| 0:25:22| of, you know, from the planning commission to coming to the county commission and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| council. And, you know, I'm not privy to all the insider information. OK. Most of us aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1527)|
| 0:25:36| OK. But noticing the process, it was obviously an exclusionary process. People's voices weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1536)|
| 0:25:45| being heard. And now we have what we have now. You have people coming for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| time to a city council meeting, some of whom didn't even know where the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| was but they knew they had to be here. OK. Because they're being threatened with not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| having a roof over their head or not being able to have a roof over their head. OK. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| is what it's come to. Now, again, I'm for development and I'm not here specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| I'm for any developer that provides housing, OK, but at an affordable rate. And I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| given a slight lecture about the fact that most developers have no control over cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| of development. OK. So now they come before you guys, the planning commission, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| know what the recommendation was from the planning commission. Was it an 11-0 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| the approval? OK. It comes before you guys for approval. And lo and behold, Victor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| going to get it. And that's good. That's all well and good. Bottom line though is, OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| the people that need the housing the most aren't going to be affected. If they are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| to be affected, it's going to be in a negative way. OK. This has been going on forever. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1622)|
| 0:27:11| you can't say we haven't noticed that it was going on. You can't say we weren't paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| attention. OK. You can't say that. You guys have been around too long. OK. You've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| too involved at community levels to not have said, this is what's coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| This is what's going to happen. I'm going to put forth a premise here. I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| give you a premise. Some of you, most of you, want to act like you give a damn. OK. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| the result is it feels like you don't. OK. Whether you do or not, it feels like you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| OK. And it's a very frustrating thing because I've talked to and worked with and been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| the same room with a lot of you. OK. I've supported a few of you. OK. And, man, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1678)|
| 0:28:10| are some hard times. And if we don't figure this thing out quickly, if there is not some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| boldness, if there is not some vision, OK, and you guys have the skills and the expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1694)|
| 0:28:24| and you know the people who have the skills and the expertise, OK, but you have to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| you're not going to do it for the people who already have the most. That's got to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| That's got, that's over with. OK. That has to end because if you don't do it, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| going to have a lot of people knocking at your door who are in need. I mean, literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| knocking at your doors. OK. And they're going to ask you why things haven't been done. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1728)|
| 0:28:58| And they're right down the road here, people. They're right down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1738)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you. Council, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on Item 9B. Any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| or discussion? Council Member Parker. Thank you, Mayor. In that last discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| it really struck me that this development will be finished in a year. And it just made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1760)|
| 0:29:31| me think, how many other projects that are actually affordable, you know, this is, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1771)|
| 0:29:40| know, not reserved for affordable housing. But what if we put a plan in place and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| able to produce, chip away at that 10,000 affordable housing stock need that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| and we were able to produce a significant level of new affordable housing. And what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| I see other cities do is float a bond. And this bond can be available for new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1804)|
| 0:30:15| and it can be a no interest loan. It can be a grant. But that can be money that is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1815)|
| 0:30:25| It's the lowest interest rate on the market are these government bonds. And instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| just providing funding to provide that gap funding for projects, we could actually make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| a significant amount of funding available for developers to move forward with affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| housing projects that they could deliver on within a year. That is something that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| is in, within our ability, we have a, I think we still have a triple A bond rating. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| not sure how the baseball stadium has impacted that yet. But we have a strong bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| which means we will have a low interest rate, much lower than what developers have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| to in the market. And that might be something that is able to move projects forward. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| we can be able to celebrate the affordable housing projects that will be finished within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| a year, not just those that will come to our community at market rate and potentially increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| other housing prices in the area around it. So that would be my recommendation is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| we look for solutions that we can employ today that would be able to push affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1902)|
| 0:31:52| development forward. And we can see the results of it a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| Any other questions or discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Roberto. I just want to ask our finance director, Director Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| do you recall, I think this number is correct, in this year's budget, don't we invest seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| and a half, almost seven and a half million dollars in affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Boy 7 CFO for the city, that is correct. It's like $100,000 shy of $7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| And there's specifically two and a half million in affordable rental housing, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| I believe so. Okay. And I think that we've heard a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1958)|
| 0:32:48| you know, missing middle, and that's been a discussion and that'll be something we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| a workshop on coming up. And to get to, you know, what my colleague, Councilmember Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| had mentioned about that, I think there are some things that we're going to have to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| at. The, there's not a lot of property that we're talking about that exists. We're, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| we go through today's agenda, we're going to see a lot of, you know, challenged properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| that are looking to be developed on. And so that's what we're left with there. You had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| mentioned a number, which I think is correct, about needing about 10,000 units. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| that's a right number. We do need to get some significant numbers like that. We're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| to find that in existing, you know, empty spaces, or even in missing middle. The solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| is going to be in using our TIFs and pilots to build mixed-use development along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| where we have existing businesses now, and we can have residential units there. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| is a place where we have the infrastructure to support this. And there is space in existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| businesses to do it. We don't need to borrow money to do that. We have existing incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| that can encourage that. And so I know council has discussed this many times, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| this is part of the continuing discussion we will have, is that we need to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| to do that so that good folks, hardworking folks like the people who have come here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| who are in a very bad spot, who are saying, hey, find something to help us. We can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| stuff. We heard early on from the mayor about phone numbers that can be called, about people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| you can get assistance from, and I think that's good, and I would encourage folks to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| In the long run, and even in the short run, what we need to be doing is making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| we take advantage of the things that we did in RECODE, which was to provide space for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| that mixed-use, and we need to encourage it and make sure it happens so that we can start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| building the units that we really need to help the folks out that are here today. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Yes. I want to echo a lot of what my colleague just said. I didn't know he was going to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| that point up, but it was very well taken. And Mr. Roach talked about how it's time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| some bold action, and I think that's true, and I think that we're going to have to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| at different ways of finding locations for housing. And traditionally, the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| administrations, like administrations in many cities, have taken kind of a passive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| to where development occurs. And it's basically kind of been driven by where developers can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| develop conveniently. And lots of times, that's in neighborhoods where there is a limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| amount of space. And I think we really need to take a bold approach and start looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| at our corridors, where there is a lot of blighted property there. The infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| is there. There's a customer base for the businesses when new residence is there. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| opportunity for employment at those businesses. And people who would have an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| live on the corridors, it would be a better quality of life because the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| is there and transportation is there. It wouldn't be easy to do. It's going to take a shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| in a paradigm, but I think we really, really need to look at that because the space is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2182)|
| 0:36:30| limited and we also need to protect the fabric of our neighborhoods as well. And when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2190)|

| 0:36:51| healthy neighborhoods. That means mental health. That means less crime. And human beings weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| made to live in some ways that overdense housing without the ability to get out into nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2219)|
| 0:37:08| or to take transportation. We're not designed to live that way without adverse effects on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| our quality of life and our mental health and aggressiveness and whatever. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| we really need to take a bold look at these blighted areas on our corridors. I think Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| Person Ryder in the last city council, maybe it was a workshop, talked about all the places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| on Broadway that had been abandoned by retail stores that had gone out of business. A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| of that retail is not going to come back because people are doing a lot of their shopping online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| But what that gives us is an opportunity to develop these areas and do it in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| doesn't negatively impact existing neighborhoods. So I encourage that we start thinking outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| the box and take some bold steps. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. I'm not sure who was first between Ms. Singh and Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| Sure. Well, since my colleagues brought up commercial, so I feel like recode is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| thrown around like a four-letter word and is a little bit confusing. Recode is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| we, because I know a lot of people here for the first time, it's where we revised the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| zoning code for the first time in 50 years. And we allowed uses that were not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| previously before. We made it so you could have smaller lots, not you per se, but a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| could be on a smaller lot. So a lot of our older houses became legal on their current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| lots. We made it so that you could have carriage houses or garage apartments because that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| actually not allowed previously in the previous zoning code. But we also made it so that without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| a rezoning, you could add residential to commercial zones. And that is why you have the new apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| Now, they don't have fixed rents and there's a chapter in the state code that tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| we can't fix the rent unless they come to us and ask for some kind of subsidy. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| a whole new apartment complex across from the Home Depot there at Washington Pike that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| did not require rezoning and that's because of recode. The movie theater, as Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| Thomas pointed out, the movie theater has closed there at I-640 and Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| And yes, I've got complaints about the movie theater closing as well as the future redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| of that parcel. But it is also going to be several hundreds of new apartments. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| is the issue that we have here. We have 10 jugs of milk and 25 people trying to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| We have too many people. We have a lot of people that have come to move to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| New students, UT has increased double-digit their enrollment, but they didn't build housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| They rented hotels last year to put their students. They told their students to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| They didn't make a plan for where their students were going to go. So those students are willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| to pay $1,200 and up for an apartment. And that's directly impacted all of you because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| those landlords are now like, well, I don't have to house you. I can get $1,200 and up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| for a student. And I get it. I get it. But we can't go in. I am more than happy to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| down and have a conversation with whoever bought your complex. I'm not sure that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| will make a difference, but we can't legally tell them they can't raise it. But what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| want to say to my colleagues and people who want to talk about recode is there were successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| out of that. I'm getting two apartment complexes, or we are all getting two apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| in the areas that are no longer commercial in the fourth district. The recode changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| didn't get proposed until, I think it started in 2017, and they didn't go into effect until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| the beginning of 2019. And as we all know, 2020 was not a booming time for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| So we have this lag and delay. Maybe the answer is we should have revised our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| prior to 2018-2017. But none of us were up here then and weren't able to make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2480)|
| 0:41:31| any faster than it happened. So I think most people on this council have voted for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| new housing that we have coming in. Most of our votes have been unanimous. Mr. Bentley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| is there at the back of the room, not to throw him out there, but I think we have hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| of new units coming. We've increased many hundreds of new units coming in a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| other developments that KCDC does as well as Western Heights. And all of these new units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| come in and increase the volume of units that we have. And that's why we're looking at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| ways to increase the amount of housing that we have on existing vacant land, on commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| land. People are working from home on their Wi-Fi now. They're not going into these office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| buildings. So how can some of that stuff become residential? And we're not the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| city that's having this thing, this issue. People are moving to cities in larger numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| And so I think one of the things that we're missing from this is the personal factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| from your individual stories, like what was your rent changed to? And this isn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| the best forum to talk about that, but I'd love to talk to some of you about what got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| changed about your rent and your current situation and see how we can help you. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| I appreciate you guys bringing up the commercial, and I know of two success stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| We've got about two weeks more. What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2572)|

| 0:42:58| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to address a couple of different things. One, I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| was misunderstood when I was talking about my regrets with Recode. A lot of people did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| a lot of work. We were here till midnight, and we were just the, you know, the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| I know that staff, it was years and years of hard work. And I do not, I'm not insulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| that. I'm just saying there's more we could have done. And as I had said earlier, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| new on council. I wish I knew some of the things then that I know now that I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| pushed for. We did a lot of work. We did a lot of good work. So please understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| that's where I'm coming from. As far as building around corridors and where there's more infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| absolutely. That's absolutely something that's important. What I don't want is for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| be just focused on that because of the sacred cow, and I'm Hindu, so I can say that, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| sacred cow of single family homes. You know, I don't quite understand what tearing up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| fabric of a neighborhood is by adding density. That doesn't, I don't, I think it falls into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| nimbyism more than wrecking neighborhoods. But I'd love to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| I guarantee it does not generally fall into the area of nimbyism. I've lived in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| for over 30 years, and it's basically a working class neighborhood. And the opposition, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| I speak generally in my district, is when neighborhoods are concerned about over dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| development where the infrastructure there is not to support it. I don't get any indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| that it's based on people of lower economic status, color, race. I represent probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| the most diverse demographic in the city. If you take the Hispanics, there's Guatemalans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| in Lonsdale, there's African-Americans. And people, I think, are often too ready to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2704)|
| 0:45:17| the card of nimbyism when neighborhoods have valid objections to being overwhelmed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2717)|
| 0:45:28| density. And many, many times, I have been in issues where a developer comes in, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2728)|
| 0:45:38| want to put X amount of apartments in there. The neighborhood will meet with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| and say, we understand growth. We know that things are going to change, but scale it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| just a little bit. Scale it down so it won't overwhelm the schools. There's no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| that people can walk, et cetera. So, I would probably be about the first one actually to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2757)|
| 0:46:07| object if I thought some of my neighborhoods were basing some of their opposition on minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| discrimination or even more important, economic class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| I'm very, very happy to hear that that's been your experience. It has not been mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2778)|

| 0:46:36| this discussion and to people who are listening. First, in the second quarter of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| there's over 3,200 units of housing under construction. It's an all-time high, an all-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| high number of units under construction right now. This community is not waiting. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| not waiting. The private developing community is just trying to move forward as building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| housing because they want to meet that demand. As far as subsidized housing, KCDC, as some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| of you were able to attend the groundbreaking last week, they're going to, you know, transforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| Western is going to not only just transform that community and bring a new park and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| amenities and replace and update the existing housing, it's going to add 300 new homes at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| Western Heights. That's in process. We broke the ground last week. There's also over 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| new homes that have been added or in the process of being added at First Creek at Austin. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| we are, as a community, as a government and the private sector, working to fill this gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| right now. We're not waiting. I think it's also important, something we're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| we've already made some progress, is removing the sludge. You know, to the extent that developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| encounter slowdowns with our permitting process, with plans review and so forth, we are actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| listening and learning and adopting, adding staff, adding software, and making that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| easier. Because once someone has made that investment, you know, like the issue on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2887)|

| 0:48:21| is going to help the overall disparity between supply and demand. And also, I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| it's important to remember affordability is about the supply of housing and the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| of rent, but it's also about incomes. And so, you know, I think it's up to our employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| to also consider raising salaries for people because people, the labor market's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2920)|

| 0:49:44| My name's Tom Ruggles, live in District 2. Can everybody hear me alright? Awesome. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2984)|
| 0:49:59| you know, I like some of the discussion that's at least being had today and I don't doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| that you guys have made some efforts to build housing over the past few years, but it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| from my perspective that a lot of this housing has not really been focused around, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| low and low income folks. It has been not, I think maybe we have different definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| of what affordable housing is because to me, a $1,200 one bedroom apartment is not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| To me, you know, $900, $1,000, maybe that's a bit more affordable and if you look across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| the city of Knoxville right now, you can't find any apartments for that rate and if you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| you're going to be waiting for about a year at least to get those. So, we're really in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| middle of a crisis right now and so I just want to outline, you know, a couple of statistics about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| the nature of the crisis that we're in, particularly with the rental units and so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| you know, we've seen the average rent price for new leases go up about 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| over the past few years. The average rent in Knoxville is currently approaching $1,500 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| and to afford that reasonably, someone would have to make around $60,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| However, the median income of individuals in Knox County is only $36,000 a year and so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| average individual can't afford that. In fact, at $36,000 a year, $900 a month is right on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3082)|
| 0:51:34| line of affordability and so that's what we need to be targeting building and I'm just not seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| it happen. It seems to me that the use of the pilot program has been abused to build, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| middle to upper class housing. We're giving tax cuts to these rich developers when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| not giving back to the people in the community that really need it most. So, I would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| like to encourage the council here to, you know, utilize that program for lower income housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| also to take on some other ideas such as the one Ms. Parker laid forth and also things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| community land trusts where the community can have some say in what they're paying for their rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| because I understand the limitations that the council has here in regards to the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| which is absolute BS, but I know y'all can't do nothing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| And so, you know, me as a renter, I'm really starting to feel it. I know my friends in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| audience are really starting to feel it and there's some folks not in the room today that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| also feeling it. Our houseless population here in Knoxville has raised considerably over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| few years. Our brothers and sisters down there are really struggling and, you know, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| directly tied to what we're seeing with the rental increases. As the rents raise, as people can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| afford it, as they get kicked out of their homes, where are they going to go? They end up under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| bridge on Broadway down there and by going down there for the past two years handing out food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| every Sunday, I've watched the population there firsthand continue to rise, continue to rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| and it's really just sad to see and it makes me very concerned for my friends and my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| how soon is it going to be until we're in that boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| And so I'd like to encourage y'all to really start to think seriously and take this as a crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| that it is and we need to get this situation solved on a matter of, you know, a year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| rather than some of these longer-term solutions that we've been talking about. So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| I'll yield the rest of my time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| Next person signed up to speak on 9C is Rick Roach. Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3231)|
| 0:54:04| Thank you, Tom. Wow. See, I'm looking at it and I just thought I heard somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| kind of argue the opposite of what you see in item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| In order to change the base zoning classification of property located at 522 and 524 Victory Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| from our in for general residential neighborhood district to CG2 general commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| So we're taking units, potential units, off the residential side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3271)|
| 0:54:43| Reallocating for commercial purpose. At least that's what the request is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| Okay. That's the kind of, I'm going to use my word, shenanigans that has been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| continuously over the last 15 years and now is coming back to bite the city in the butt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| And we cannot, they cannot, the people I know cannot continue to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3308)|
| 0:55:19| I mean, listen, I've seen Mr. Bentley back there and we've had a few conversations in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| couple of years. Seema, my niece, you helped her maneuver. And I don't know what strings you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3325)|
| 0:55:37| pulled, but she wasn't in a position to move from a dangerous KCDC run facility to the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3337)|
| 0:55:49| Boston home scenario. I'll call it a scenario. And I'm going to be honest with you. That's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| face paint. That's just makeup. Okay. It solved her problem. But it illustrates what if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3358)|
| 0:56:08| know somebody, if you don't know somebody, you could be out on the street or you could be living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| a situation in which your life literally is in danger because the communities that, or a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| that you may live in, is a dangerous place to live. And that brings in other aspects of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3383)|
| 0:56:32| and livability in particular communities. The policing, the access to services, healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| in particular. Keep in mind, keep in mind, keep in mind, there's no medical services east of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3399)|
| 0:56:52| None. You can count, if you want to count Cherokee over on MLK, don't. Okay. It's nothing, comparatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3412)|
| 0:57:01| speaking. Nothing. So the lack of vision and the lack of foresight is coming back to bite Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3421)|
| 0:57:09| in the butt. And the only reason that it's happening is because most of the people are in the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| categories of poor or working poor, people of color, historically black communities. Okay. This is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3436)|
| 0:57:28| truth of the matter. I've been here. I've lived this my whole life. And I've seen it in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| across this country. I'm not, I'm not making this up. I've lived it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3454)|
| 0:57:44| Okay. And you all are like, well, it's a big problem. We got to get it solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Okay. We got to do something now. Okay. Yeah. Election time for a few of you. Election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3470)|
| 0:57:59| You better wake up. Okay. We're not putting up with the shenanigans anymore. We're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| Okay. We can't, it's not story time. Once upon a time, there was a whole community of black people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3486)|
| 0:58:15| and a whole community of working folk. And lo and behold, they were working hard. Then one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| the big bad landlord came and blew their houses down. Come on. All right. We are shooting ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3500)|
| 0:58:33| in the foot. And then we're hobbling over and saying, you know what? Since I got one bad foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| I might as well do the other one. That's it. I mean, that's all I got for you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3521)|
| 0:58:50| And I'm sorry to use such a messed up analogy, but this is crisis time, people. This is crisis time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3530)|
| 0:58:58| No more waterfront, anything of that nature, people. We need to concentrate on the people in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3538)|
| 0:59:07| Council, that concludes people signed up to speak on 9C. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| Just a brief comment that the agenda item that we're voting on actually-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| Can't hear you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| I'm sorry. That the agenda item, excuse me, the agenda item that we are now voting on actually adds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3568)|
| 0:59:37| multi-unit housing and density to this space. It doesn't turn it into a commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| So anybody that's in opposition to this because they think that it's depriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| opportunity for more housing is just mistaken. We're actually adding with this unit-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| Double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Double. And we're changing it from single family residence to multi-unit housing. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| everybody knows I'm an advocate of single family residences in many instances, but every piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| property is different. And I've surveyed this one, even though it's zoned single family residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| multi-use units are appropriate here. So I just don't want any misconception that may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3618)|
| 1:00:26| said that we're taking away residential property in this agenda item and turning it into commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| property. That's exactly almost the opposite of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| Thank you, Mayor. And thank you for that clarification for the audience, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| Thomas. I do think it's a valid concern and it's one that also that we should be mindful of because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3650)|
| 1:00:59| this is a mixed-use development with residential units, but we are changing the zoning that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| allow for other developments. So we're happy with this development, but we're changing the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| that could allow for other developments. So I think it's something for us to be mindful of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| And I wanted to echo some of the other thoughts shared. You know, if we don't want to float a bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3677)|
| 1:01:27| community land trusts are another strategy that we should consider and move forward with. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| have our Homemakers Program, and I've brought this up at meetings before, and I'm happy to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| the project on our agenda does restrict the income of the project to those making 80 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| area median income or below. And so I applaud that that is the focus of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3708)|
| 1:01:59| project that's coming before us. It's later in the agenda for those following along. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| what I did want to say is, you know, I believe we can move at a quicker pace, that we can invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| more money. I think currently the homes that are coming into the Homemakers Program are usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3731)|
| 1:02:26| blighted properties that we're putting up for sale. And I think that we can be a bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| proactive in identifying properties around the city that we can go ahead and acquire and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| into our quote-unquote land bank or the Homemakers Program. Other cities have—actually, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3760)|

| 1:04:40| that we take bold steps, that we do something different, and that we actually make it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| priority to ensure in a short timeline that we are producing the affordable housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3887)|

| 1:05:24| our residents to get pushed out of the city. And in order for us to prevent that, we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3924)|

| 1:06:32| just a reality, and that's a huge challenge for us. And we will keep working on it. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=3992)|

| 1:28:15| So I thought about it a little bit more, and then I just, I want to use a word that my good friend, our good friend, Rick Roach, uses a lot, and that's hoodoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5295)|
| 1:28:30| This survey, I want to make sure that you understand, the bus stops is a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5310)|
| 1:28:40| Yes, but it's just, it's indicative of what a lot of things that happen here in this room by some of you, who it appears to be good on the outside, but when you start peeling it away, and you get down to where it really is, it is hoodoo, it is hoodoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5320)|
| 1:29:10| Okay, now this, number one, I just want to point out that 64% of the respondents of the 725, out of how many, 300,000 folk that live in Knoxville, 300,000 plus, identified as, 64 identified as white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5350)|
| 1:29:40| And 27% identified themselves as black or African American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5380)|
| 1:29:55| I find that hard to believe, I really do, I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| The grant is $1,250,000, and it's called the Improved Transit Act, and it came into existence under our former governor, our former mayor, our former governor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5401)|
| 1:30:26| And it's to reduce congestion, increase ridership, and here's the key, promote economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5426)|
| 1:30:40| And it's just, it just speaks to everything that's going on here tonight, this here, nothing is, everything that you all do, everything that the government does, is related, you cannot separate one thing from another, and if you try to do that, no, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5440)|
| 1:31:00| So, to rehabilitate and renovate bus stops, it sounds really, really good, but you're going to be, what you're going to be doing is, you've got all these fancy new buses, and I think they're wonderful, electric and all that, of course, the poor little old trolleys are going away, and Mr. Frost, and Councilperson Ryder, you remember how much Thaxton School relied on those trolleys, especially that one that went down the street, and it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5460)|
| 1:31:30| I've prepared a strip which I can no longer called the strip because it resembles absolutely nothing that I remember being the strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5490)|
| 1:31:39| Again, who do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| At work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| But I just I just want everybody, we have to ask questions, we have to look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5503)|
| 1:31:52| deeper, we can't just accept, oh they're doing such a great thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| tonight have never been to a meeting and they know, they have to know that you have to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5519)|
| 1:32:07| your eyes and your ears open and you can't always, you can't always trust what you hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| It is a bunch of hoodoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| The next person standing up to speak is Rick Roach, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5538)|
| 1:32:35| Okay, yeah, the survey, I didn't think much about the survey, you know, and the funny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5555)|
| 1:32:44| thing was, again, as I stated earlier, the CAT was my primary mode of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5564)|
| 1:32:56| and I literally rode every route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Now, I took the 90 cross town, east and west, primarily east Knoxville routes, 31, 32, 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5579)|
| 1:33:11| 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| I'm going to give you a mentality overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5592)|
| 1:33:19| They were building the Superstop at the Kirkwood in front of Great Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| This was back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Come to the CAT station, I see former Mayor Brown there, hey, Dan, what's going on, man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| Hey, where are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| I'm going to the grand opening of the Kirkwood Superstop, okay, great, well, okay, boom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5614)|
| 1:33:41| well, a bunch of us are going to catch a bus, the minibus, out to the grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| I said, a bunch of you, yeah, city council folk, blah, blah, blah, dignitaries, blah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| blah, blah, blah, blah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| Now I'm riding the 34 and I had already made up my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| I'm getting off at Great Warner at the new Superstop because the old, that location had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5641)|
| 1:34:10| been moved over to the next block for the people who were riding the bus every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| And when they saw me get off, I said, why don't y'all come on and get, y'all get off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| where are you going, man, where are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| I said, what's going on right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| They're getting ready to have the grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| But see, none of the riders, the people who ride the bus, were notified about this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| were invited to come and celebrate the new Superstop grand opening, nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| So I got off the bus and walked on over, and lo and behold, I was treated like a red-headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| stepchild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| I wasn't supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Who are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| What do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Can we help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| And so when the mayor, Mayor Rejero, got there, hey, Rick, what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| Everybody kind of changed their tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Have to know somebody sometimes, and that's a damn shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| See, that's what we got going on here in Knoxville, you got to know somebody to get anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| It's a damn shame, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| That's the attitude that prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| So again, let's get back to this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| The survey, what's that, Jared Walker, is that the name of the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| They're from Portland, Oregon, surveying people in Knoxville, Tennessee, about their transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| needs and what would they like to see in their world-class transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| 725 respondents, I'm going to say it again, 725 respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| One route in Knoxville a year averages over 25,000 riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| And where are those people in this whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Because 46% of those folk that responded of those 725 don't ride the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5763)|
| 1:36:19| Y'all tell me, y'all tell me, and you're for it, y'all tell me, tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5779)|
| 1:36:27| And again, we got to look at campaign pictures of our mayor standing and pointing out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| 31, 32, 33, or not 32, but 33 and 34 bus stop, which is, oh, I'm proud to ride this bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| Well, that bus takes you east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| It ain't nothing going on east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Except a takeover, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| Again, I like my word, you know, a new word, hoodoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| Stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| The last person signed up to speak this item is Ms. Constance Everey, Ms. Everey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5826)|
| 1:37:17| Constance Everey, 37914, and the future mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee, 2023 election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5837)|
| 1:37:28| We are here because, yes, I am in total agreement with Ganey and Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| We know that Reimagined Cat is kind of the new initiative coming down the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| And as we have seen today with the housing, just like we saw with Hubert Smith, who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| really championed the issue around the Reimagined Cat programming, particularly relating to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| the trolley line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| The trolley line is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| It serves the elderly, disabled, and lower income members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Particularly what comes to mind to me is the Town View residence that lives up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| on the hill over by Green Magnet School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| This is one of their primary forms of transportation off the hill to connect directly to an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| Cat bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| So when you cut the trolley, you are literally leaving hundreds of residents without access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| to true form of public transportation to assist their various daily lifestyle and livelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| But this, again, is a trend of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| You know what I think is hilarious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| That if we were serious about bus renovation stops, then instead of blowing money on electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| buses, this is where you should have put the money towards actually putting funds toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| covering the bus stops and investing in safe bus stop locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| You did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| You instead chose to waste the money on electrical buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| That's what you did instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Now we fast forward, and you're cutting more bus lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| We have already heard from public that the 90 to 90, particularly, that bus line being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| cut killed so much access for job resource for so many demographics on the east and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| west side of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| And I want to continue to remind the voters the most critical piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| This administration had four years, four years to address housing, four years to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| transportation, four years to address affordability, four years to raise the livable wage of income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| for our city employees to an actual livable wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| Four years, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Do we want to go through four more years of this nonsense, or are we going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| as the voters and take real accountability for ourselves and our own actions by putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5963)|

| 1:39:30| I cannot say it enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5970)|

| 1:39:49| Please look at Indica Canyon donation financial records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| It reveals and tells so much who really supports this woman's administration and her campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| And as we already know, she has centered certain initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=5998)|

| 1:40:08| Meanwhile, we need a leader like Amelia Parker, as you heard today, who gave viable and real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| And what do we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| A bunch of babble and nonsense in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| And I cannot imagine the frustration this woman goes through daily dealing with such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| counsel and rubber stamp administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| And again, this is why we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| These people are up for re-election, including India herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| And I am running against her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| You know the difference between me and India?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| One, we are going to fully fund public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Two, we're going to expand public transportation by keeping the trolley, adding cable car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| and most importantly, the recent most renovation of the white rail system that even the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| itself right now is discussing an implementation for statewide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| So we do have real alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| We do have real options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| But the question is, voters, how much longer are you going to tolerate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| How much longer are you willing to put up with inefficiencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| How much longer are you willing to listen to data that clearly points out that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| was a disingenuous study and this was a disingenuous research to only support a narrative of selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| individuals who want to turn public transportation into a private enterprise of economical wealth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| When are we as the voters going to hold real accountability for ourselves and be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| for the elections of decisions we're making as voters for our future leaders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| So for the last time, Knoxville, I cannot say this enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| We are less than hours away, 12 hours or so away from the polls opening tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| And if you are serious about housing, if you are serious about public transportation, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| you are serious about the poverty, if you are serious about homelessness, if you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6097)|

| 1:41:45| are serious about a diversified, inclusive city that acknowledges every single voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| not a select few voices, then there's only one name you should be checking tomorrow and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| one name only, and that is Constance Embry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6114)|

| 1:42:07| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| I just had a question about this in terms of, so the money is a grant, we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| a match, about how many bus station…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| What am I coming up with, the improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| That was the word I was looking for, bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Will this actually rehabilitate and improve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Isaac Thorne is here, director of CAT, and he's ready to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| Mr. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| And can you tell me how many we have in total as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| How many bus stops we have in total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| About 1,300 bus stops in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Isaac Thorne, director of Knoxville Area Transit, it really varies on how much we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| actually do with this $1.25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| Every stop is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| So one stop may get a bus shelter, another stop may get just a semi-seater bench and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| a connector pad for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| So it really varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| I'd say on average, you could probably do most bus stops for $2,000 on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| And do we have a priority list of which ones we would use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Just while you're here, how are those bus stops determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Yeah, we determine those bus stops based on ridership at those stops, ADA accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6206)|
| 1:43:34| at those stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Also, we obviously want to put our resources towards the most highly used bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| So we start there and then we work our way down to accessibility issues at certain stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6221)|
| 1:43:48| So that's how we're determining the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| And then we have to disperse these bus shelters with equity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| So it's not just putting all these in the north side, south side, east, west, throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| the entire system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| I'm wondering if you've heard any feedback on the different infrastructure that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6248)|
| 1:44:16| implemented, like the lean-to's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| So there was obviously a big blow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| Are you talking about referring to Los Angeles and their shade stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| No, I don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| It was big on Twitter for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| We've looked at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| We have leaning rails right now in some of our shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| I think that's what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| But we're also looking at ways to make sure that we have natural shade at stops, trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| but also actual canopies to protect people from the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| We really like to have more trees at stops and along walkways and sidewalks as well because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| obviously heat is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| I think, just a heads up, I haven't gotten very good feedback on the lean-to's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| Some folks have found it a bit offensive even to not have the bench as an option and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6304)|
| 1:45:11| to have the lean-to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| I think as much as we can invest in a sheltered bench at as many stops as we can needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6313)|
| 1:45:22| be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| And I imagine you feel the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Yeah, as much as possible we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| You know, sometimes it's an easement requirement or whatnot, and that's what we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| at too with this list of priority stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Mr. Thorne, I think I heard you answer, Councilwoman Fugate, there are 1,300 stops, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6342)|
| 1:45:51| I heard you say you don't know how many stops you'll be able to work on, but you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| So what's the goal though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| I mean, when you guys were applying for the grant and having the discussion, was it maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| we'll do 300, maybe we'll do 200, maybe we'll do 5, maybe we'll do 1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| We're going to try to do 200 stops with this $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| We also have another $1.3 million that we're also trying to allocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| We were waiting for CAT reimagined to get approved before we start working on improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| these stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| We didn't want to start improving them before that work was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Of the 1,300 stops, I can't remember, how long have you been here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| You've done some great work with some of the stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| So of the 1,300 stops, how many of them are newly refurbished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| So just last year, we'd done 30, and I think the year before that, we did maybe 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| So 45 are newer stops with either a bus shelter or actual new infrastructure at a bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6404)|
| 1:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| So making small dents in the grant hopefully is to make a larger dent, but still a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| We are trying to make a lot of headway over the next two years, trying to do anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| from really 50 stops a year over the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| It just takes a lot of time because we have to go through an A&E, architectural and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| each one of these stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Do we need an easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6431)|

| 1:47:26| I just want to mention that as part of the tree canopy master plan, I think there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| opportunity there for those two programs to overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| We can put trees around bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| It's another bit of hospitality for bus riders, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| And I meant to mention this in my opening remarks, but I wanted to give a summary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| CAT Reimagined because I think we've heard a lot about that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Last week, the KTA board approved a resolution to affirm the new network that was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| by CAT Reimagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| And despite some tradeoffs, the new network will allow the average person to reach 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| more jobs within 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| It will be 24% more access to jobs for those below the poverty line, 26% more access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| jobs for those people of color, 22% more access to jobs for people without a car, new 15-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| routes and Sunday service that is very similar to Saturday service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| So the surveys on the front end of this, where we hired extra staff and consultants to ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| the bus and make sure that the Knoxville population was well represented, had a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| And so what you're going to get out of CAT Reimagined next year is a faster commute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| bottom line, and particularly for those people who need it most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| So I'm really proud of the work that your staff has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| I think it's something that I've tried to update the council on along the way, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| we've got is a good result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| Like I said, it's not without tradeoffs, and we're not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| So the CAT, KTA board will vote later this year or early next on the actual bus stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| and the times associated with those, which is really important considering we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| to try to attack more bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| So there's more work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| But I believe the anticipated new network will be live next summer, end of next summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| August of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| August 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| So Knoxville residents who ride the bus frequently will have a faster commute as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6571)|
| 1:49:39| So I wanted to say a thank you for the excellent work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Just wanted to commend you on the Reimagination CAT process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| You took your time on it, which was longer than a lot of projects take when they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| And I know you gave multiple opportunities for people to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| You went to different parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| There was posted online where they could have input that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| And it seemed to me like you made every effort you could to have people to input and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| And I know various instances where your staff and the consulting team took those instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6623)|
| 1:50:32| to heart and made changes and some tweaks based on what you were getting from input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| So it definitely wasn't an inflexible process and I appreciate kind of the nimbleness that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| your staff did to try to accommodate the input that you were getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| And also, as Council Member Smith pointed out, this is still an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| Once we get it in place, there has been tradeoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| But hopefully this will kind of stabilize the existing bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| And based on that, we can expand out and maybe get into some areas that aren't served now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6668)|
| 1:51:15| So I appreciate no process is perfect, but I certainly appreciate all the effort that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| your staff put in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| I'll just add that I appreciate Director Thorns and his staff's work on CAT Reimagined and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6686)|
| 1:51:34| just on CAT's general services every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| I want to thank the members of the KTA Board who have been doing their volunteer work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6699)|

| 1:51:47| I also want to thank this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| We budget $14 million a year in local dollars to keep CAT operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| And that's a big amount and it's important to the people of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| It connects people to opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| I also want to just say that not only does CAT connect people to jobs, CAT has jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=6721)|

| 2:11:31| Thank you, Mayor. Is the developer here by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7891)|
| 2:11:40| Mr. Mullins is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| Yes, Mr. Mullins, could you tell us a little bit about what the plans are for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| Sure. This is a property that is currently zoned RN1. There is RN5 to the west, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7914)|
| 2:12:03| RN4 also to the west, RN3 to the south, and RN6 to the southeast. This is actually a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7923)|
| 2:12:10| of property that's between a single-family residential and an existing apartment. RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| was what we considered to be a good buffer zone. It would allow a greater mix and density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7935)|
| 2:12:22| of potentially some townhomes, duplexes, even single-family, but would not allow apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| And so I thought it would be a good transition zone from the existing apartments, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| owned by the same developer, to the single-family residential neighborhood. I have been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| since we filed the application with the London's Drive Community Association. I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| them about, you know, we don't have a development plan in place. We don't know exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| type of housing we're going to put on there. We'd probably look at townhouses first, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| that depends on kind of doing the engineering once we know we have the zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| But, you know, they feel better knowing that apartments can't go there, and they also feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| better knowing that the HP overlay will still stay in place, and that, you know, there'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| have to be a development plan, moving through planning commission, some type of concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| at that time. So that's really what we're doing. We don't have anything specific in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| mind, but we're looking at some type of, you know, medium-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| Okay. I just wanted to make sure that there had been some discussions with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| I appreciate you and applaud you for doing that in advance. The only other piece of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| that I was thinking about is looking at the property. It looks like there are some mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| trees that are there between where the neighborhood is and the property that you're looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| develop. Are there plans to try to keep some of those mature trees and have that as a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| with the neighborhood? As much as possible, yes. I mean, there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| you know, landscaping requirements and buffer requirements for what will go in there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| so whenever you can keep existing vegetation and not remove it, that's more beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| both to the neighborhood and for the developer not having to replant and go through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| expense. I know, though, there's been quite a bit of deadfall in that area as well, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| that's been something the developer's actually been working with the neighbors that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| you know, contiguous there and helping clean that up as it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8045)|

| 2:15:47| Sure. There's a little bit of history to this. This was originally a planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8147)|
| 2:15:53| and the front portion of the property, there was a development plan approved at the time that the now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8153)|
| 2:16:01| Addison Apartments to the north were developed, using this as kind of a commercial use there under the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| RP1 zone. Sometime between 1998 and 2001, the entire site was graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8167)|
| 2:16:14| All the utilities and infrastructure were there to put two little shopping areas with a single entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| They developed one and built out the grading, the utilities, the plumbing. Everything was laid out for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| second one, but they never did develop that one, and that development plan had expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| And so, you know, it kind of happened around 2008 when the Great Recession hit, and so that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| laid dormant for a while. The developer now intends to complete the commercial development under the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| plans, but since those plans had expired and recode had intervened, we needed to look at changing the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| ordinance, and CG1 is kind of the predominant commercial zone along that corridor, and it would allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| not to have to change, rip up any of the existing infrastructure they built for the second pad and use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| footprint for the development instead of the CG2, which would then force that build two zone issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8223)|
| 2:17:10| This is something that we worked with, you know, city engineering and planning about whether or not we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| even continue to do under the existing RP zone, and they said no, we'd prefer the CG1 zoning instead of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| under the RP1 zone and use the existing zoning, but staff recommended it. It was passed unanimously on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8242)|
| 2:17:30| I don't see any objection to the CG zoning here at all. The only concern I have is that you're going from CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8250)|
| 2:17:39| which has design standards, to CG1, which does not have any design standards at all, and so what my question to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| you is, you know, I know you're doing some renovations here with this building. What are you planning on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| design for the building? The thing that I'm really looking at here is I don't want to see any more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8274)|
| 2:18:02| rear-facing buildings to the street or not having any transparency or windows at the street level, and when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8282)|
| 2:18:12| don't have any design standards, it gives me a lot of concern, so I just wanted to make sure I had a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8292)|
| 2:18:18| picture of what you were going to do. Well, and if you look at what's already developed there on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| I mean, it's kind of a sister to that, which, you know, is, you know, front-facing. There's parking in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8304)|
| 2:18:30| but, you know, there's, you know, it's a different components can be leased out to different commercial, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| windows and, you know, office uses, things of that. I think, I'm trying to remember what's out there now, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8316)|
| 2:18:43| but I think there's a driving school and there's a little mini-mart right there, a little convenience store, and so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| looking at similar type of development, but, you know, that would be facing the street, not facing the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8329)|
| 2:18:56| properties behind. There's quite a bit of topography. There's a berm there between the apartments and this, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| kind of the reason why it was a natural separation between the residential and then the commercial-facing paper mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| And certainly looking at it, I would have expected that, but you can see my concern while I'm asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| Absolutely, and again, it's the trade-off between, you know, the build-to zones and the design standards on this, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| you know, this one is, I think, a little less controversial than some we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| I understand. And so, I guess my next question is for Director Brooks. I know Council had a workshop back in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8366)|
| 2:19:32| where we talked about this again with not having any design standards in CG1. You know, we have design standards in CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8372)|
| 2:19:41| and 3. You know, they're not particularly restrictive, but I think it definitely gives me a lot of concern when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8381)|
| 2:19:50| don't have any design standards at all. And it's been mentioned before, would it be helpful to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| if a resolution was brought asking for you to look into doing design standards for CG1? Because I know we've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8397)|
| 2:20:04| before, but we haven't really seen any movement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| Yes. If the Administration and Council would like for us to take a closer look at CG1 and consider adding design standards to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| we would need some direction on that. As you all know, we still have potential pending amendments to CG2 and CG3 that are underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8417)|
| 2:20:30| It could be something that we start to look at as part of that, but more preferably we would want to do that in a separate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8430)|

| 2:23:54| just, I think what you're doing here is you've maybe got some existing property there where you're already operating and you're wanting to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8634)|
| 2:24:01| the previously approved planned district, maybe to give yourself some flexibility to add some more buildings for some additional units. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8641)|
| 2:24:10| basically right? That is correct. Okay. And I just wanted to get a sense for where you were with that. Just for everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8650)|
| 2:24:19| recollection on council, but then also the public, this is an example of transparency where originally the request that we were getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8659)|
| 2:24:26| for council was to just remove these automatically, and instead what we're asking folks to do is exactly what you're doing, is coming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8666)|
| 2:24:35| asking for it to be removed so we can go through a public process. So I'm very pleased that we're continuing to do that. And so thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| you for doing that. And then can you tell us a little bit about the additional units you're looking at adding? Historically, this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8683)|
| 2:24:50| probably two different properties, and one of them had a historic overlay, a residential overlay, which had a certain number of units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8690)|
| 2:24:59| acre. And at some point, and this goes back probably at least 25 years, at some point these were combined. The property has a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8699)|
| 2:25:11| easement for TVA power lines coming through, and the ownership that we have of that property, we're going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8711)|
| 2:25:19| lot of that. And so now I would like to probably combine the properties totally and then develop one additional building on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8719)|

| 2:29:17| building is a large bank building out on Kingston Pike near the intersection of Pellissippi Parkway. It was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8957)|
| 2:29:27| constructed by SunTrust, well, Third National and then SunTrust last year, well, actually earlier this year, Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8967)|
| 2:29:36| Commerce Bank bought the building. The plans for the building are to leave it exactly as a bank. I mean, if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8976)|
| 2:29:43| the building, it's a bank. They are facelifting the very entrance right now to mimic the building that they constructed at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8983)|
| 2:29:54| the intersection at Kingston Pike and North Shore Drive. The reason for the rezoning is that SunTrust Bank, or SunTrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=8994)|
| 2:30:03| contains eight letters. Mountain Commerce contains 16. And so, under the existing zoning, we were rezoning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9003)|
| 2:30:12| building, restricted on the sign, and getting Mountain Commerce Bank on the building large enough to actually read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9012)|
| 2:30:20| violated the existing sign ordinance for that zoning. So, we asked for a zoning change basically to allow signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9020)|
| 2:30:29| Okay. And so, you're not going to change the orientation of the building or where the entrance is or any of that? You're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9029)|
| 2:30:35| doing a facelift to the entrance? Just the entrance. That's it. There's no window changes or anything. Well, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| and the same reason I'm asking you about this is the one from before. This is going to CG1, which doesn't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| design standards. I drive by the building. I was pretty sure you weren't going to be making any major changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9048)|
| 2:30:55| orientation of the building. But again, there's no design standards in CG1. Correct. So, I need to ask you that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| because I don't want to see any more rear-facing buildings or buildings without transparency or windows facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| So, it's a major problem that we need to get fixed. And that's not your issue. That's our issue and something we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| address. But I appreciate you telling us what's going on there. Director Brooks, again, this is being raised again. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9074)|
| 2:31:25| another resolution needs to be brought, which I can bring, to address this. But since I already addressed that last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9085)|

| 2:31:56| additional input and dialogue. And the Planning Commission has requested that staff present a revised timeline for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9116)|

| 2:32:11| that timeline to Planning Commission in September. I know just from the workshop and the discussion, there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| interest in making sure we encourage that and preserve those pedestrian commercial corridors. So, I think that's something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| should be looking at, too. I do think the design standards piece needs to be separated from that, because I could see a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9143)|
| 2:32:29| more discussion being needed and stakeholders being found and discussed with about the CG2, CG3 issue. But I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9149)|

| 2:36:53| so if you caught my age, that's up until now. I was born at the University of Tennessee Hospital. I'm a student of the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9413)|
| 2:37:09| of Tennessee College. There's been a lot of emotion. Just standing here seeing you all, I'm already emotional because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9429)|
| 2:37:16| been a really tough month. And I think that some of you don't fully understand the full picture of what we went through. Just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9436)|
| 2:37:32| the past week or so, two weeks or so, I think it's normal to have gradual rent increases. That's something everyone's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9452)|
| 2:37:39| accustomed to now, year by year, right? So I signed my lease in 2022 for $750 at Tanglewood. It was perfect. That's a steal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9459)|

| 2:38:14| tonight, rent's not cheap in Knoxville, and it's not getting any cheaper. So we were really, really happy to find what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9494)|
| 2:38:23| did. When I re-signed in 2023, I was kind of shocked at my renewal. I had expected an increase. I didn't expect a 12%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9503)|
| 2:38:30| increase. So my rent renewal re-sign in the beginning of this year was for $850. I still re-sign that. That's still a deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9510)|

| 2:39:14| that my $850 lease is now going to be $1,400, and I'm expected to pay that on renewal in October. It's July. I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9554)|
| 2:39:32| that kind of income as a student and a full-time worker. It's $20,000 extra that I would have to make a year in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9572)|

| 2:40:35| flying off the cusp now because I'm emotional, which I didn't expect to be, but hey. Thank you. But really, I've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9635)|

| 2:41:15| already said, and I plan to take you all to take seriously, bold action on something here around Knoxville because I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=9675)|

| 2:50:08| was an experiment. There were cameras in the cooler and some kind of other equipment in the cooler. When we have the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10208)|
| 2:50:23| department, the police department, the coroner, the motor vehicle department, because I've talked to all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10223)|
| 2:50:30| people, KUB, and today, well this week, I realized it was even the church. Now the church, I don't know if they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10230)|
| 2:50:42| that their name was used or they went along with it. Captain, Fire Captain Parton this year stated that it was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| experiment. We cannot people have an experiment and this man accused of burning the store. My father's store was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10249)|
| 2:51:01| burned, and we knew the city stole it. But we never knew that the city would come in that store and burn it. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10261)|
| 2:51:08| story is provable. And the coroner, Locke Miller, now I'm here in Constance Avery, she stayed at tomorrow's election. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10268)|
| 2:51:26| I'm asking the mayor to ask the fire department, in front of everybody here, to ask the question, who burned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10286)|
| 2:51:33| store? And I think everybody here would want to hear that answer. Huh? Ask them. Who burned that store? We live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10293)|
| 2:51:47| America. Who would have thought that the city would go in their store and burn it? You make sure that these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10307)|
| 2:51:54| don't have a son or a daughter to come back at you. And I'll be back again. I want to check for my father's store. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10314)|
| 2:52:11| knew in 1992-93 that that store was burned, was stolen by the city. It was an explosive device because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10331)|
| 2:52:18| unexplained how that fire went. And I'm going to ask you one more time, in front of these people, to ask Stan over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10338)|
| 2:52:28| there, who burned that store? India Gourley or the city? We're waiting. Are we not waiting, people? Are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10348)|
| 2:52:35| Why are you not asking? You deep down know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10355)|
| 2:52:48| Your time is up, Mr. Zaida. Next person signed out to speak is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10368)|
| 2:52:55| Mr. Zaida, thank you very much. Just members of the audience who are listening, his questions have been answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10375)|
| 2:53:06| through the law department many years ago. Mr. Tom Ruggles, you're signed up to speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10386)|
| 2:53:25| My name is Tom Ruggles. I live in District 2 of Knoxville. I'll keep this very short and sweet because I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10405)|
| 2:53:33| folks have already relayed all the points I wanted to make today. But obviously you all have heard of what's occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| over at the Tanglewood Apartments. And that is not a particularly unique occurrence. Things like that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10420)|
| 2:53:47| at other places when new rent and leases come up. In my personal situation, where I rent at, it hasn't been as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10427)|
| 2:53:58| egregious of an increase. But when I moved here three years ago, I was paying about $780. Now I'm paying $1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10438)|
| 2:54:07| So over the course of three years, it's gone up somewhere around 35 percent. And my story is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10447)|
| 2:54:14| And my story is the same as many other folks here in the city of Knoxville. So I just wanted to reach out to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10454)|
| 2:54:21| the renters here in Knoxville and know that we really need to stand together in solidarity, not only with our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10461)|
| 2:54:28| at Tanglewood, but also amongst ourselves. Because it's time that we tried to push back against what's being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10468)|
| 2:54:35| to this city as far as the rent increases, and that we also would appreciate some help from this body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10475)|
| 2:54:44| And I'll yield the rest of my time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10484)|
| 2:54:48| Thank you. Next person to sign up is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10488)|
| 2:54:55| Rick Roach, Knoxville. It's a public forum. It's a lot on my mind. But we'll deal with what was brought up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10495)|
| 2:55:02| Rick Roach, Knoxville. It's a public forum. It's a lot on my mind. But we'll deal with what was brought up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10502)|
| 2:55:15| Tanglewood Apartments, all the ran properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| This is about whether or not you all want, as a body, as an elected body, to actually stand together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10522)|
| 2:55:31| and actually empower the people that voted for you. Now, keep in mind, Knoxville has a really poor record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10531)|
| 2:55:40| And I've reminded, when I've talked to some of these folks, I've reminded them about that poor record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10540)|
| 2:55:46| And it has to do with voting. Somebody can help me with the total numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10546)|
| 2:55:52| How many registered voters do we have in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10552)|
| 2:55:59| That actually vote. And there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| So, either people are thoroughly discouraged from participating in the electoral process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10565)|
| 2:56:14| they don't give a damn, or, you know, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10574)|
| 2:56:21| You know, one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| Now, of that 25%, I'm going to say something that may tick a lot of people off, but of that 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| I guarantee you most of them don't have neighborly feelings toward their fellow electors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| Okay. Let's be honest about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10601)|
| 2:56:47| There is a populist that you all cater to and pump everybody up about, and they jump on that bandwagon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10607)|
| 2:56:56| So when it comes time to get down to the nitty gritty and come up with solutions for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10616)|
| 2:57:02| when you all pump them up, when you all blow smoke up there, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10622)|
| 2:57:08| Guess what happens? They buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| Among the populists. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10634)|
| 2:57:20| And you find that people, because they are misinformed and don't know what the deal is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10640)|
| 2:57:27| they end up doing something that's pretty predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10647)|
| 2:57:33| They engage in conflict, again, with their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10653)|
| 2:57:39| With their own best interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10659)|
| 2:57:45| And I think some of you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| And you misrepresent what the real issues are and how some of these issues can be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| Because we know that in the process of you all running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| you don't thoroughly say what the situation really is. And you know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10683)|
| 2:58:11| One of the good things that happened to me, when I had people come to me and ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10691)|
| 2:58:17| I didn't go and seek it, they asked me to serve on advisory committees, Neighborhood Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10703)|
| 2:58:29| And I participated in that empowerment zone process where millions of dollars was supposed to be flooding into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10709)|
| 2:58:35| these designated empowerment zones. And there's truly only, there's two zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10715)|
| 2:58:41| that just happen to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10721)|
| 2:58:47| still in need of empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| All this money came flowing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| Y'all do the, y'all do, y'all go back and look. Go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10735)|
| 2:59:01| East Knoxville, the east zone, Mechanicsville-Lonsdale, part of that west zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10741)|
| 2:59:07| okay, empowerment zone. Millions of dollars supposed to come through. You know what, you know what we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| We couldn't even get a library in the east zone. Because we had to, we couldn't get the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10753)|
| 2:59:19| to support us in that effort. Couldn't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10759)|
| 2:59:25| Because the Knox County government was over the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10765)|
| 2:59:31| Okay? And we couldn't get any support. We got a grocery store built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10771)|
| 2:59:37| and now that grocery store is a church. And we still have the largest food desert in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10777)|
| 2:59:43| From Summit all the way out to the split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| Okay? Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10789)|
| 2:59:55| Track record sucks, you guys. Your track record sucks. You gotta correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10795)|
| 3:00:01| Okay, next person signed up to speak is Glory Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10801)|
| 3:00:07| Ms. Ledbetter, if you could state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10807)|
| 3:00:13| Thank you. My name is Glory Ledbetter. I live at 4619 Sunflower Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| 37909, so here in Knoxville, District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| I have lived here in Knoxville for the last four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10825)|
| 3:00:32| after returning home from New England. And I have lived here the whole life before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10832)|
| 3:00:38| And whenever I was in New England, people would always ask me like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| oh, how do you like it here? You're gonna stay here, right? And I would be like, no way!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10844)|
| 3:00:50| Why would I want to? Knoxville is great! It's my home. It's a magical place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| The only surprise that we have here to the land is Appalachians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10856)|
| 3:01:02| So I came back to fulfill my dreams, got a job, looked at apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| did the responsible thing and picked an apartment below my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10868)|
| 3:01:14| And, you know, obviously there's a lot of things that are outside of you guys' control and that's totally understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10874)|
| 3:01:20| But as a small business owner who's working a job to support that dream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10880)|
| 3:01:26| invest in those things, do all the right things, it's really discouraging to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| have that dream taken away. And like Hannah was saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| it's strangely emotional, but it makes so much sense. I mean, housing is such a basic human need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| So, you know, I've had no complaints actually about RAND.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10905)|
| 3:01:53| They've managed our property fairly well, but there have been the increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10913)|
| 3:01:59| So when I signed my lease in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10919)|
| 3:02:05| it was $790 a month, which is pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10925)|
| 3:02:11| My rent, they have offered me my new lease come October for $1116,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10931)|
| 3:02:17| so $1,116 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10937)|
| 3:02:23| So over the course of four years, my rent has risen 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10943)|
| 3:02:29| And as a small business owner, I can't go to my boss to ask for a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| And no one would be able to get a 30% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10956)|
| 3:02:49| And I know you mean so well by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10969)|
| 3:02:55| Workers have more power now to negotiate for wages than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10975)|
| 3:03:02| And like I said, I know your hands are tied when it comes to rate control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10982)|
| 3:03:15| but I have firm belief that when we work together, when we cooperate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=10995)|
| 3:03:21| when we're creative, there are solutions. There are possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11001)|
| 3:03:28| Because I also agree that increasing the supply will do a lot of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11008)|
| 3:03:34| But I fall in that missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| I make too much to apply for any of the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| I make too little to qualify for a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| And as a single woman, I don't have a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| So I fall in the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11028)|
| 3:03:55| And so I have made the unfortunate decision that I'm going to have to leave Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11035)|
| 3:04:04| And I will not be signing my lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230808?start=11044)|
