| 0:01:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Nine members are present, so we do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| I would like to begin by asking that we add Resolution R-11-8-906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| This has to do with funding for the schools capital program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| I would also ask that Item Number 29 be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| Yes, sir, if you could give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Russ Oaks, 912 South Gay Street, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| I would like to withdraw Item Number 5 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| That's Resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| We need to do some additional research around the technology associated with that grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| and anticipate bringing that back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Yes, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Item 705 is to be added, and that is Phase 1 of Knox Blount Greenway, which you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| There are just some changes to state requirements there that we need to bring that forward again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| Let me ask you just a quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Items 21 through 24, it has local matching funds locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| Those are budgeted funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Yes, those are within our budget now between capital and amusement tax, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Any other items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| Yes, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| I mean, Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Item Number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Put your mic down, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Put your mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Pretty loud, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Item Number 33, the Trustee's Office would like to add that, Number 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Are there any other adjustments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| Mr. Chairman, if I could, I received, I was contacted by our Human Resources Director relative to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=188)|
| 0:03:17| that's going to be actually second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| It's Number 34, 0117-101, and Ms. Fogerson, I think, has a very good point in terms of amending that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=201)|
| 0:03:31| and I don't think the amendment is such that it would require a second or a new revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| I think we can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| But in a nutshell, what she's recommended, instead of it merely reading that someone will have to report their activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| to his or her supervisor, she believes it should read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| reporting to one supervisor or department director or the Human Resources Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| And I think her logic is, in the event that the supervisor is, in fact, the one involved in the wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| it gives you the option to report it to a director, and if you're not comfortable with that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| the Human Resources Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| I don't think that's a substantial change, but I think it's one that may be worth your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| But I'll defer to the wisdom of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| When we get there, we can discuss that and make an amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| I would like to make one addition and then one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| The clarification is for the Allet Drive roadway construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| Let me see if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Is that number nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| I think it may be, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Because there were some blanks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| That is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| We had to delay the bid due to some questions, but I do have the information I'd like to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| APAC, A-P-A-C dash Atlantic Incorporated is the apparent low bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| And the contract amount, which I've sent a copy of the contract to Jill and Joey as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| that will be in your all's packet next week, is $3,073,604.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=301)|
| 0:05:10| What's the four cents for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| And the other one, I would like to add one that the developer's engineer had asked us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| Out at Mercy North, we would like to add a consideration of a new county road for Danaher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| D-A-N-N-A-H-E-R Drive, located in the Danaher Place subdivision, and that's in District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=327)|
| 0:05:41| Is that one already on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| That's an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| That's an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Is it a road name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| It's actually an acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| It's the road to the hospital that goes from Connor Road to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| So we don't have any paperwork on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I have emailed it to Joey and Jill, so it will be in the packet for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| We'll go ahead and put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| We'll probably send it on without recommendation so we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| But we can go ahead and put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| If not, do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added, delete what needs to be deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| I have a suggested consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| And, of course, feel free to take anything off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Numbers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=387)|
| 0:06:56| 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=416)|
| 0:07:20| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=440)|
| 0:07:29| Anybody like anything pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I guess as a comment, could you, as a favor maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| once you determine the consent agenda be greater, somehow pulse that that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| We're not, you know, kind of rushing through seeing if we have a small issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| or an item associated with an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| So I'd ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| And the reason I'm asking is I guess based on the conversation of Item 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| I may have an issue with 10 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Would you like those removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| I'd say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| I'll try to get it all in in 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| So we'll pull Number 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Commissioner Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| I believe the trustee would like to have that sent on without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| because they're still tweaking a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| We'll pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| We'll send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Well, we'll take it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| So do I hear a motion that we accept those as consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| I motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| And there's a motion to make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| So those will be sent on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| So, Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Consideration of approval of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| On page 2, item number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| approving a construction contract with APAC Atlantic in the amount of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| for the outer drive expansion project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| the bid opening has been delayed until August 2, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| upon award of contractor and price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| This is resolution 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Our budgeted amount was $2.8 million, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Yes, sir, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I probably need to clarify a little bit there, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| because the actual contract that you see there for $3,073,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| that includes water, sewer, and gas relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| So the actual roadway construction component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| the part that Knox County will be responsible for, is $2,247,928.24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=605)|
| 0:10:15| The remainder of that amount, which is in part about $825,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| will be fully reimbursed to Knox County by KUB and First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| So is this contract in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| Or, I mean, has this, you had mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| and I don't want to misquote you, but you said that the apparent winner was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Could you describe what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| APAC Atlantic was the apparent low bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| so they do have the contract at $3,073,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| They have two components of their bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| One is for roadway items that obviously Knox County will be paying for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| and the other, the $825,000, is for the water and sewer and gas relocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| that we will be reimbursed for by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Those agreements, due to the lateness of this bid opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| we were not able to get on commission's agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| So in September of next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| you will see two agreements for the reimbursement of that $825,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| one from KUB and one from First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| And then that was kind of leading into my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| with these other items that we put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| So those items, that's additional dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| those items are coming from the 2.2 to get up to the budget amount of 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Those are right-of-way acquisition dollars that were funded separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| in the more or less the land acquisition phase of that versus the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| So those are dollars that had been previously budgeted in another account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| But I guess, was that budgeted under what we passed in this last year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| or was that budgeted under a whole different engineering account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| I guess is my question, or in the previous years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| It was both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| It was both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| The general roadway improvements budget we had last year was for $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| That went to pay for some of the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| but the right-of-way cost in items 10, 11, and 12, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| were funded previously out of previous fiscal year budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Jim, the total budget for it, you were looking over $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| but you say $825,000, KUB is going to reimburse you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| so we're down to $2.2 million of our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Where we budgeted $2.8 million, that leaves us $600,000 extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| What do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Are you using that for paving other parts of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| What do we use with the excess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Well, actually, that $2.8 million was an engineer's estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| so that's not like actual hard dollars that we have in that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| There will be a little bit left over, but it won't be the $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| It will be probably a couple hundred thousand dollars that we'll keep in the account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| in the event contingencies or change orders are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| You've got extras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| I've got suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| It stays in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| There's one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Commissioner McKenzie voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=818)|
| 0:13:51| On page 4, item number 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| approval of lease agreement in a monthly rental amount of $3,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| with Jefferson Federal Bank for Space, known as the Hardy Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| located at 2202 Martin Luther King Avenue for a four-year term beginning July 1, 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| and ending June 30, 2015, Resolution 604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Dr. Buchanan, what's the current rent that we've been paying to whoever we've been paying it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| We're currently paying it to Jefferson Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| I'm sorry, Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| We're paying Jefferson Federal $3,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| It was supposed to go up to $4,000, but when we talked with them about the rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| they kept it at the same rate for the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| When we brought Cherokee in, is it bringing the visits up, the patient count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Our patient count up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Well, overall, I mean, Cherokee is part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Their patient counts, I believe, are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Our patient counts are pretty much remaining flat at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| We talked about different options for how we can do other things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| One idea we've floated and probably will do is some diabetes education out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| We already have a program to help people with their meds and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| So that's going to be revenue neutral for the county to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| We've got the space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| So we'll probably be offering that with some regularity at that location for people in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| I think she answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| I just want to be sure this was a continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| How long have you been at that address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| It was before Mark left, and it was more than two years, probably four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| We had a ten-year lease agreement, and we renegotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| It was supposed to go up to the $4,000, and so we talked to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| The property is currently on the market, but the bank has no intentions of removing the tenant, which is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| I'm betting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| I don't know for sure, but I'm betting this four years will probably take it to the ten-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| They've been there about six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| I couldn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| But that just keeps us at this rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| The contract, as previously written, was escalating in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Martha, this may be a question for you, or you hold one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| This $3,800, what's the square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| What are we paying a square foot for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| What are we getting out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Jason may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Or what's the square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| I'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I don't know the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| I've just seen what the first district is bringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1007)|

| 0:16:51| I'm with the Knox County Health Department, 140 Danron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I think the square footage is right around in between 4,500 to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I'll figure it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1022)|

| 0:17:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| On page six, item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| designating and preparing funds from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| for various funds in Department's Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| I'll second it so John can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| John, would you come forward, please, and brief us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| John Troyer from 100 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I guess what these departments are asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| what the finance department is asking for on their behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| is permission to carry forward funds that were approved in last fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| and not spent and into this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| Included in that is trustee's office for a number of office equipment items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| the health department for equipment and some renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| We do have four items on the community grants, which they'll be contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| which were not included in the budget as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| And now that funding is available, we'd like to include those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| That includes the Sertoma Center for $15,000, Cerebral Palsy Center for $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Shangri-La Therapeutic Academy of Writing for $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| the Alzheimer's Association for $12,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and East Tennessee Technology Access Center for $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| So these are items that were considered in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Cuts had to be made in order to make it balanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| and now that we're going through the closing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| there were some funds identified as available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Also, the biggest piece of this is we've got some money held on behalf of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| for engineering public works and do some work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| and 9-1-1 is asking for some uninterrupted power supply money for the amount of $165,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1145)|
| 0:19:15| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| What happened to the cerebral palsy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| I know Commissioner Hammond and there was some discussion about that during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| What do we end up with them and giving them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| If memory serves, I think I'd probably be better served to double check this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| but I think the number was $5,000, and this would be an additional $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| So I guess my question is, would that make them whole on what the original ask was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| where they ended up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I don't mind an answer next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| I think I need to check that, and I'll give you the answer on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| And then I guess my second question is, how was this vetted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Did you take the highest numbers from the citizens review panel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1203)|
| 0:20:12| Did you divide it across agencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| I'm trying to understand how we came to these entities getting these additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| These were items that were considered during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and were items that were intended and wanted to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| but were not able to be included because cuts just had to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| But there was a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I guess there were a lot of things that were, and we all talked about these great entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| great causes, but we couldn't fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| I'm just wondering how we came to choose these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| How you all came to choose these as opposed to the organized process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| that yielded the entities that were budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| And this was all a part of the organized process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| It's just part of, I guess, just part of the difficult decisions at the cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| And, okay, there's a certain group that come from the panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| and there's a certain group that are included in the contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| and these would be included in the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| Maybe Grant is a better person to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Again, we talked about there was a line, and everyone below the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| and these entities were not funded, and everyone above the line were funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| What was the process that yielded this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Did we pick one from each category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Are these the next highest winners or losers that we brought in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| Was it more random than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| I think Grant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Do you want to add something to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Grant Rosenberg, Director of Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| The citizen review panels are a committee that advises the mayor on budget recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| These are the mayor's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Now, they're after the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| but, again, these are dollars that became available after the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| These are the mayor's recommendations for funding based on citizen review panel recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| based on the applications, and, again, based on the mayor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| But a lot of what we've said, I've heard Commissioner Smith say time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| I'm going to take what the citizens review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| They volunteered their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| We're going to take what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| And that's what we're going to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Now, this seems a lot more random than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| This seems to be cherry picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| And I don't, you know, I've been trying to ask a question about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| There has to be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| If we have these limited funds and we have these processes set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| and these great organizations got zero dollars this year because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| and here we are a couple of months into it, we're saying that, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| we're going to choose five or six others and give funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| and there's no justification other than, you know, the budget's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| So let's go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| The budget's ours to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| There are processes set up that help us pass a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Department heads present their finances for these community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| We've got a community grant panel that deal with these applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and they come up and they rack and stack and they score those, and we fund to a level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| We have extra dollars now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| I think what I'm hearing you saying is that we cherry pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| And I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| I'm trying to understand how that can be okay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| I don't think another way to look at this is to say that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| as we went through and the mayor got various inputs from the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| from the Department of Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| and just from his own experience and the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| that if funds are available, then there's a group of, and this is five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| five agencies that he'd like to do a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| And so, okay, as funds are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| I look at this as a positive as in, okay, we held the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| We were only able to do so much during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| and now we're coming back and asking for an opportunity to do, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| if we had a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| then these are the agencies that were priorities for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| And so I look at this as that we're able to squeeze a little bit more out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| budget, and I look at that as a positive thing and something to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| But, again, there should be a little more input than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1514)|
| 0:25:24| That is my only point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| These are the folks that I want to choose, that I choose to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| If that was a process from day one, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Okay, the mayor is going to pick 20 folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| but we have an organized process that involved the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| They got out of their beds and came down to meetings after meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| and they complied with all the rules and regulations set forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| and they gave a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| And you all are telling me now that, okay, we did that, but we got extra money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| and we're going to spread it how we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| There's just something about that that I just have to take issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| Commissioner, may I comment on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Dean Rice, 925 Mid-South Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| And just to speak to what you're saying, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| this is really a situation where the mayor was able to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| with an organization like East Tennessee Technology Access Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I know you're quite familiar with what they do with very, very limited resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| in providing technology for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Tremendous organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| It's been around for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Under the budget process for this year, the monies were not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| However, that does not mean that the mayor did not fail to see the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| that they bring to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Is $5,000 going to change their ability to function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| Not fundamentally, but it will give Dr. Simonton the tools, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| some of the tools that she needs to do her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| And you're talking about the therapeutic writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| That's a program that, although the funding was not there, the dollars are available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| That's a worthy, worthwhile way to help children, to engage children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| in a way that they otherwise would not be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| So, in terms of the process, the process is that the mayor sees a need here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| was not able to fund it through the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| but was able to now look at the kids over at ETTAC and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| there are dollars, the tools that Dr. Simonton is able to give you change your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| change your ability to learn, change your ability to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| change your ability to engage in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| And that is an incredibly positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| And, as John said, this is a chance to celebrate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Now, in terms of the process, at the end of the day, that's the mayor's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| And the citizen review panel did a tremendous job throughout the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| These are separate dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| And the mayor is excited to be able to look at some of these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| and say, we are able to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| And I'm sure each one of you would be supportive of what Dr. Simonton is doing over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| and what the therapeutic writing is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| John, how much total dollars are we talking about carrying over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| $41,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| For these items right here, these five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| You're carrying over total, you're carrying over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Total you're carrying over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Total is $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| $900,000 related to subdivision foreclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| And so that's one big piece of money that wasn't originally Knox County money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| but we're using their bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| How much are we going to spend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Of the Knox County money, it's about, round numbers, $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Of this $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| It is a positive thing that we have extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| And I'm thrilled to hear that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| but I also want to point out that the reason there wasn't enough money to go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| during the budgeting process was because the mayor made cuts that didn't allow funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| of all these organizations through the proper budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| And this isn't a question of whether these organizations are worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| They all are worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| And the ones that are still not getting funding are worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| My feeling is that as far as these funds go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| that we need to allocate them in accordance with the ranking done by the citizen review panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| That's what we asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| That's what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| That was how we funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| That was how we distributed the funds that were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| And, again, enough funds were not available because the mayor put those cuts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| So if those cuts had not been made, we would have probably been able to fund these groups up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| So I think that I would like to amend the motion that the funds for this particular section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1812)|
| 0:30:25| be allocated according to the same formula used by the citizen review panel for the first allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| I'm just going to talk on the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Are you making a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| No, I'm making an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Yeah, I'd just like to see that list again as to who are the next ones that were in line with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| I don't know who came up with that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| That's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Tell me about Amy or whoever recalls that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Was there a list put out by the citizen's panel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Yes, and it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Correlate to that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Well, they apply first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| There's over 100 nonprofits in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Right, yeah, and some got – are we giving more or less or the same amount they requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| Or can you elaborate on that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Well, the way the process worked this year is citizen review panels met over the three different categories for community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| They did review the applications and did come up with a ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| And we tried to put some funding levels attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| However, that recommendation wasn't to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| The recommendation the citizen review panels made was to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| And we made this clear from the very beginning of the process throughout the citizen review panel process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| that the mayor makes the final recommendations on the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| And that's what those rankings, those amounts that the citizen review panels came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| they did a lot of good work, and I think they gave the mayor a really good framework from which to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| However, that recommendation was to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| The mayor made his proposed budget available to the county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| As far as the process related to these funds, these are going to be defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| They're not going to be community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Defined service contracts didn't have a ranking system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| They went through a process by which the mayor made his proposed budget available to the county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1962)|
| 0:32:53| And just to give an example of how it worked in the past and how it works now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| the process by which these funds are being spent is taking place today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Commission approves the funding, and then commission approves the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| And that's where the public process and the discussion takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| This is a recommendation from the mayor's office for funding for these five agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| If I support Commissioner Burrell's amendment, I don't have those numbers in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| I have them at home, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| I don't know if I'm supporting what came from the citizen review panel or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| I don't want to be dumb about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| That was the gist of my amendment was that these funds would be allocated in the same manner as the ones that we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2014)|
| 0:33:43| when we approved the budget in terms of ranking and percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2023)|
| 0:33:52| And if I may, I would like to add that the citizen review panel makes the recommendations to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| but the mayor makes the recommendation to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| and the county commission is the body that says yea or nay on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| So I appreciate that they make the recommendation to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and that the mayor makes his recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| but it's ultimately the commission that approves this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| And I want to respect the work that our citizens put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I was going to ask Commissioner Burrell if she would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I was a second on the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| And what I would like to do is take away the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| and add to pass without a recommendation so we can look into it before we vote on your amendment for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| Yes, I think that's absolutely reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| Who made the motion to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| I wouldn't be an Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Can you do it without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| So you pull yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Larry, is that okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Let me think here a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Are you good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| All in favor without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| So it would just go without recommendation to Monday and we can compile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Just let us get a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| So the motion is to send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Commissioner Shouse, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I have one question for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Could you explain just a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| It's almost a penny on the tax rate, 903,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Exposures on subdivisions and letters of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Could you just define that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| When a developer does some work on subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| they have to put up either a bond or some sort of letter of credit in order to assure that they're going to do some work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| like whether it's roads or infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| So when that work isn't completed to the county's satisfaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| then the county can access those monies and do the work themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| So we're taking that money, bonds that have been forfeited, called in from an insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| And doing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Doing what the developer said he would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Mr. Smith, a question for Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Grant, could you get us by Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| I'm curious as to what the citizens review panel, because I'm all for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| They've done good work and they have for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Can you show us how close, what they passed and then what the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| I want to see how much the mayor was in sync with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Dollar amounts and percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| If somebody wanted $100,000, he gave them $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| I'd like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| But I want to see how everything lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| We can make that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Grant, same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Just a little different version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| So is there truly a ranking that we can apply to these defined services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| I mean, can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| In terms of the grants process, there were rankings applied to agencies that apply for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2219)|
| 0:37:08| that were put into the grants categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| There was a ranking applied by the citizen review panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Now, keep in mind, those rankings were in different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| So, you know, I don't know if all five of these agencies fit in the same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| So I don't know if you're comparing apples to apples in terms of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| We'll make the information available to you in a way that's hopefully easy to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| and let you all look at how the organizations that are being proposed for a defined service contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| compare to the grant awards from this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| The motion on the floor is to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2264)|

| 0:38:13| Item 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| approving an appropriation in the amount of $134,277.95 from the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| balance for the purpose of reimbursing former Knox County Sheriff Timothy Hutchison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| for reasonable attorney fees incurred while successfully defending an ouster lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| as provided by Tennessee Law Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| I'm going to make a recommendation that we send this on without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| but we do have people who want to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| and we want to give them the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| But my motion would be that we send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| First of all, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| would you brief us on exactly our responsibilities with regards to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| In accordance with Tennessee law, if you have an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| there are several methodologies to attempt to remove an elected official from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| The charter has one in terms of recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| but usually the most common methodology is through the Tennessee Code under the ouster statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| When a lawsuit of that nature is filed, normally the individual affected will hire his or her own counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2359)|
| 0:39:29| and then in the event that they ultimately prevail, in other words, they are not ousted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| and all appeals have run and have been exhausted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| that person may then petition the county commission to pay his or her attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| Under Tennessee law, you may do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| The statute uses the permissive may, not the mandatory shall, meaning you need not do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| However, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| You may pay the entire amount, or if you feel a lesser amount is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| it is within your broad discretion in terms of how you would approach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| We do have some individuals who want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Mr. Moncier has asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Mr. Prince, would you like to speak to it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Does it matter who goes first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Mr. Prince, if you'd like to go ahead and address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Did each of you all receive a package earlier about our position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| And also, would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| I'm Gary Michael Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| We just moved our office at 7610 Gleason Drive, home address 3636 Tallaluna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2435)|
| 0:40:45| This, the lawsuit here basically is about five ouster lawsuits that were filed against Sheriff Tim Hutchison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2445)|
| 0:40:57| And the code says that after final hearing on the complaint that any public officer not removed from office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| or if the officer has been suspended, any officer immediately restored to office may, as Chief Garrett said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| may be reimbursed reasonable attorney's fees by the appropriate state, county, municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| or other political subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| And each of the actions brought by the plaintiffs to Salem, collectively plaintiffs via counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| brought an ouster action either direct or indirectly under Tennessee Code Annotated 847-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| In each of the above actions, our firm, O'Neill Park & Williamson, represented Tim Hutchison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| In each of the actions, we earned a favorable result after final hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| And I gave you a copy of all the complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| And if you look at those complaints, each one I mentioned ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| First, the plaintiffs originally filed a complaint, February 16, 2007, Davidson County Chancery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| in an attempt to move Tim Hutchison from office as a certified law enforcement officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| the deputy sheriff for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| And I give the docket numbers and some other things that I've given you on the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| The action was dismissed in Chancery Court, May 30, 2007, due to improper venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| failure to state a claim, lack of standing, and sovereign immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| On the other, October 16, 2008, the Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| to dismiss the claims, Mr. Hutchison, that he should be removed from office as the deputy sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| On February 12, 2009, the Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| due to the plaintiff's failure to timely file the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Second, cause of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| The plaintiff filed an action in Knox County Chancery Court, February 15, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| In the plaintiff's complaint, an amended complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| the plaintiff directly brought an action under Tennessee Code Annotated 847-101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| to remove Hutchison from office of sheriff or sheriff's deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| We, on behalf of Mr. Hutchison, filed a motion to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and a memorandum of opinion dated July 26, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Knox County Chancery Court dismissed the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| Third, plaintiff saw review June 15, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| a previous decision of the Tennessee Officers Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| or POST in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| The plaintiff's in that incorporated by reference their prior complaint and supplemental complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| Although the supplemental complaint does not directly mention 847-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| the plaintiff indirectly brought an ouster suit under Tennessee Code Annotated 847-101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| by challenging whether or not Mr. Hutchison had to forfeit his office of sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| and sheriff's deputy because he was allegedly not qualified to be the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| and a sheriff's deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| And I have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| You all have a copy of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Davidson County temporarily suspended Mr. Hutchison's benefits pending the Post Commission's August 16, 2000 hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| The trial court decision in this case was not appealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| and Post Commission put him back in good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Fourth, plaintiff filed a notice of a contested case hearing with the Post Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| In doing so, plaintiff attached the plaintiff's petition for deck action, order, the docket number so-and-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| In this action, plaintiff directly challenged whether Mr. Hutchison's position as deputy sheriff was voided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| because he was allegedly not qualified to be a sheriff's deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| August 17, 2007, the Post Commission conducted a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| The Post Commission dismissed the lawsuit against Mr. Hutchison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| and dissolved the temporary suspension of Mr. Hutchison's certification and benefits ordered by Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| Fifth, plaintiff again filed an action in Davidson County, October 4, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| The docket number so-and-so in this action, the complaint referenced the prior actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| Furthermore, the cause of action directly challenged Mr. Hutchison was qualified to serve as a deputy sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| And I made a copy of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| How much time do I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| In each of these cases, plaintiffs attempted to oust Mr. Hutchison from his office as sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| Plaintiffs clearly sought to oust Mr. Hutchison directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| We successively defended those actions and deemed that he was qualified and he should not be ousted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| Now, in this case, I'm going to talk about the pension plan in my letter, which you all had before you saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2731)|
| 0:45:40| You all can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| But these are ouster cases that are unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| The law department cannot pay me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| They cannot hire me and pay me per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Otherwise, you have to, it's a misuse of public funds if I lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| If I was to enter a bill and pay them and lose the case, I'd have to pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| So I stand before you as the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| And in an ouster case, which is unique, the winner gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| In all the cases that Mr. Monsier filed, all those cases he asked for his attorney's fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| and I guarantee if he won, he'd be standing before you wanting his money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| We deserve our money under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| If you'd like to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| We appreciate you all listening to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| and we appreciate being able to represent present public officials from attempts by individuals to oust them from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| Like Mr. Hutchison, public officials face legal attacks that threaten a public official from holding an elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| In these five cases, public officials deserve representation that will zealously fight for them within the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| and the rules of professional responsibility without worrying about the excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| extensive attorney's fees that may incur with these meritless claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| It could happen to any one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Mr. Andrews, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Mr. Prance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Mr. Prance, before you go, if you don't mind, how did you become involved in the first case representing Sheriff Hutchison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2816)|
| 0:47:06| The sheriff in Hutchison wanted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| The law director's office wanted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| I was kind of called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| But they said it's an option thing, as Chief Jarrett has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| You take it at a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| You've got to go before the county commission, and it's up to you all whether or not you want to pay me or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And so I took it basically like a contingency fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| And I didn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| And I understand and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Did they call you on each and every case, or did Sheriff Hutchison just call you after the first case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| I think once I'm attorney of record, I was just accepting service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| I don't recall exactly, but I was the attorney of record, myself and Jeff Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Mr. Prance, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| There's several of these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I was looking back very quickly through this very large record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| It seemed like most of these were back in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Have these all been settled now, or are some of these still pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Some of the cases regarding ouster have been dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| And that was as of October of 2010 was the final ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| We had to go through the appellate process, Court of Appeals, Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| So there was a prodigious amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| And let me say, the bill was over $200,000, and we cut the heck out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| The question I had, so there's several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Some of these were settled before 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| None were settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| All were tried, and I won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| I mean, settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| I mean, it was finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Finished, but, yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| Is that right, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| But they would be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| So they'd be finished, and then they might be appealed in the Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| It was all final in October of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| So that was nearly a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| You know, one of the pieces of documentation that I would like to see since you were hired by the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| is to see the checks that the sheriff wrote to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| The sheriff hasn't written me any checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I said I've received no funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| What I'm here under is to basically I have a lien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| I would not charge any public official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| I took it on a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And the risk was I will be reimbursed or I will be paid by indemnification going before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2971)|
| 0:49:40| Check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Now, I'm not going to stand here as an officer of the court and say a ruse that he handed me a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| and I held it or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| That's what you try to do with a public official, to oust them with a non-meritorious claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| is to bankrupt that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| That's anybody that doesn't like your politics, they can do that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| My other question is, if this was finished roughly ten months ago, why are we just hearing about it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| Well, I wanted to see, quite candidly, what you all were going to do on the Peenston and Smith case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| And I didn't want to come before you if you all didn't have a precedent of paying other people who went after cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| I'm a practical guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| You all paid them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| I don't see why you shouldn't pay me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| That was my rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Which law director contacted you first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Mr. Law Director, Mr. Jarrett, do we have documentation from Mr. Owings that he did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| There would not be documentation from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Was there a letter or anything or any kind of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Robert Watson, I think, had the file and he didn't want to do an ouster case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| And so I got it and then I just met with him informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| And then the sheriff and I met informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| So there's no documentation or letter or any kind of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Yes, I need some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| The resolution as I read it says that we're reimbursing Tim Hutchison for this, not that we're paying it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3065)|
| 0:51:14| So how does this actually work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| Do we cut the check to Mr. Hutchison and he turns around and cuts the check too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| And how do we have any kind of follow-up to make certain that that is what has occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3083)|
| 0:51:34| We can certainly verify that it's done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| I also have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| How much is Mr. Hutchison's UOP pension that he gets right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| Do we know how much that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| The newspaper reported $91,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| That's the newspaper report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| But just for clarification, Mr. Law Director, is that relevant to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| I mean, that has no legal bearing on the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| The statute doesn't take into consideration any other monies the person may be entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| It's purely whether or not the person was sued under ouster, whether it was an attempt to remove that officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| That officer was not removed, and all appeals have been exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| I understand that, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| But I also have to say, you know, this says may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| It doesn't say shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| And the taxpayers are already paying a really sweet pension to Mr. Hutchison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| And I, as a taxpayer, am just a bit offended that he's going to come back and ask for $100,000 more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3163)|
| 0:52:53| whether it was an ouster or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| I think that Mr. Hutchison has made sufficient money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| and is continuing to make sufficient money from taxpayers on his pension that he should be able to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3180)|
| 0:53:09| And I do believe, you all know my record on fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| I believe that everyone should be treated fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| but I think there's probably a big difference between the amount the taxpayers are paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| and have paid Mr. Hutchison and what they paid Mr. Pinkston and Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| And I will not be voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| And this is mainly, I guess, for Monday, because I'm sure we'll deliberate on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| It's kind of what Commissioner Anders and Briggs were getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| I'm trying to understand the mechanics of what happened here and what happened with Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| So, for Monday, I guess this is directed toward the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| If you could have, how was former Commissioner Pinkston's situation dealt with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| Did he pay the funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Did he write, give a retainer to the attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Who did the county disburse the check to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Do we have bills or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| And then the other piece of it was, I don't know if Brad asked a direct question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| so I'd like to maybe clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Could you provide any documentation that former Law Director Owens has with respect to providing attorney fees for the former sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3265)|
| 0:54:37| We'll investigate everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| I know that the practice, from what I can tell looking in old files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| is that generally the law director will send a letter to the attorney and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| if you want to represent this individual, fine, but be advised we cannot retain you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| And any remedy you may be entitled to has to come at the end and conclusion of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| I have seen a form letter like that, but I can't attest to whether or not one was sent in any of these particular cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| But all your questions will be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| You know, I just had one more comment on this, looking at the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| My understanding is that the resolution in the law doesn't say that we will pay the attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| It says we will reimburse an individual, in this case Sheriff Hutchinson, for the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| I'm just reading this right here, for the expenses incurred while successfully defending an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| So he should be the one petitioning us and not an attorney, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| because that's what happened in both Larry Smith's case and happened in Paul Pinkston's case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| They came back to us and said, these were my expenses and I'd like to be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Their lawyers didn't come down here and make petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Any comment, Mr. Prince, or are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| I mean, I'm glad for him to write me a check and then come down here and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| I mean, like I said, with all due respect, and especially Mrs. Broyles, I certainly respect your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| It's just that I've always enjoyed representing people and the fact, you know, we live in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| it's the capital, and the fact that Mr. Shouse may be a millionaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| I'd do the same to him as I would to Mr. Smith or to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| We also want to hear another individual signed up to address us, Mr. Herb Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| Mr. Monsier, I was calculating the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| I want to make sure we're fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| So Mr. Prince had about six minutes, so I want to make sure that you have your equal time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| If you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| My name is Herbert Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| My address is 550 Main Street, Suite 775, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| I have been involved in litigation with regard to citizens attempting to present their grievances to the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3404)|
| 0:56:53| with regard to the activities of Knox County government since 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| when I first represented B. DeSilm and then Wanda Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| We were successful for a number of years until all of a sudden we were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| And then we began to be confronted with Knox County officials at that time, the law directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| and the Knox County government in something known as standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Standing is a concept that has been created by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| And standing has evolved through some of the litigation that we have had here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| And the standing concept says that a private citizen cannot go into court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3454)|
| 0:57:42| to sue to correct a public wrong or an unlawful act being done by government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| unless that private citizen has a special interest or a special injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| Now, let me tell you that I am strongly adamantly opposed to that judicial rule of standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3476)|
| 0:58:04| because what it says is that the doors of this courthouse are not open to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| The doors of this courthouse are not open to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| The doors of this courthouse are only open to those people in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| the law director, the district attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| and those special interest groups who have come to government and not gotten what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| and then they can sue because they're injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| But the general public, if the special interest or the special injury group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| gets what they want from government, and government isn't going to appeal or go to the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| so the people end up being shut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| The doors are shut to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| I'm opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| It is basically, fundamentally, positively wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| And I have said it up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Mr. Prince is before the commission today not because he won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| He's before the commission today because some of the courts that he has cited to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| have said the citizens aren't welcome in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| The citizens cannot complain about the Knox County Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| and 12 Knox County office holders, some of which you hold your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| They can't complain about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| They aren't welcome in our courts because they don't have a constitutional right to reform their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3568)|
| 0:59:36| Mr. Prince won that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| He didn't really win it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| The Knox County Law Director won it, and the State Attorney General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| who proposed that preposterous matter, and the courts accepted it, to our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| Let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Your former law directors, and I am excluding Mr. Jarrett from what I'm saying now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| He's new to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Your former law directors have represented the office holders' interest in the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| in every one of the DeSalem lawsuits opposing the taxpayers and the citizens' interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3609)|
| 1:00:18| The taxpayer has paid its law director to keep the citizens out of court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| to keep the citizens from complaining about what we ultimately won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| and that is the reform of Knox County government, which I am pleased to say this commission now sits in honor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| You are here today because my clients pioneered the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| You are here today because we persevered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| We weathered the criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| I weathered the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Well, somewhat, not completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| But we hung in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| We hung in there until some attorney from Nashville was once again hired by the Knox County taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| to bring the very declaratory judgment action that your law director should have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| but he charged you all $350 an hour to do it, and he didn't understand the way it worked in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| He made a terrible mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| He sued John Smith, who happened to be one of my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| who gave me the opportunity to stay into court through Commissioner John Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| and go to the Tennessee Supreme Court and bring about the Knox County government we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| Had it not been for that, you all wouldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Because had it not been for that, Sheriff Hutchinson would have still been in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| The same thing would have been still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| But because of the guts of these people, they hung in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Now, with respect to what's before you, the statute says, wasn't quoted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| after final hearing on the complaint or petition, there's never been one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| We never got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Because the citizens can't be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| That's how these were dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Not on Mr. Prince's work, but on your law director's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| John Owens and before him Mike Moyers and before him Richard Baylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| all opposed citizens and taxpayers going into the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| to correct the wrongs that were going on in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Not Mr. Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| I don't think Mr. Prince did anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Mr. Prince tagged along with the way things were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| But listen to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Mr. Monser, you have a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| After final hearing on the complaint or petition, any public officer not removed from office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| or if the officer has been suspended, any officer immediately restored to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| may be reimbursed reasonable attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| He was never restored to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| He was never suspended from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| There was a declaratory judgment action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| The Davidson County Courts on May the 30th of 2007 said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| then you, that means where the case should be brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| It's not in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| That's how it was won in Davidson County, but in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| We filed the case in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| It's case number 167022, and it's still pending in Knox County, and I'm going to win it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3795)|
| 1:03:25| It's not over, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| I've kept the litigation alive with regard to Sheriff Hutchinson's pension, with regard to the Uniform Pension Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| Against all odds, I've kept the litigation alive with regard to Sheriff Hutchinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| There is a temporary order down saying that we don't have standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| On June the 21st of 2011, the United States Supreme Court said that the first amendment right to petition your government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3825)|
| 1:03:56| for redresses of wrongs of your government is guaranteed to every citizen of this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| and that includes the right to sue in court, and we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Mr. Monsier, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| The message I leave with you is that the case is still in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| It isn't over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| No questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Mr. Chairman, may I say one other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| I suggest you all get the employment agreement between Mr. Prince and Mr. Hutchinson or Sheriff Hutchinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| An attorney has to have an employment agreement with their client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| I'll bet you there isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| The motion on the floor is to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| No, Commissioner Burroughs says you don't want to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| Okay, so we have one without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| I guess just a general question to kind of reference what Mr. Monsier asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| Is that something that we would have or is that something that we would have to request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| What's that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| The contract or employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Well, the issue is I think there is not going to be an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| If there were an employment agreement, then you would have to pay the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Then you've just committed to the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| The whole idea is there should not be an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| The idea, you know, hopefully there is no agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| or there is a letter saying that you can represent Sheriff Hutchinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| but you do so at your own risk, and if you prevail, you can seek redress to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| Mr. Law Director, I was talking about an employment agreement with Sheriff Hutchinson and Mr. Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| What's their agreement between them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Forget about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Well, Mr. Monsier, I'm not going to engage you without permission of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| but the bottom line is we would not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| If Mr. Hutchinson or Mr. Prince have a contract within each other, that's attorney-client privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| I would not have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Item number 30, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| requesting that the Metropolitan Planning Commission conduct a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| to determine which land use and zoning categories are best suited for the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| and replacement of pain management clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| and make recommendations to the Knox County Commission of such amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| This is Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| If I might address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| The reason that we have brought this forward is that you've heard about the pain clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| We have one in South Knoxville now and John Sevier Highway and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| And the legislature took action in the last legislative session to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| So what we're asking is basically that the MPC look at a study to talk about zoning matters for these types of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| and to come back with us for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Yeah, I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I agree with the premise of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| I just didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Does MPC have the expertise, wherewithal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Do they need to engage the medical community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Are we going to give them that latitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| It seems like he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| The city already has an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| That's how we, the one that would move from West Knox County to Middlebrook to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| We got rid of them off Middlebrook with a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| And so I think the county could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| That's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| That's just another tool in the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| I'll defer to the Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| If the city has done that, will this mirror theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| So notice what we're saying is with this we can now control the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| Yes, I said a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Well, I think you're looking for uniformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| And I was just going to add to the Commissioner's question relative to their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| Already in your code there is some regulation of medical clinics, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| So this would, I think, further expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Where realistically it's a tool you'll have that the statute doesn't provide for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| where you can actually look at it from a zoning perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| And that's been successful in many states as to eliminating nuisances as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| But I think, I don't want to speak for MPC, but I suspicion they're going to look for a uniform plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4103)|

| 1:08:25| On page 7, item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| approving the following documents related to the new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| One, an interlocal cooperation agreement between Knox County, the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| and Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Two, a purchase agreement between Knox County and the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| And three, a memorandum of understanding and agreement between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| and the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Well, there's been some change in the, we've got to change today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| so I don't know what the change was, if Todd wants to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| Yes, let me recognize Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Tim Burchett, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| I was going to ask if maybe Jill Van Beek could come down and go over the presentation with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| If that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| It would be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| First of all, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Commissioner Briggs, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Wait, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Let's go ahead with the presentation, then we'll have any questions that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| And also, I was going to recognize you, Mr. Collins, because you wanted to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Is this the one you wanted to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Then you all are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| My name is Jill Van Beek, 2216 Dawns Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| I work with the Devon Group, and Dave Collins, who's walking that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| but will be back here to speak in a minute, is with McCarty Holesapple McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| who's the architect on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| We appreciate the opportunity to present to you for Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| The school is intended to be a 90,000 square foot facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| The classroom capacity is intended to be 650 students, with expansion potential to 800 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| Dave is going to go into the design components in a little more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| and we can answer some questions from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4217)|
| 1:10:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Without going into too much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| and I don't know how much information you all would like to have related to the design of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| I know most of the issue that you all have or involvement in it has to do mainly with the agreements that are associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4237)|
| 1:10:46| But just to give you an idea of what's being proposed out at the new Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| the project is located on a piece of property that the county brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| or the school system bought about 28 acres several years ago for this elementary school project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| And we've sited the building on about half of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| The building will conform to all of the Knox County design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| I think one of the questions and one of the issues is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| will this school be designed in Knox County standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| And absolutely every aspect of it will be done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| We'll work very closely with Doug Dillingham, with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| Hugh Holt with Knox County and the Industrial Development Board to make sure that this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| every aspect of it conforms to the Knox County school system's design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| As you can see, it's about a 90,000 square foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| It's a one-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| The design is similar to a couple of other schools that the county has in its inventory right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| But one major aspect of the school that is the energy efficiency that we've designed into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| we're going to use a strategy of daylighting of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| so that with the strategic use of daylighting in classrooms and other buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| you'll be able to not run lights and air conditioning quite as much as what you do in other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| So at the end of the day, this will be the most efficient school that Knox County will have in its inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4336)|
| 1:12:25| And we're pretty proud of that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4345)|
| 1:12:36| As I said, this is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| I know this is tough for you guys to see up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| But it's a fairly simple floor plan layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| which really allows for the administration to closely monitor all of the classroom spaces from two points in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4363)|
| 1:12:52| That's an important aspect of school design, making sure they're very secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| The principals in the administration area can view all of the vehicles coming onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| They can see all the buses coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| They can see all of the cars coming onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| The major components of the school that the public would be involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| say the gymnasium, the media center, cafeteria, and administration, are all clustered around one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| So the remainder of the school can be locked off at night, and it's efficient and secure in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| So we've tried to do some really smart things with this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| take the best of what Knox County's built recently in some of its schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| and incorporate some other ideas that, like I said, make it very, very energy efficient and very, very safe to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| That's the basic ideas around the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Again, it's expandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| The core of the building can go up to 800 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| We're currently building it for 650 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| but we can add some classrooms that will get it up to 800 students at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| So if you have any other questions about the design of the facility, Jill or I will be glad to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| This isn't what I had my light on, but I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| How much input did the school board have into this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| Well, the school system insists that the building conform to their design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4457)|
| 1:14:26| And through the process, you know, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| And we've reviewed the initial design with Mr. Dillingham, and he's familiar with the layout of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| And as I said, Commissioner, it mirrors a couple of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| One, Gibbs Elementary, for one, and also the design of the new Southwest Elementary School that's currently under design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4484)|
| 1:14:53| All of those, all three of these, have the basic sort of floor plan arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| There are some minor changes to them, but it's pretty similar in concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| Plus, we reviewed with each of the individual school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| We had them up in our office and walked them through the plan and let them ask questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| And they seemed to embrace the plan quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| We heard no complaints from any of the school board members about the design of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Thank you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| You do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| I've not seen this yet, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| And I know that they're doing, I think, a $2.5 million update on the new gym for the middle school, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| Is this school going to have a gym, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Yes, it will have its own gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| The gymnasium project you're talking about, Commissioner Smith, would be for the Carter Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I didn't know if they were going to share a gym or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I'll see if they have their own separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Yeah, this is on a separate site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Also, I just wanted you to know there will be improvements made to Straw Plains Pike in front of the school to address any traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| You know, we'll be adding some turning lanes and deceleration lanes to address the issues of, you know, the stacking that happens at these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4562)|
| 1:16:11| We've been working with Ms. Pianchi and Mr. Snowden with Knox County Engineering to look at some solutions for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| how to handle widening of Straw Plains Pike in front of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| One last question, Dave, and I know how it is to work with architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| and you're working with the limited budget and people want to get the most of what they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| In your opinion, is there anything on this plan that is not in there that should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| Commissioner Smith, not in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I think, you know, the one thing that Knox County has developed is a really strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| and comprehensive set of design guidelines for architects to design around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| And I think that Mr. Dillingham and his staff have done a really good job of identifying all the components that you want in a new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| modern, effective school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| And so I can't think of anything that is not in this, that's not addressed in the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4622)|
| 1:17:12| So I think it will be an outstanding school when it's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| I believe we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Commissioner, do you have anything about the school itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| I know there are some other issues they want to talk about, but I want to see if you have anything for Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| I don't know if it's for Mr. Collins or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| Was the design different for this one than the southwest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| I mean, did the criteria increase or get more stringent than what was expected for the southwest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4659)|
| 1:17:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| The energy consumption requirements were more stringent for this school than what were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| The main difference then in the criteria is just the size of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| I think southwest is for 1,200 students and this was for a core of 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Let's go start again with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Other issues you have on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| This is not directing it to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| If there's any other commissioners that have questions with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Does any other commissioners have any questions for Mr. Norman or Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| You mentioned design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| Is that parallel with program requirements when we talk about the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| There was some mention of a plus-minus 10% aspect of the contract in terms of program requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4718)|
| 1:18:50| That's somewhat concerning when we say plus or minus 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| With the likelihood sometimes it would be minus 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| I just wanted you to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| When we talk about program requirements, that is programmatic requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| I guess you have to be a practicing architect to really appreciate what I'm getting ready to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| When you have a program requirement that says this room needs to be 100 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| and this one's got to be 200 and this one needs to be 180| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| and you're trying to design something that's efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| sometimes you can't get it to always hit the 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| That sometimes that room will end up being 95 square feet or 98 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| And it's very difficult sometimes to get all the pieces of the puzzle to fit to where it's exactly right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4779)|
| 1:19:48| And so that's why it's beneficial to allow a little bit of flexibility in the size of some of the spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| not to where they would be detrimental to the use of the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| but to allow for the designer to be able to put it together in an efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| And sort of along that same track, what about oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| I'm assuming Mr. Dillingham will be the one primarily responsible for oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| but I was wondering about other forms of oversight, third-party oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| Is the PBA involved in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| I know Mr. Gowian is somewhat of an authority in these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| And so I was wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Have those things been considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Well, that's not my area of expertise in how the project goes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| But, no, the Public Billing Authority is not involved in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| In lieu of the Public Billing Authority, the Industrial Development Board, not from a project management standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| but Hugh Holt with the Knox County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| And as I think contractually he's a member of the Industrial Development Board staff for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| is also providing, in essence, third-party oversight to the work that the developer is doing, in addition to Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4864)|
| 1:21:14| So Hugh would be in representing IDB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| And Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Any other questions for Mr. Collins or Ms. VanBeek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Yes, I'm going to make some comments just about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| so we understand exactly what we're buying and exactly what this is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| I went to the school board meetings the last few times when they've gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| And really what the school is going to cost, and I'm perfectly open if I have some of my figures wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| but these were the numbers that I took at the meeting, is that the school is going to cost $13.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| It will cost an additional $2 million to put the equipment and materials in there before they can open the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| So now we're up to $15.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| There still will be approximately $2.5 million that will be spent for the Carter Middle School gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| And I believe that brings it up to about $18.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| Now, $2.5 million of that will come back from the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| which was the money that was originally going to be allocated for the renovation of the Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| And I don't know how much it costs to tear down the old Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| If you look at this, you know, we've had these other schools around here that lay abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| And this one, of course, is right in the middle of another campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| So that's something that we're going to have to figure into the total cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| I know the headlines said on, I guess it was either Wednesday or Thursday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4975)|
| 1:23:03| that the school board approved the building of a new Carter School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| which implied that they felt that this was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| That was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| And I think that Dr. McIntyre made it very clear in his letter to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| you are not voting on whether you think that building a new school is a wise use of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| What you're voting on is if the county builds the school, will you accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| Because I don't think anyone wanted the county to put, you know, $15.8 million into a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| and then the school board says we don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| So what the school board voted for was if the school is built, then they will accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5018)|
| 1:23:46| When the vote was taken, there were some very good comments made by the school board members from the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5026)|
| 1:23:57| who felt that this was not a wise use of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I think Pam Traynor very, very articulately expressed why, ultimately, the ninth district is going to be shorted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| Because, remember, the money spent on this will not be available for other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| It's coming from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| But this is money that will not be spent on schools elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| My school board representative in the fifth district, Karen Carson, voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| After it had passed, she changed her vote to yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| But she felt that this was not a good use of public dollars for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| because renovation was what the school board felt was the proper use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| Also, Indika Cannon said that she would vote to accept it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| but she made it very clear that she felt that this was not in the best interest of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| when they have to consider what the needs are across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| And even Cindy Buttrey, who was a very, very strong proponent of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| and I hate to put words in other people's mouths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| but she said that she was really going to support this, you know, as did Thomas Deakins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| because this was not going to cost the school board money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| If this was, quote, free money that was given as a gift to the county, she was not going to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| And I think as we look at what the budget process has been over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| I think we've made some good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| I know there's been a lot of discussion and people will disagree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| but I think we've exercised very good caution in these economic times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| when we've seen when other communities have gotten into problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| As you may have seen, I think it was a week and a half or two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| there was a community up in Rhode Island that declared bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| Birmingham, Alabama, the county where Birmingham, Alabama is, I believe it's Jefferson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| their county commission is debating whether they should declare bankruptcy because they have things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| We've exercised very good caution in this last budget, and I'm extremely proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| But when I see what we're doing here where the school board has voted not once, not twice, not three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5160)|
| 1:26:11| that renovation is the proper use of citizens' funds for the problems that they have at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| and everyone agrees that there's problems, that we should not be approving this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| simply because a promise was made a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| And I hate to get back to quote one of the Republicans that I admire more than anyone is Ronald Reagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5191)|
| 1:26:40| In the debate with Walter Mondale, he looked over at him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Here we go again, here they go again, and here we go again voting for something that's very expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| that's been looked at by the elected school body that said it's not needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| but we're going to go ahead and do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| And it's going to be at the expense of other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| And, you know, I think, again, I said over there in the ninth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Pam Traynor was very, very clear about why this was not good for her district, as was Lynn Fugate in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5224)|
| 1:27:12| as was Miss Detheridge, and as was Karen Carson in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| And for that reason, I don't think that we should approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| believing that the school board thought that this was good use of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| The school board only said that they would accept the school if it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| The majority on that board still felt that this was not a good use of dollars and it was not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| Well, I don't have much to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Dr. Briggs, I think you made all my arguments and made them beautifully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5267)|
| 1:27:54| There are a couple of things that I will add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| I think that I don't believe that the county should go forward with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| I agree with the school board that it's not the best use of taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| and that renovation is the wisest course of action here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| However, well, I'm just going to say that there are a lot of issues that will need to be addressed if we do move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5300)|
| 1:28:37| And aside from the fact that the school board does not think this is a wise use of our taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5317)|
| 1:28:50| there's also some serious policy implications involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| the implications of selling off Knox County assets for funding a project like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| And although we've been assured that this is a one-time deal and this will not set a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| what do we tell the other communities who want new school construction rather than renovations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| What do we tell the parents at Adrian Burnett and Richard Yokely and the schools in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| who are going to have to wait longer now because we are spending so much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| when renovations would have been much less expensive and would have sufficed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5370)|
| 1:29:38| How are we going to tell those parents and those communities no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| If you were a parent of a child in one of those schools, would you take no for an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| If you see the county commission agreeing to build a brand-new school for one community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| and say this is the only time that they're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| if you were a parent of a child in a school that's run down and that's going to be delayed on renovations because of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5402)|
| 1:30:12| would you take no for an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| I can tell you that I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| And I don't think that the parents in the other parts of Knox County will take no for an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| And I don't think they are going to appreciate hearing no for an answer when they come to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| well, even though the school board says renovations will work, we don't agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| We want a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| How are we going to tell them no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Question, I guess, for either Todd or Hugh in terms of how the proposal of this thing is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5445)|
| 1:31:01| Is there not going to be a project manager for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| You hold Purchasing Director 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| There will be a project manager on behalf of the Devon Group, and I will act as project manager for the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| and Doug will act as project manager for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| So you have experience at that, or this is kind of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| Yeah, I've been involved with construction for about 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| Well, I'm saying it sounds like you're all three, so you're going to have three project managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| Someone has to be in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| So who, when it comes time to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| The lead will come from Devon Group, but as we go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Doug and I will be basically signing off on each phase of the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| to make sure it's consistent with school design standards and program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| So has the IDB ever served as a project manager in any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| I will have to defer to Todd on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5520)|
| 1:32:10| The answer is no, and that's why the IDB will be using the Knox County Purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| under the Memorandum of Understanding to perform that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| I guess maybe someone in the mayor's office, John or someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| so why did the mayor make the decision to go this route, propose this route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5549)|
| 1:32:38| Maybe the superintendent may want to address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| This seems to be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| I mean, everything here is new, but even the management of it is kind of a first out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| It started, I think it was in last December, that the mayor approached the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| and asked for their participation to go through a new bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| and the school board agreed, and the school board agreed to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| and the school board sent representatives to help come up with the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| that would be ultimately used on the request for proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and then the school board also included personnel in the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| And, yeah, we did ask the Industrial Development Board of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| to be the conduit or the facilitator for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| but in the end the whole purpose was coming up with a unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5614)|
| 1:33:41| or the best functionality of a school for the school board to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5621)|
| 1:33:49| and so we wanted to build a school that the school board could use well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and use to advance the cause of education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| Yeah, but, I mean, those are all great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| That's what we're all trying to do, but to get there, this seems to be a pretty convoluted route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| So is this a contractor at risk contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| Is this a bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| This is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| It's a design bill with a guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| And that maximum price is $13.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| John, you know, this thing has evolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| and kind of comment on what Commissioner Briggs was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| I mean, this has been before us in several different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| At one point, I think I know, during the bid process, this was bid as a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| kind of out of the box thinking you're going to take the UT Battelle model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| that you're going to have the contractor, Divine Group or McCarthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| hold the note and we'll pay them over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| That's how it was bid, correct, similar to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| This wasn't part of the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| No, but it was a part of the bid evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| So the bid was, so that, could you talk about why we didn't stick with that model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Number one is just to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| And then number two, we had a very clear message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| that the mayor is very determined to keep Knox County's total debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| to a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| And so we include those two basic things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| In the end, it would take the contractor what we saw in the prices when we came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| and the proposals that we came back is that they would get the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| and then they would charge us for those funds an amount that would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| than what we would be able to do that for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| And also, the mayor has been very clear in his desire to not increase the county's indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| Okay, well, that was supposed to be the whole reason for this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| that we wouldn't hold the note, that, you know, the successful bidder would hold the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| Mr. Law Director, was there any legal issues associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| I know that there had to be a state law passed and all that other good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| Was that never done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| We researched that fully, and the Tennessee Code provides for this very methodology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| using the IDB as the conduit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| No, I'm talking about the previous where the contractor held the note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| and we paid the contractor back over a period of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| I haven't been involved in such a transaction since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| and we can certainly look in the archives and see if it's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| As I look at this thing, it's been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| We sat here for a while and we talked about this being a $5 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| That's what it came up, you know, to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| They're doing them in Union and Granger County for $5 million, no more than $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| Then it became an $8 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| You know, there's for 600, 700 students, $8 million project will get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| We already own the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| We got the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| $8 million to build a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Now we're sitting here looking at 13.8 for a quasi-operational entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5846)|
| 1:37:36| 13.8 will not serve the citizens of the Carter community in any substantial way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| They need an additional two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| So we got a $15.8 million project that when we voted not to move forward with the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| part of the reason that I heard was, hey, if we can throw another $2 or $3 million with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| we can get us a whole new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| And that's kind of how these conversations have evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| Then it became, okay, well, we're not going to have to increase the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| We're going to put that on the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| You know, the market is prime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| This is, you know, kind of the perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| We have hungry contractors out there really wanting work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| and this is the perfect model to have them own this building, and we pay for it in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5904)|
| 1:38:32| And we'll get great rates, and things are going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| That fell apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| So now here we are, you know, basically telling the school board and superintendent, we'll build it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| And a lot of those folks voted for this on that sheer reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| They just kicked the can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| It's no skin off of our, you know, back, which I do think is a little short-sighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| but because we are a community and all things hang together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| But, you know, for whatever reason, they chose to vote on it, and several of them on that factor alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5941)|
| 1:39:09| not on the fact that renovation is not the proper thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| And I agonized over the first vote, whether to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| When I was listening to that $5 million price tag, it kind of made sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| You know, well, maybe we can, you know, add something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| But this isn't close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| This is not close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| We're talking about $16 million on what we voted for, a $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| Again, for us to delay it was a couple of extra million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| and now we're talking about an additional, you know, $14 million, conservatively speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5982)|
| 1:39:50| These are real dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| However you look at it, they're coming out of our coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| And this has become really complicated and convoluted, and let's deal with this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=5996)|
| 1:40:05| Let's not say let's pass it and we'll let the mayor figure out how he's going to fund it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| or we're going to take it out of debt or we're going to take it out of general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| That's going to only continue this convoluted evolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6014)|
| 1:40:22| So then we're going to start getting things, very uncomfortable things, presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| things that I don't think will pass this commission, you know, some national resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6026)|
| 1:40:33| some local resources, some local treasures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| You know, to me, some of the things put on the table is equivalent of President Obama saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| well, we're in pretty dire financial straits here, but we've got a great national park down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| that will go for great condos and high-rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Let's sell the Smoky Mountain National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| It's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| So we're going to deal with some really unfortunate issues that's going to come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| if we kick this thing on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| We know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| And if we do all this, are we going to get $13 million out of these sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| This economy, you ask appraisers what properties are going for, pennies, pennies on the dollar right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6079)|
| 1:41:26| So we're going to have to sell more of it, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| So, you know, this conversation is just unfortunate that we're having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| You know, and then we talk about it was promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| I want to deal with that for a minute, and then I'll pass the mic to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| A lot of us ran on the fact that that day of making these promises, the good old boy, I scratch your back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6109)|
| 1:41:59| you scratch mine days, are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| We ran on the fact that this is no way to run accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| The same folks that made this promise were doing backroom deals, were doing unsunshined meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| were dealing with things in ways that weren't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| And all that's come to light now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| So this is a new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| This is a commission that are doing things above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| So for us to say, well, this deal that was made for another deal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| it somehow holds standing and merit, I just don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| I think we need to deal with our budget the way it is today, not the way it was in the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| or whenever this deal was initially cut or we purchased this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| And just move forward and say, does it make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| The superintendent, the Dillingham have all sat before us and said, renovation will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| Renovation is our method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Renovation for this type of structure is the best way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| And what they also said is, and what I read in the paper is, but I'd be a fool not to take $11 million unburdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6195)|
| 1:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Then, again, we can deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| But let's deal with this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| Let's say we understand your plight, but we have to do what's responsible to all Knott's Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6210)|
| 1:43:41| And given this present situation, this school is best suited for renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Yeah, I guess the question is to Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Hugh, if we vote this in next Monday, this MOU, does it start to process construction and we're moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6233)|
| 1:44:02| Moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Two questions for you because we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Where's the funding mechanism for the overage of the ñ because we're looking at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| if his numbers are correct to fill the school up, to furnish it, to computerize it, where are we going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| Where's the $15.8 million going to come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| And where's the overage that's going to come from because no government building is built on budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| We have a guaranteed maximum price, and so that price is fixed, and that was part of the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| One of the things that we look forward to working closely with Doug Dillingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| and the school's facilities people is bidding out the furniture and fixtures that will be a part of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6283)|
| 1:44:52| And we did not want to include numbers until we went through that bid process so we would have hard numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| Okay, John, stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| I'll ask you a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| The school is going to cost, what's the maximum price, $13.8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| $13.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| We have $13.8 million in the bank right now ready to pay for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| No, but we've got two years to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| And let me just say that is that there's no payments due on this school until the school board would accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| So that's approximately two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| So we've got two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| There wouldn't be any property sold that wouldn't go first to the county commission to give us direction to sell on how to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6326)|
| 1:45:36| how to best sell that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| And then, two, there wouldn't be any property sold until it came back to the county commission and approved the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| So you'd have a property methodology and sales price that you'd have to approve in each instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| And so if there were any properties that the county commission didn't agree with, then that wouldn't be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| That's totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| You're not answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| My question is, if we don't have the $13.8 million to pay the bill in two years, where does the money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| Because right now we don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| As a fallback position, okay, just an FYI that we've got a number of items that are in the works right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6370)|
| 1:46:19| But as fallback positions, we've got two pieces that are in the memorandum, the agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6379)|
| 1:46:28| And in the agreements, it provides for backstops of the general fund reserves and the debt service reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| And so the county will have those as items to fallback to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6396)|
| 1:46:47| As far as the furniture and fixtures, you know, going through the bid process with the school, the appropriate school's people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6407)|
| 1:46:56| then we'd be able to put hard numbers and include that in the capital plan in next year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| So that's not included in the 13 point capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| And that's normal standard practice for how the schools build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| John, I guess this is for you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| I just wanted to, well, first of all, when I visited, being an old teacher and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| and seeing the school and the condition of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| I was always questioning whether the wise use of funds would be to renovate or to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6451)|
| 1:47:40| And, of course, an old school like that, with all the problems that it had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| I really did question somewhat the choice of renovation over a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6466)|
| 1:47:53| But as we start to look at some of these very well-stated questions about expenses and process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6473)|
| 1:48:04| there's a couple other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| My questioning line goes back, I guess, into the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| And I need you to sort of put some flesh on some process for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| One is in that lease buyback arrangement that started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| can you just kind of explain how we went from there, the selection, the bid evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6506)|
| 1:48:36| and then to design, build, and how the Devon Group was selected, why they were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6516)|
| 1:48:45| Would you fill that in for me a bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| I guess earlier I said that the mayor asked the school board to participate in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| and to go out and seek proposals on a Carter plan and how they would best address the Carter plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6536)|
| 1:49:05| There was a group of people that were included to include the design specifications and the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6545)|
| 1:49:12| The school board was very clear, and the school administration also were very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| that they wanted to make sure that any facility would meet all of the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| and program standards of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| And that was there from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Doug Dillingham has been very integral into the building of the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6566)|
| 1:49:34| to include those standards into the request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| and was very insistent and very accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| We wanted to make sure that his requirements were included in that request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6581)|
| 1:49:49| And so the evaluation committee received those proposals and included in those proposals were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6589)|
| 1:49:59| and I probably need the help here of Hugh Holt to talk about who was on the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| There were three financing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| The evaluation committee was made up of representatives from the school administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| as well as a representative from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| There were representatives from the private industry, architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6618)|
| 1:50:25| and of course the committee led by Mitch Steenrod, the CFO of the pilot corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6625)|
| 1:50:34| And in that process, through the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| it was our intent from the very beginning to have a turnkey operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| a design-build contract that had a GMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| So we wouldn't have to deal with the unexpected like rock and other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| that you would typically have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| and have allowances in your construction budget to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| So from the very beginning, it was our intent to have a design-build project with a GMP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| and transfer all the risk for construction back to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| as well as carrying the finance charges through that construction project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| which is a tidy sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| And the end result, of course, we had three options for financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| and those options have been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| But at the end, we also reserved the option to pay for the school on its day of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6688)|
| 1:51:41| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| There are some critical issues that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| One is that I don't think there's a single one of us up here that would sign a contract on a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6712)|
| 1:52:00| that hasn't been built yet not knowing where the money is going to come from to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| If we weren't guaranteed a mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| or if we hadn't already sold whatever we were going to sell, we wouldn't sign a contract on a new build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6733)|
| 1:52:22| None of us would do that personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| and I don't see why we should do it with public dollars or with the public's trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| The fact is we don't have the money to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| We don't know that we're going to get the money to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| We don't know what the administration is thinking about selling off to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| We may not agree with the things that the administration wants to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| I personally have a hard time justifying selling off an asset that belongs to all the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| that benefits all the taxpayers, that's going to benefit one community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| I don't think that people of Knox County would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| I think one of the issues we need to address is this selection process of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| The model for the development of this new school, it has changed drastically since that initial RFP was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6804)|
| 1:53:32| The way the administration wanted to do it, there needed to be a change in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| and the bill that was put out for it didn't even make it out of committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| So they had to scramble back and find another way to try to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| So the RFP or this model, it's changed drastically since that initial RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| The developer, as Commissioner McKenzie pointed out, originally the developer was carrying the risk, but not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6835)|
| 1:54:04| The developer's risk has been greatly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| It's now being almost entirely borne by the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| And now this model, it's simply a two-year construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| And I know that there are many local construction firms that are asking why Knox County is not bidding out this school construction project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6858)|
| 1:54:27| to ensure the best cost for the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| And since the funding of this project does call for the selling off of taxpayers' assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| I believe it's in their best interest to find the best deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| This is now a defined construction project using Knox County funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| and not a development project where the developer carries the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| And a construction bid can be completed and a true construction cost can be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| It might be different than what they're telling us if we actually bid this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6894)|
| 1:55:02| There's also issues surrounding the chosen developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| More than four years ago, this same group was selected to develop the county-owned property at State Street and Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6907)|
| 1:55:14| And it was a proposal that involved a 21-story sentinel tower totaling 310,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| with retail shops and office space and residential condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| And we conveyed that prime downtown property to the Devin Group for $800,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6925)|
| 1:55:32| with this commitment that they were going to increase its property value and create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| That's not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| And I think that before we approve another proposal, that we need an explanation why nothing has happened with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6939)|
| 1:55:48| I don't know that we need to approve another one when there's still been no action on that first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6948)|
| 1:55:58| There's also an issue involving the construction contractor that's been chosen for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| There are unresolved problems with the previous construction project involving Knox County funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6964)|
| 1:56:11| I think that we should get a review of the construction issues with the Knoxville Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| and we need a report on the ongoing litigation related to that before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6978)|
| 1:56:30| This is all, I think, very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=6990)|
| 1:56:41| And I think that these are all issues that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7001)|
| 1:56:50| This issue has changed, or this process, this project has changed drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| Originally, it was very creative, out-of-the-box thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| but now it's become just a two-year construction process of a new school that's going to cost us $18 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7021)|
| 1:57:10| that we don't have and that we don't know where it's going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| And this isn't about, you know, every child in Knox County deserves the best that we can provide for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7035)|
| 1:57:23| So this isn't a question of who deserves what or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| but sinking this much money that we don't have yet and we don't know for sure that we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7050)|
| 1:57:38| You know, we just sold Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| And we were all high-fiving because we sold it for more than the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| But let me tell you, guys, it was not a great deal for the Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| We lost a couple of million dollars in that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| If you take what we paid for that Solway property and the improvements that we made to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| the taxpayers lost money on that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| I think that three million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| We all know what kind of shape the market's in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| I don't want to be forced into selling off assets below what they're worth to pay for one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7096)|
| 1:58:28| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| I guess, I don't know, you hold, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| What is the bond on this from the Devon Group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| It will be 100 percent performance and 100 percent payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| So the 13.8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| It's inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| So, basically, they are carrying the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| If they don't build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| They carry all the risks from the beginning to the end until we write the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| So if they don't finish it and. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| It becomes Carter Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| It's their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| I've been on board for doing this since when I first started running and campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| It was asked to me in several forums what I think about Carter getting a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7157)|
| 1:59:24| The first answer I gave was I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| I don't know enough about the situation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| So while I was running, I decided to go out there and take a look and walk around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| and visit the classrooms and talk to the teachers and talk to the parents to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| Because, yes, I live in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| I don't go east unless I'm going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| And it's not because I think I'm better than them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| It's just I only work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| There ain't no sense in going out there if I don't work, you know, have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| The thing is is that once I dug into it and I could smell the classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| see the cafeteria where they're having to eat in four different shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| When you flush the urinals out there, it backs up into the water fountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7209)|
| 2:00:17| I mean, they have issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| This school is very, very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| Now, is there other schools just as old or older?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| But I've been to Bearden Elementary in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| It's not anywhere near the shape that Carter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| I've been out to Blue Grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| It's not in the shape as Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| When I was asked it again, I told them that I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| If we can find the money, I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| And given us two years to come up with the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| then I think we owe that community that chance to try to find that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| And there is a safe clause in this that most people may not like, but it will take the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| If we don't create or generate the funds between now and that two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| we do have that safe fall of the emergency fund or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7269)|
| 2:01:16| So, I mean, we do have the money in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| HVA, the school board didn't question when the county agreed to pay $54 million for a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| They took that and ran with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| It didn't cost them anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| It isn't on their capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| It's on ours, the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| And this commission didn't blink either when they approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| I wasn't on the commission then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| Eight years ago, the school board commission voted to build a new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| and purchased the land to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| That is a promise that we've owed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| And I said when I first voted on this last September when it came up that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| if we're not going to build a Carter Elementary, we need to sell that land out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| because that's giving false hope to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| Now, does Adrian Burnett deserve a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| They're sitting in a wooden building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| And I would fight just as hard for them because I do have children in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| And I do want the best education at my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| And that means providing them the best tools that we can possibly provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| If it means iPods instead of books, I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| If it means investing in our schools, which we're going to have to start investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| We've got schools that are falling apart out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| And if we do not start doing other stuff than renovating, we're going to be in a world of hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| because these schools are not going to be able to stand the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| Carter Elementary has grown 14% last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| They're almost at full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| If we renovate, then we would meet the capacity of that within three years, three to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7374)|
| 2:03:03| So what do we do then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| We turn around after we spend $2.5 million renovating and say, oh, we need a new Carter Elementary now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| Now, that's wasting county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| I would rather not waste the $3 million now, and I'd rather do a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| Same way with Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| I was not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| I felt it was a bad business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| I was not very popular with the people in my district, especially the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| But it did not make sense to me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| The Solway property, yes, we lost $2 million if you look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7414)|
| 2:03:43| But we also put that property back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| Now, we will generate and make that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| It will take us a while, but we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| But if we don't put it back on the tax rolls, we wouldn't have made anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| We'd just sit out there with nothing on it and bring in no revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| And my final thought, as far as I've been to the school board meetings, I've sat down several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| Not as many as Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| I guess I have a personal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| No slam on you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| But I was at the meeting, actually, when my school board commissioner, Lynn Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7459)|
| 2:04:31| said that she had not heard from a single person in her district that wanted this built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| I've heard 75 percent of the people in my district, and I visit a lot of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| and go to a lot of homeowner association meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| I talk to my people out in my districts, and they have 75 percent of them said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| we need to build this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| We promised it eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| We need to fulfill that promise and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| The Carter community deserves this, and I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| Question on probably someone from the school board, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7507)|
| 2:05:14| What's the plan for tearing down or remodeling, surplusing, mothballing the present building since this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7514)|
| 2:05:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| I'm the superintendent of schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| Commissioner, the $5 million that the interlocal agreement that was before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7540)|
| 2:05:47| says that the commission will appropriate contemporaneously with approval of that agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| would fully fund the capital plan from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| and that contemplated a new middle school gymnasium and site work at the Carter campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7558)|
| 2:06:05| as well as a renovation of a Carter elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| Half of that would be set aside to fund the proposal that the mayor has made for a new Carter elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| and half of that would remain for work at the Carter site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| Our thinking is, and again, based on just some very preliminary estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| is that because we'd have to do a lot less site work in terms of parking and the roadways at the Carter campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| that that would allow for an appropriate level of resources to be able to do demolition of the existing Carter elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| if the board so desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| So you think you're projecting that the two and a half, which they said school was giving back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7601)|
| 2:06:48| which they're really not because we haven't given it to them, is going to be the remaining two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| It's going to build your Carter middle school gym, do the site work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| and tear down the Carter elementary school, the present building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| Question on capacity and the projections for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7625)|
| 2:07:12| That was brought up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| What are the projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| I know you all look at this years out, not months out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| So what does the Carter community look like three, five years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| Well, Carter's enrollment actually has been very steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| And I actually took the opportunity to look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| We've been talking about this for a little while, so I took the opportunity to look back at the enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| It's actually been in the neighborhood of 500 to 525 students for the last 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| I mean, since I think I looked back at 1984, it was right about 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| And that's where it is in that neighborhood today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| Projecting beyond four or five years is difficult because then you're projecting for kids who haven't been born yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| But we see perhaps slow growth over time, but we don't anticipate any kind of major growth at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7678)|
| 2:08:07| But I think the proposal before the commission does provide for potential contingencies if we do see substantial growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7687)|
| 2:08:15| There's the opportunity to, because we would potentially build the core of the school building, the cafeteria, the gymnasium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7695)|
| 2:08:23| and the like for a larger number of students, that there's adequate capacity there for even if we do see some growth in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| But unlike the Southwest schools, you don't see anything on the horizon that says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| I guess I don't know if the number 14 percent is accurate, but you don't see that going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| continuing on to where they're going to, you know, three years from now, they're at 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| The number is known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| Based on the dynamics that we know right now, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| Again, projecting enrollment is more as much art as it is science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| But based on our projections right now, we see some slow growth over time, but not necessarily explosive growth in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7736)|
| 2:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| And question for, I don't know, John or someone, you talked about taking these funds out of the debt service reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7745)|
| 2:09:16| Is that doable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| I think before we presented anything, we would certainly make sure that the law director is comfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7762)|
| 2:09:33| and before we took any proposal back to the county commission that that would have that review through the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7773)|
| 2:09:43| Well, you had brought it up like that's a potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| I think it was Commissioner Anders' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| That was a potential revenue source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| But that's not our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| Our first intent is really to raise money outside of that, and those are just backstops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7793)|
| 2:10:02| Before we get there, just one of the things just to let people know that we've had some discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7802)|
| 2:10:09| We wanted to match up one-time monies with a one-time project, and that way we can not have an ongoing responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7809)|
| 2:10:21| But this is just to enable to fund a one-time expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| We've got some one-time revenues identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| Solway is $2 million to start out with, and we've got a number of other one-time funding streams that will help us get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7828)|
| 2:10:39| Are there any other funding streams besides selling off the resources of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7839)|
| 2:10:46| Sure, like right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| The county is the holder of the 9-1-1 mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| There's $3.4 million, and we don't necessarily need to be in the banking industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| The 9-1-1 board has agreed to put that out for bid, and their intent is to repay Knox County $3.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| It's a one-time revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Now, that will go a long way toward getting us to this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| Okay, so help me understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| We hold the mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| They make monthly payments, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Annual payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| They make annual payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| So we would lose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I mean, that's kind of a wash in long term, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| Are we charging an interest rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| So that's actually generating us funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| We're just, in essence, breaking even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| But I think what's important to know is that we feel comfortable that in the two years, there's no money due until the school is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7901)|
| 2:11:51| There would be no property sold that the county commission didn't agree with, one, on the method of sale, and then two, on the price of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7911)|
| 2:12:00| And so, like Soloway, the county commission agreed that auction was the best way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| and the county commission agreed to accept $2 million for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| Okay, there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Right, but again, you know, I think it was Dwight stood up here a year and a half ago and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| we want to get out the mulch business, and you had heads nodding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| I don't know if you have heads nodding, do we want to get out the golf business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| do we want to get out the Board of Education building business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| I think those decisions, so we made the decision a year and a half ago with a resounding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7948)|
| 2:12:37| there was some opposition, but a general yes, we want to get out the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| We don't have that at this point, and that was a year and a half later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| We can't necessarily take credit for something that we all wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| and there's this thing out there that we may sell some things that some of us hold near and dear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7970)|
| 2:12:59| But the county commission would still have that authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| and so it would be up to the county commission on each piece of property what is a method of sale, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| and then what is an acceptable price, and the county commission would be able to vote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| Yeah, that sounds good today, but what it's going to be a year and a half from now, a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| is you're holding us hostage, just to be blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| Either we sell this property or we take it out of general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| because we don't know whether we can take it out of debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| There may be some legalities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Okay, so say we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| Say the law department says we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| So now we're faced with a building half built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| So, again, if we had everything listed today, we could make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| You're asking us to commit ourselves to $15.8 million, which may be higher for you on the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8029)|
| 2:13:58| It may be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| That's just a placeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| And equipment is not getting any cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| So $15.8 million, we would agree to today, and then we're held hostage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8044)|
| 2:14:13| Either you take it out of debt service, I mean fund balance, you raise property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| or you sell off this jewel, or you sell off this slug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| I don't know, whichever one it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| It depends on what you're bringing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| But you're asking us to commit to that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| If you gave us a list, we expect these 13 items to bring in this $15.8 million, then I could see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8071)|
| 2:14:40| But what you're asking us to do is own a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| Well, we've got two years to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| So what you're saying is that if we gave you a list next Monday, you'd be prepared to vote for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| No, I'd be prepared to deliberate over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| I have nothing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| I mean, I have a newspaper article that said a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| We don't know the value of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| In Solway, we had time to figure out the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| We had time to figure out the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| This is two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| It has to add up to $15.8 minus $2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| That's what you're asking us to do right here, right now, or next Monday about this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| So, again, this is tough, and we may be able to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| We may not be able to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| I feel very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Just to respond to your comments, I feel very comfortable we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| I feel very comfortable we can get there in a manner that this commission, the majority, will vote for these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8144)|
| 2:15:53| Please provide me then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| I think this is a great way to help advance the cause of Carter and advance the cause of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8154)|
| 2:16:01| And maybe we don't own some properties that we shouldn't own anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| Maybe this will reduce the scope of county services and simplify so that we can better live within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| I think this all works together and helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| You know, again, that's political ideology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| It's the same thing if someone doesn't like national parks saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| why should the national government be involved in national parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| We need to get back to the core things that our founders set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| Let's get out of the national park business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| Why are we building weapons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| We need to get out of that business and stop funding these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| You're giving your opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| The mayor's opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| But what you're asking us to do is whether we have that share, that opinion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| to step out and go $15.8 million based on an opinion that we need to get out of these businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8214)|
| 2:17:03| that we need to stop funding parks, stop funding senior centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| stop funding all of these things that have made Knox County what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| Maybe that's your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| Maybe that's the mayor's opinion, but what you're giving us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| So you said that you could comfortably come up with 15.8 minus 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| That's 13.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| You said you could comfortably do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| I would love to have that in my hand Wednesday or Thursday so that we could deliberate over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| And what I also think that needs to be vetted through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| If you say this building's worth, A.J. building's worth $8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| I would love to have a corporate appraisal done on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| But we don't have time for that because you're asking us to vote on this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| But since you said you were comfortable in delivering that product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| I would love if you could provide that to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| Well, I think in a way to frame this, I'm glad because I want to help facilitate your deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| But I think I can present you some information that will help you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| But I think I also frame it in a way as how can we build a school for these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| And, okay, that makes these choices a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| We've been building schools a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| We have 88 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| 87 of them I think we built from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| I think the only school we haven't built from the ground up is this new STEM academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8318)|
| 2:18:44| We know how to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| That's not what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| We're talking about a first time out of the box with IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| first time out of the box with school board not necessarily controlling the building of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| first time out of the box with the Devon Group being a tri-head council of building a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8338)|
| 2:19:08| not knowing necessarily who's in charge between Doug and Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| but they'll do whatever as long as it takes 15.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| We know how to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| We know how to renovate schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| We do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| In a county this size, this old, we know how to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| So I take a little bit of offense at people saying or you saying that, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8370)|
| 2:19:39| you saying that this is the way to build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| Where is that proven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Where is that proven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| I take a little bit of offense at people saying that this is a fixed cost, this is a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| For whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| I just wish we could have all the data in front of us so that we can make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8397)|
| 2:20:06| We don't have that, and that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| Mr. Troy, I need you up front, but back on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| Anything else you want to say, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| This has opened up a lot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| Mr. Chairman, don't we have a couple, two people that serve on IDB board from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| Or is there more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Is there three people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| John, on IDB board, don't we have $11.1 million from Midway and that we could possibly use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8435)|
| 2:20:46| I'm just trying to, you know, we're trying to come up with money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| Is that not somewhere we can tap some of that money, that $11.1 million that wasn't used for Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| That would be on deposit with the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| But, yeah, there's county money that has been provided to the development corporation for the purpose of developing Midway, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8458)|
| 2:21:08| In your tenure here, have you ever seen where we've been able to tap that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| No, but we haven't asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| That's $11.1 of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| You've heard a lot of discussion here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| And I keep coming back to a one-time this, a one-time this, a one-time that, a one-time that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| This is not a one-time this or that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| I can name you about five or six schools right now around the county that are almost in bad shape as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8502)|
| 2:21:52| It's not, well, I'm going to have to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8512)|
| 2:22:00| I've been out to Carter, and I would agree, they need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| But they're not the only ones that need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| So to say this is a one-time thing is totally erroneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| We've got a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| Somebody brought this up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| We've got to do some serious school building if we're going to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| So we need to sit down and make out a plan that's going to be taken into consideration, all of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8541)|
| 2:22:28| and what is it going to take to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| And that's where we're going to have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| I'm not comfortable, along with some others I've heard speak so far, in betting on the come on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| and said, okay, let's build it and worry about getting the money later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| I don't like that idea at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| Again, I come back to say, though, that, you know, there were promises of school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| I can name you two or three others that were promised also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| But I know they need it, but I'm just not sure this is the way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| We do have a plan on how to get there, the school's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| They've evaluated the school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| They've decided what needs to be done to bring all of our schools as quickly as possible up to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8594)|
| 2:23:25| that we expect and require for our children's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| So there is a plan there, and it's the capital plan, the school's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| And if we do this, we are setting that plan back, and we are telling the other schools who are also needy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| your children are not as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| I also think that, you know, if you come down and look at any school in the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| including the school that my daughters go to, I think Beaumont has been renovated five times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8628)|
| 2:23:55| if I'm not mistaken, and it's older than Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| We renovate schools in existing communities, and we build new schools where there's new growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| The growth projections in Carter have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| It's not grown like it was projected to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| It's not expected to grow explosively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8655)|
| 2:24:22| You know, of course, our intent, of course the intent is to be able to pay this in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| Nobody intends to get a car wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8668)|
| 2:24:31| Nobody intends to, you know, break a bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| Nobody intends for anything bad to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| Nobody intends to go bankrupt or lose their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| Nobody intends any bad thing to happen, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| It still happens sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| It's interesting that we put the general fund and the debt service in place as our backups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8690)|
| 2:24:55| because this group was not willing to dip into either one for even less than a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8695)|
| 2:25:04| But we're going to use those as our backup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| In fact, we don't even know if using the debt service is even legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| I think that we need a ruling from the law department on that before we even sign this contract, if we sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8712)|
| 2:25:21| And as far as risk, what happens if we sign this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| and you say that the developers or the IDB or whatever is carrying the risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| Well, we've signed a contract saying that we're going to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| If we don't pay them and we decide we can't, you think they're going to be okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| No, they're going to sue us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| They're going to sue us because we promised to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| The risk is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8749)|
| 2:25:55| I'm very offended by the statement that selling off some of these assets will help us to live within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8755)|
| 2:26:07| Anybody who's talking about spending, and it's $15.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| that's the list that I want to see that adds up to $15.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| because we need an additional two and a half on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8774)|
| 2:26:21| Committing to spending almost $16 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| and not knowing where it's coming from and not having it available right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| that is not living within your means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| That is not what living within your means means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8791)|
| 2:26:42| I really hope that we will take this seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8802)|
| 2:26:51| and that we will realize what kind of position we're putting our community in by agreeing to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8811)|
| 2:26:57| without knowing where this money is coming from or how we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| And if you look at what's happened economically over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| I don't see how you can possibly be optimistic that it's going to be different the next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8826)|
| 2:27:16| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| You know, I just wanted to make a comment, and this is really to Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| and I know this came up at our last meeting about, you know, about the land out there at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| The county doesn't own that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| We don't control the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| We don't have anything at all to do with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| I guess we could go down here and, I mean, we have nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8851)|
| 2:27:38| That's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| That belongs to the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| So I think, you know, before we've had these comments come up about we could sell Midway, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8862)|
| 2:27:47| That's not Knox County's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| That doesn't belong to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| So that, I think, is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| I will make a comment about, again, selling some of the assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| And I agree that we need to sell some of the excess property that we're not using and get it back on the county's books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8876)|
| 2:28:03| I don't recall exactly what our fund balance is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| I was thinking it was somewhere in the neighborhood of about $39 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| But let's say we did sell $13 million worth of land, and rather than buying a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8892)|
| 2:28:20| that the school board and the people that are really responsible for properly allocating the resources say isn't necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8900)|
| 2:28:27| Let's say we put that money in the fund balance, where now all of a sudden we've got a fund balance of $52 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8907)|
| 2:28:34| Then some of these things that come up that we need, we would certainly have leeway to go into that fund balance and do something with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8914)|
| 2:28:43| I don't know if we would go to that extent if we didn't absolutely have to have the money to pay for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8923)|
| 2:28:50| But it certainly would put our credit rating in better shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| $52 million in our fund balance would change the whole game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| And that way, because we really do need to increase that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| The mayor is absolutely correct that all it would take is one disaster and we're broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| But that would put us in a whole new ball game for any growth that we do see on our revenues in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| that we can put those back into the community, whether it's in education, whether it's in building new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8956)|
| 2:29:22| And we don't have to be worrying about some of the things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| So I do support selling certain county properties that are considered excess properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| But I do want to get this business about midway off the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| The county does not own that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| And that's not something that the county can sell to help pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8977)|
| 2:29:44| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| I'm going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| Where I got my numbers was from the PEFA projections that came out in, I believe it was, 06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=8991)|
| 2:30:01| that said by 2016 Carter Elementary should be at 516 pupils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9001)|
| 2:30:11| We have 541 already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| We've already met that projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| And if we continue at the growth that we are, we won't be looking at another renovation because they're landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9016)|
| 2:30:23| You can't add any more onto that unless you dig into the side of that mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| So we're looking at building a new Carter soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| I mean, they've already met their capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| That's where I got my figures from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| Now, if that's wrong, then whoever made these up was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| So I question them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| I just got it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| The five million, if I'm correct, John, it's just sitting there waiting for us to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| the original two and a half for the renovation and the two and a half for the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| It's not approved, has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| I said it's waiting to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| So it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| It's just waiting for us to give the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| And if we approve this, then that will be the next thing that we turn around and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| And that's five million of that if you want to count the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| It's two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| Well, count the middle school because the school board was adding a middle school gym on there as more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9075)|
| 2:31:23| That's 18-something million minus this five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| We're down to the 13.3 or whatever that we're allocated for or obligated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9086)|
| 2:31:33| I think it's – I think what the mayor is trying to do, and I agree with this because this is what the private sector does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| When they go to build something, they pay cash for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| Or if they go to purchase something, they pay cash for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| Because we're seeing – we're reaping the so-called rewards for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| I mean, it cost us 54 million, and we're an interest-only loan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9114)|
| 2:31:59| Once we start paying on the principal, it's going to be well over $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| I would rather pay cash 13.3 for a school and not pay interest on it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| That's what we need to get to the position of being at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| If it means building up our reserve fund or general fund to where we owe nothing, I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9132)|
| 2:32:20| It wasn't too long ago, two months ago, that people were up here saying that it's not as bad out there as the mayor is projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9140)|
| 2:32:27| That, oh, we're not in dire straits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| And now, two months later, we're in dire straits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| We can't spend any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| So, I mean, it's either one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| I mean, I said two months ago, yes, it is bad out there in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| Did I think that we would get $2 million for Solway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| I figured it would come in around $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| We got $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| That is more than our estimate of the property was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| I'll take that deal any day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| And I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| And we do need to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| Now, there is tons of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| And I was the one that said it earlier that we need to start building new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| Renovation is not going to work every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| These schools are too old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| So we're either going to have to rebuild them and put new ones in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| And just that's landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| I mean, Bearden Elementary, I don't know where you would add on to that if we ever had to do that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| And we will have to do that one eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| We're going to have to do all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9211)|
| 2:33:32| Adrian Burnett should be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| The capital improvement plan has been changed several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9214)|
| 2:33:38| Eight years ago, Carter Elementary was on that capital improvement plan to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9218)|
| 2:33:44| It got knocked off to build Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| So they get changed all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| Needs change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| Things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| If we don't build it, we're going to be building a new one out there in a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| I can see it coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| I can make a substitute motion to pass without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9243)|
| 2:34:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| I only have a couple of comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| I was going to try to pick up on what Commissioner Ornby said about or, well, no, lots of people have said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9252)|
| 2:34:19| Why is Carter number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| Why are we dragging them to the top of the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| We are not dragging them anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| Carter was on the capital plan last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| Everything else on the capital plan from last year is being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| Nothing was dragged out and grilled for two and a half hours in the capital plan last year at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9272)|
| 2:34:39| In fact, the only 30 seconds it was expended on last year's capital plan was me stumbling through saying, wait a minute, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9279)|
| 2:34:49| I'd like to talk about Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| So Carter is number one because the school board has put it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9291)|
| 2:34:56| All their other number ones are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| I look back at last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| PAL had a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| Cedar Bluff had a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| I went to both of those ribbon cuttings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| There's nothing you can do at Carter to make Carter look like PAL or Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| This past week, I think, this is a comment to my personal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9318)|
| 2:35:24| I think this past week I went to the ribbon cutting at Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| attended ribbon cutting at the not built from the ground up school, the STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9330)|
| 2:35:37| There is no way Carter Elementary can be made to look like either of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9337)|
| 2:35:43| especially at Ball Camp because I believe it was built in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| Well, let me back up and just say my observation is it had all concrete floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9348)|
| 2:35:55| If that's something that wants to be done at Carter, let's have all concrete floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9355)|
| 2:36:03| Well, the first thing we're going to have to worry about is water coming up through some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| but that would do away with some classroom count that would then have to be new classroom count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9367)|
| 2:36:13| I think I'm getting myself way far afield from where we really are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9373)|
| 2:36:22| The thing that I have seen that I have witnessed for the last hour and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| or whatever we've been listening to this discussion has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9387)|
| 2:36:36| and I don't want anyone to take offense at this because it sort of embarrasses me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| everyone's talking about me and mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9403)|
| 2:36:48| We're not getting this for, and then you put a name to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9408)|
| 2:36:54| All those other things, all those other places need to be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| They're just not on the list yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| We are at a place on the list which is only Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9422)|
| 2:37:17| I have attended the school board meetings for over a year or around a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| The things we've discussed here for the last couple hours are issues that the school board took a month at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9445)|
| 2:37:34| on individual issues to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| It's taken them a year to get to where they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| The school board's not given up any authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| The school board, I think, has looked at fairly objectively a proposition that started with commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9464)|
| 2:37:54| and holding up a capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9474)|
| 2:37:59| The mayor of Knox County looking through three or four different options of trying to get to a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9479)|
| 2:38:08| and school board has the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| I even went so far as to get the consent or the order of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9492)|
| 2:38:19| and in the very first paragraph, the sentence says the Board of Education has exclusive right to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9499)|
| 2:38:25| and control the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| That's the print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| We wouldn't be talking about this today if the school system did not somewhat agree with the position that I've held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9510)|
| 2:38:39| for the last year and a half or the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9519)|
| 2:38:46| It's going to be difficult for me to take the six or seven page of raw notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9526)|
| 2:38:52| and repeat to you everything you said about the school board members that voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9532)|
| 2:39:00| Really, what I should be talking about are the five school board members that voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9540)|
| 2:39:09| I shouldn't be talking about whoever was next on the list, New Hope Willow or Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9549)|
| 2:39:20| That's not what's before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| I think one of the questions that is before us is where's the money going to come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9563)|
| 2:39:28| The money's going to come from here if we vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| I think we say that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| We're the buck stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| It's not going to be what the mayor, he's not going to roll out his wallet, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| and write a $10 million check this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| Now, if Bill Gates came in here and said here's $10 million, I'm sure we would take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| This is a difficult decision that's before us because Carter is the number one concern in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9589)|
| 2:39:56| It's not the number one concern in all of your individual districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| but it is the number one concern in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| because the school board's placed it there before us in that stature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| I really, truly want you to look back at my notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| and think for just a second about what is best for Knox County, not a promise that was made years gone by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| but even though those promises were made to the 8th District but never fulfilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| because maybe we went and did something else, it has nothing to do with where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| We're today where we are with Carter Elementary School because things haven't been done there this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9628)|
| 2:40:36| While we've looked at it, while school board's looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| and while now school board is ready to accept this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| if we're willing to work with the mayor, if we're willing to work with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| if we're willing to do whatever I think, no, it's not whatever I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| it's whatever might be right for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| And the right thing right now is going to be to get off of the drainage problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| that confronts the six-acre site where Carter Elementary School sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| I'd like to ask Mr. Dillingham, would you mind coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| and answering a couple of questions about school construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9675)|
| 2:41:25| I remember well the debate about schools in Knox County and the costs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| And in taking a look at it, we could build a school in Knox County probably for five, six, seven million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9691)|
| 2:41:37| but you're looking at probably materials that would probably not last very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| I'm talking about maybe a tin roof or something of that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| I'm not being facetious when I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| So I wanted to ask you, could we build a school that would meet the school system standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| And we've already heard that you all set the standards for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| Could we build a school at Carter Elementary which would house approximately six, seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9716)|
| 2:42:01| eight hundred students for five million dollars that would meet your standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9721)|
| 2:42:07| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools Facilities, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| In my opinion, no, we cannot, not for that number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9734)|
| 2:42:20| I think it's possible to build one if we lowered our standards somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| a building that I don't think would last quite as long as what we build right now for less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9746)|
| 2:42:35| But I think that you're probably still looking at a construction cost of somewhere between eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9755)|
| 2:42:42| and ten million for a facility of that size plus the FF&E and technology cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9762)|
| 2:42:50| So you would have to lower your standards, though, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| And you all would have to go back and take a look at it and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| perhaps we don't need extra room for this or we don't need extra room for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| or the school would have to do without certain amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| I think that is a somewhat fair statement, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| I know that during this process every developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| every team that came in and talked to the committee going through this process was asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9788)|
| 2:43:16| They were specifically asked that, okay, we hear a lot of comments about how counties surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9796)|
| 2:43:25| Knox County build school facilities for a lot less money than what Knox County spends on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| that we get gouged in what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| And every group said that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| You guys get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| In order to build something comparable to what surrounding counties are building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| you will have to lower your program standards in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| And that would certainly be an option, but that's not something that the school board has chosen to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| You've been involved in school construction for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| How long have you been involved in school construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| I have been with Knox County Schools since August 1, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| So I just celebrated my tenth anniversary with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| I've been in the architectural field for, we'll say, in excess of 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9851)|
| 2:44:16| So I guess my point is that as we look at a project manager, you're qualified to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| I mean, you've overseen these types of things before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| I've been practicing for a long time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| Don't go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| I don't know if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| Well, I'll go ahead and ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| Commissioner Wright was saying that Carter was the number one in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9879)|
| 2:44:47| And based on what I think was the, and he may correct me, please do if I'm incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9887)|
| 2:44:55| is the fact that you all presented Carter for renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9895)|
| 2:45:00| You all saw a need at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| and you put it forth in the capital improvement plan for funding this year right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9902)|
| 2:45:09| What else was in that capital improvement plan as far as renovations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| Or maybe it was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| Four votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| It may have been a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| I don't know when it first was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| That was last year's capital plan, the 2010-2011 capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| And Carter was the only major project that we had on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| We are beginning to do some deferred maintenance-type projects at Gresham Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9930)|
| 2:45:36| and at Chilhowee Intermediate School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| And then in the near future, we also have identified some at Fountain City Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9939)|
| 2:45:45| But these are really deferred maintenance projects that are being spread out over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9945)|
| 2:45:53| And it's really to try to hold our funding level down somewhat at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9953)|
| 2:46:00| But I guess all those were presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| I think what the commissioner is probably referring to is the fact that in the spring of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| the school board identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| and approved five sort of major capital funding priorities for the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| And that did include a project at the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| So that was one of the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| It was the construction of a new middle school gymnasium, site work at the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| and a major renovation of the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| The others include Chilhowee Intermediate School, as Mr. Dillingham said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| a new green addition, an environmentally-friendly addition at Bell Morris Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=9997)|
| 2:46:44| a new elementary school in the southwest sector of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| and a new STEM Academy High School in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| Those were the five capital planning priorities that the Board of Education adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| and has affirmed in the last two capital plans, capital improvement plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10016)|
| 2:47:02| that they have approved in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| So those were presented as one entity that had those different components to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| Those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| So my bottom-line point is you've not heard me mention one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| You've not heard me complain about one school in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| I've not mentioned any other school in any other district in all of my talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10042)|
| 2:47:29| The reason being is I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| Carter is standing on its own merit and not being compared to any other school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10053)|
| 2:47:36| I do think we're short-sighted in looking at this funding mechanism to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| That's the big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| That and the escalating costs and all the rigmarole that got us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| But the superintendent mentioned Chihuly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| I think it's a perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| It's 15 years older than Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| Same type build, basic brick build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| It's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| You've not heard me complain one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| Because it's an established community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10086)|
| 2:48:12| The projections, the same projections that the superintendent made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10092)|
| 2:48:17| I understand what's happening with Chihuly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| It's going to be a fairly stable intermediate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| It needs a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| I mean, the highly concerned parents, people of really engaged neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| but I think they also understand it needs a major renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| To couch this as one against the other, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| To me, it's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| The process has to yield the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| When you're dealing with 88 schools in nine districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| and all kinds of communities within those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| we can't let emotion get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| We have to let the experts and the engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| and the folks that truly understand school construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10145)|
| 2:49:12| and whether a project can be built, can be renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| can be made whole to get rid of the smells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10155)|
| 2:49:20| and to get rid of the plumbing problems and the electrical problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| or whatever have you, that we need to let them do their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10163)|
| 2:49:29| And this has been, again, four votes on this, and here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| So I don't think anything was said here or in any of the school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10173)|
| 2:49:39| which I have been monitoring as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| But, again, I just wanted to address the number one concern issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10186)|
| 2:49:47| It wasn't number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10187)|
| 2:49:48| It was with a package of number ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| And then to say this is we've been told time and time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10191)|
| 2:49:57| Renovation is the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| I think superintendent has told us that at least two or three times, that renovation is the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10198)|
| 2:50:04| He went out and viewed other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| and other communities and came back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| So I think we've done our due diligence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| Motion on the floor is to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| We will take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10219)|
| 2:50:20| We'll take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| Come back at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10221)|
| 2:50:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110815?start=10250)|
