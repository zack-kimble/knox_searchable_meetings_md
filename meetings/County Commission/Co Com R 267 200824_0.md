| 0:01:19| Commissioner J. here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Commissioner bigs, we have 9 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| Thank you. Commissioner big said he might be, uh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| So, all right, next item on the agenda, uh, commissioner Jay, would you please, uh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=93)|
| 0:01:41| Lead us in the devotional for this evening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am, uh, very happy to welcome my friend, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=101)|
| 0:01:51| Daryl tester, Daryl Arnold, who is going to lead us today and I welcome him to take the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| Video well, thank you so much to the entire commission. Also, especially to the chair and also to my friend, Jay, very grateful for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=117)|
| 0:02:09| I want to apologize for not generally being in a, I'm generally in a blue suit and a bow tie, but today I'm with my sons and we're actually in the woods fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=129)|
| 0:02:19| And so this morning, I told him, I spend time with them fishing and when he called, I said, I'll just do both at the same time. The 1st thing I told them to do is to spray to spray some bug spray on them to make sure that they were protected when they came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=139)|
| 0:02:32| And then we've got the fishing and didn't catch anything for hours and they were ready to go. And I'm trying to teach them the importance of just sticking with it and being patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=152)|
| 0:02:41| And then in about 20 minutes, 20 minutes before I was about to cut to call in man, small mouth, just start biting. And I just really felt like that's what the Lord wanted to talk to me to you all about is that I think that we need to make sure that we're protecting ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=161)|
| 0:02:57| I think we need to be ensure that our leadership is difficult and sometimes we got to be patient. And if we'll continue to be persistent and keep casting, we'll eventually catch what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=177)|
| 0:03:08| And so those are the 3 things that I want to pray over your lives and over the, those that will be watching via zoom is that they will be protected, that they will be patient and that they, that they will persevere father in the name of Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=188)|
| 0:03:20| I thank you for the opportunity to be able to serve in devotion today. I thank you for every person that is on this zoom call for this whole entire commission and how diligently they serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=200)|
| 0:03:32| I pray Lord, first of all, that you would protect them Lord, not just with, with bug spray and bug repellent Lord, but that you protect them with your angels or this is a difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=212)|
| 0:03:42| People are dying every single day of a disease that we didn't know anything about 6 months ago. And so father, I ask that your angels be assigned to each and every 1 of them, their community, their districts, but more than anything, their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=222)|
| 0:03:55| Secondly, Lord, I pray God that you would give them patience. It is very difficult to be a leader right now, whether it be in government, whether it be in ministry, whether it be in our own homes is difficult to be a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=235)|
| 0:04:07| So I pray that you would give us patience, patience to trust you and to know that although we're trying to figure it out, you got, you already have it worked out. And then lastly, Lord, I pray for perseverance that we would not be weary and well doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=247)|
| 0:04:20| We just keep on casting because we know that the answers is in the water. We know that you're eventually going to provide answers for the salute for the questions that we have and and solutions for the problems that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=260)|
| 0:04:31| So I pray that you would bless this meeting. We decree and declare the fact that the blessing of the Lord rests upon each and every person in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you so much for the opportunity. God bless you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=271)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you for joining us and good words and good luck as you continue to catch. I'm sorry, my son, if he had been watching this, he would have loved that. He would ask what you guys were using as bait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| Can't tell all the secrets, brother. Can't tell all the secrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| Yeah, thank you. Thank you for joining us. Yes, sir. All right. Thank you. All right. Moving on. Commissioner Carringer, would you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance to our nation's flag? Absolutely. I want to acknowledge that I see Commissioner Beeler just popped in there. Good to see you, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=301)|
| 0:05:21| Would everybody stand, please? And I have the flag behind me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| we will salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=328)|
| 0:05:50| Thank you. Yes, thank you, Commissioner Carringer. Moving on to the agenda, before we jump into public forum, I would like to, as we do at many of these meetings when we've got honorary resolutions, I would like to go ahead and, frankly, we've got one special person from Outsider Commission and then we've got some honorary resolutions for our county commissioners that are going to be, this is going to be their last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=350)|
| 0:06:20| One of them. So, Madam Clerk, what I'd like to do is go ahead and begin the honorary resolutions. I also know that Mr. Stevenson, who is, he's, he is watching the meeting from home, so he's not zoomed in, but I know that Mr. Bear Stevenson and Shirley are watching the meeting tonight. So, Madam Clerk, would you call the first honorary resolution, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=380)|
| 0:06:48| Steve, Randy's got a question. Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for watching that. Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to defer the commission and law director's resolution. I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| I would prefer to honor you guys in a way that you're all deserving of when we can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| have, have a meeting where you can come with your family and we can do our due respects for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| if you guys wish it to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Well, I know I would because I had a granddaughter who was very excited to be able to come up and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| everybody today. I'll second that. Okay. Commissioner Gill, you have any take on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=446)|
| 0:07:40| I'm not sure. Commissioner Gill, you may be on mute. I don't have a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| I kind of fall into the don't have a preference category just because, you know, we can easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| come back to be recognized if it suits the body. I mean, would one option be to go ahead and pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=471)|
| 0:08:00| the resolutions tonight and then bring the body back for, in the future date for a recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| ceremony where it can be done in person? That could be kind of where you have the best, have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| both worlds take care of. I mean, you never can tell. It might be a long time before we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| you know, where it works, or it could be a month. But it seems, in my opinion, I'd like to maybe at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| least get it done and then we can invite everybody back for the, you've got to actually give people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| these certificates and we could, everybody could come back when we meet in person after they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| been passed. And I think it'd be kind of neat for the commissioners here on this body to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| vote on and pass the resolutions that they're being honored with. At least that's my two cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| worth. So, is that a good compromise, Mr. Smith? Or what do you all think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=522)|
| 0:08:52| I'm willing to do whatever this body wants to do, especially what you four are willing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| are wanting to do. I just wanted to make sure that you all get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| recognition ceremony and respect that you deserve for the service you've all provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| to this community. Commissioner Carringer, would you be opposed if we pass them tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| then everybody came back where they might be read again for a more formal meeting in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| No, I don't have a problem. I just had a granddaughter who was looking forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| being there tonight, seeing all of you all. And then I had to disappoint her Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| I know she loves all of you all and would love to be able to see you all again. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| but I'm fine whatever everybody wants to do and whatever makes it easiest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Well, let's do this. It'd be my preference to go ahead and pass them tonight. And then whoever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| next chair of the commission is and the next commission body, you know, working as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| the next in-person meeting is, and it could be as soon as the end of September, could bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| everybody back to formally actually give and present these certificates to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| That might be a way to kind of have our cake and eat it too, if that's okay with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| Is that okay with, you know, Brad, you're awfully quiet on this. Where are you at, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| I have no preference. We can do it. We improve them and get them out of the way and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| come back. I would like to come back, but I think it'd be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Well, me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Yeah, I can be clear. My wife was actually going to come to a commission meeting, which usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| she's downstairs working and watching it on TV. So, yeah, that, well, if it pleases the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| we'll go ahead and go ahead and get these done. And then whoever the next commission is and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| our peers who are still on the body, if you all could work with whoever you select as chair to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| bring us all back in September or October. And, you know, there could be times where our schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| it might be hard to get all four of us back. So, you know, it could be where you do it one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| at a time depending on how, you know, how it is. So, with all that said, it'd be nice just to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| these done so you all don't have to worry about trying to fit them into a future agenda in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| event that some of us may hopefully someday be traveling again soon and might have a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| with the night where everybody else could be here. So, all right. So, with that said...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| You make the say, Chairman, that you're going to have something else to do on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| fourth Monday of every month. Come on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Actually, I usually have Boy Scout meetings on that day, on Monday nights. So, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| I'll be going back to Boy Scout meetings, to be quite honest. So, hopefully, we can work this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| for a comeback. So, with that said, Madam Clerk, would you go ahead and begin? I believe the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| one is Commissioner Gills, if you could read that one, and then we'll have a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| This is Resolution R-20-8-101. It's a resolution honoring Commissioner Evelyn Gill for her service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=694)|
| 0:11:43| on the Knox County Commission. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Second, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| Okay. All in favor of this resolution, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| I will not even do the nays. So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Do we not have to do roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Actually, we do have to do roll call. Thanks, Mr. Smith for... Mr. Law Director, would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| possible when we do a vote? Well, let's just do a quick roll call on these. So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=738)|

| 0:32:24| school system, for example, all of those were reviewed last week. Some of them were debated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| some of them were discussed, and they've been put together so that tonight when we do our vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| we can vote on all of those together, especially when you think that under this electronic medium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| we have to do these roll call votes. Nobody wants to have a roll call vote on 60 different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| So what we've done is create a consent agenda for the schools. We've also got a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| for the regular county business. We've also got some things on the agenda that are related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| ordinances that have to be read and voted on at least twice, and several are up for the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| time. We also have, and if you've looked at the agenda, we have public forum listed on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| for both the beginning and the end, and I've had a lot of citizens sign up to speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| most of which are about the health department and the mask mandates. When we're meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| together in the main assembly room, what we usually do at these meetings is say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| because we have both a right and duty to conduct our business, so we can't have public forum go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| on for two hours and then not be able to actually get done what we do, I usually say, hey, can y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| pick a spokesperson and we'll give you, say, 15 minutes if the spokesperson leads it, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| we'll move on when everybody wants to speak on one subject. I realize tonight that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| going to be difficult to do, especially if so many folks have come in via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| So what we're going to do tonight is I've got, I'm going to let the first five folks who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| signed up in order of sign up speak at the first public forum, then I'll check our time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| everybody gets five minutes. We'll move on to getting the work done that we've got to do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| then if you'll notice, we do have a second public forum on our agenda, and we'll try to get to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| rest of folks that haven't had a chance to speak during that public forum. So I'm hopeful, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| watch the clock just to make sure that we can try to get everybody who wanted to speak to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| and move forward on that. So looking to my fellow commissioners, considering how many folks want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| speak at public forum, does that seem, as chair, it seems like the fairest way to do it so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| can balance everybody gets heard, yet we also still have a chance to get to, through our agenda, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| get the work done. So I'm seeing in the chat button, no hands raised. So generally, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| so that's what we'll do. We've got, I want to thank our IT department. So for sending out these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| links, but the first person who signed up for public forum is Mr. Rick Roach. So Mr. Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| if you're here, I think I saw you earlier in the waiting room. So Mr. Roach, you're recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| and you've got five minutes, Mr. Roach. All right. Thank you, Chairman. My name is Rick Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2100)|

| 0:35:16| where I'm coming from, I am a lifelong Knoxville native. I raised two children here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2116)|

| 0:35:51| and that was from the work session. I was just looking for an avenue in which to come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| to offer my comments, but it does have to do entirely with the whole COVID-19 situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| that we have going on here in Knox County and in the country as a whole, in the world as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| Specifically, the testing, the laboratory testing that goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2171)|
| 0:36:21| and the contract with Premier is an example of this. Knox County is in serious catch-up mode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| with this COVID-19 situation, and we've had a lot of controversy about compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2187)|
| 0:36:37| from the masks to businesses, hours that they keep, the protocols for consumers and particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2197)|
| 0:36:47| businesses as they enter and exit those businesses. And even at the work session Monday, last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2207)|
| 0:36:56| I observed a group of people come in unmasked, and they were not safe distancing. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| actually, one of them kind of said something to me as I looked at them, and like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| why aren't you doing what the rest of the folks here are voluntarily doing? And he kind of had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| a word for me, and I'll let that pass. However, I really want to focus on this, and it has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2238)|
| 0:37:29| with how the county overall is handling, whether it's the health department, whether it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| mayor's office, whether it's you, county commission. There's no consistency. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| no coming together and saying, we're going to do this, and we're all going to go by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| and this is the way it's going to be, okay? And we're all going to example the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| behavior in order to deal with this pandemic. We've had the mayor not go covered in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2271)|
| 0:38:02| and in close quarters to other people, yet we can't even get a true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2282)|

| 0:38:21| I've had to listen to people and their concerns about the school system and the proper protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| and the reassurance even from teachers to staff members to students and parents, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2309)|
| 0:38:38| There's a lot of fear. There's a lot of worry going on out there. I remember listening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2318)|
| 0:38:48| Commissioner Bussler questioning Dr. Buchanan last week and offering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2328)|
| 0:38:59| asking some very hard questions, and I think she handled it pretty well. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2339)|
| 0:39:08| I questioned her beyond that as she was leaving, and because I had some specific things that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| come to my attention, and that is how the county is handling particular situations as regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2356)|
| 0:39:26| county employees in particular public locations such as schools, libraries, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2366)|
| 0:39:37| And I don't think there's a consistency going on here in terms of when a potential county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| has come in contact with someone who has tested positive or they have tested positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| and then that there is proper notification of everyone who has come in contact with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| The protocols have not been applied correctly or equally. People talk, but they're afraid to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| publicly and discuss this. Mr. Birch, you've got about 30 seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| Okay. So I would just want you all to consider this, and maybe it can be discussed further on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| down the line and some hard questions can be asked, especially from the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| and our human resources as to what the protocols are. And keep in mind that if they say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| no, this is the way we're doing things, well, we have some information out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| that maybe that's not the way things are going. Okay? I conclude my comments. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| All right. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Roach. Okay. The next citizen on the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2446)|

| 0:41:47| due to malfeasance and ineptness. This virus has been made out to be the harbinger of death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| and it's smart enough, it appears to distinguish between Walmart and churches gatherings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| protesting, rioting in bars. It's able to tell time. It's been used as a quintessential excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2518)|

| 0:42:16| It's caused community discord, and in some situations, acts of violence when one makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| a decision not to wear a mask. Now, I've got a lot of information. I'm going to try to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| very, very short and sweet and to the point. By the way, Mr. Henry, I'd say if you got the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2547)|

| 0:42:36| trying. It just won't. Oh, I understand. Oh, there you are. There I am. When technology works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| it works wonderfully, and when it doesn't, it works terribly. One of the things that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| trying to bring across is that the WHO and the CDC considers the wearing of masks essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| because classifying the large number of individuals in the United States is asymptomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Let's look at the real numbers throughout the world. We have 7.8 billion people on the planet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| yet we've lost 181,000. That critical fatality rate is 0.01. The United States at 331 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2587)|

| 0:44:09| concerning with the state record of COVID-19 deaths in Knox County, which apparently stands at 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| What has been brought forth by several medical staff is the actual death due to or with CV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| was an autopsy performed to confirm stated reason. If autopsy was not conducted, why and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| authorized the lack of confirmation? If CV was not the cause of death and was listed as the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| cause, is the hospital not guilty of fraud to secure federal funding? And if so, is the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=2679)|

| 0:57:55| He may have said his piece and moved on. But I would say Drusilla might have it. So, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| moving on. Thank you, Ms. Houston. The next citizen we have is Kim Sprague. I hope I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| pronouncing that right. Kim, please correct me if I have not. But if you're here, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| please, Mr. Link, if you could let her in. Ms. Sprague, are you here? All right, no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3493)|
| 0:58:31| All right, we'll move on. Is she here? Are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| Some of us were having problems with the audio. Okay. All right. I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| Can you hear me now? Yes, we can. Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| Okay. It said the host muted me. So, I was like, no, no, don't go on. I don't know if you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| me. It's a shame if you can't because my face... Well, we can see a big pink K. So, there might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| be a camera thing on there. See if you can get your camera to turn on, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| Okay. I think, okay, the host was... There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Okay. I don't know if you can see, but I normally have clear skin and I have big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| humongous sores that my teenagers think is hilarious. They call me pepperoni face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| tables are turned. That's from wearing my mask. But anyways, the reason I'm here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| first, I have to say, I just moved here from another state. So, I don't know if you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| that. I moved here from another state and it's a state that I was driven out of by the lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| liberties, to be honest with you. And so, when I found out that we have a board that is appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| that is relatively lacking accountability as far as the spirit of a representative government goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| I was really disappointed to see that here in Tennessee. That being said, this particular board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| it's a health board. Are they competent in handling the scope of mandates that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| issuing? And I would say they are not. I am not a healthcare provider, but I am a mental healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| provider. I'm a LCSW. You have my name. I'll give you my address. It's 12017 Englecrest Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3613)|
| 1:00:25| Knoxville, 37934. And I would say that I'm seeing, you know, I don't know exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| their licenses are in the health field, but they seem to be very myopic and really missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| a lot of other health issues that are collateral damage to their mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| starting with the economic hardships brought along by curfews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| As a mental health provider, I'm dealing with a lot of people in crisis. I'm seeing a spike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| in suicides. In my role, I do work with children. I'm seeing an increase in anxiety-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| disorders. Those may seem like nebulous things, but there are specific causes that bring increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3665)|
| 1:01:15| in suicide and anxiety. It's things like isolation and hopelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| You know, one of your speakers that supports the mandates, and it sounded like wants them even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| stricter and enforced more, said there's a lot of fear and worry. And yes, there's a lot of fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| and worry. And I wonder how founded in reality it really is. Other people have mentioned the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| rate of illness and death, and is that really equitable to the amount of fear and worry that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| we're casting on people? When you have people that are so afraid that, as the Journal of American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| JAMA, Journal of American, I'm not a doctor, but the health board should know what JAMA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| They had a recent peer-reviewed article, and it said, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| fear-related extreme isolation from COVID-19 is causing increased mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3726)|
| 1:02:17| That goes to increased fears that are causing anxiety, stress, people whose finances have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3737)|
| 1:02:28| cut back, additional stress, not having food, not having enough money to buy their medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| And I think that the health board needs to ask themselves, are children going hungry? Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| healthy? Are people going without meds, is that healthy? People feeling so afraid and causing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| other health issues, mental and physical, is that healthy? And I wonder, as health providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| if they've been so myopically focused on COVID-19 that they're missing all these other health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| issues. You may or may not know that research has shown more than ever that one of the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| factors in suicides is isolation. By putting people in masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| we are causing a form of isolation. By making people afraid of this virus to the degree that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| we are, we are putting people into isolation. Look at our children. So many of them aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| in schools. That isolation, as well as the hopelessness that we are spurring on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3806)|
| 1:03:35| both are humongous contributors to suicides. And you all know that the suicide rates are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| Domestic violence rates are off the roof right now. Child abuse is really high right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Those are being increased by the anxiety and fear that I believe the masks are endorsing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3826)|
| 1:03:55| and pushing forward. And I would just say that this health board is not looking at all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| other health issues, both physical and mental health issues. And I think they're incompetent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| I think that they're way out of their league. And I really ask that they be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| reviewed and that their powers be cut back. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Thank you. Thank you. We're at a point in the meeting where we're just past the one-hour mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| And I would like for us to go ahead and begin the actual work that we've got to accomplish tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| before we come back to public forum. So this should be roughly almost at a halfway mark for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| those of you who are also here on public forum. So I'm going to move on, although right now might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| be a good spot, if there are any questions on this. You know, we've had some folks bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| the mask questions and this. I remember at the work session, Commissioner Anders had proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3885)|
| 1:04:53| a question to the law director about some of these that were proposed. So what I might do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3893)|
| 1:05:02| is just kind of more as a follow-up to the citizens that have brought this. I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| Sanders has done some research on this. And Mr. Anders, could you restate your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| that you brought up last week at the work session? Yeah, I just want the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| office to kind of talk about what happens if we eliminate or remove or what's caused. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| I mean, it sounds simple enough, but what's the reality to it? And I hope that he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| touch on that for us. Sorry, go ahead and respond, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, Mr. Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3930)|
| 1:05:39| you're recognized. All right. So the question essentially is posed is whether or not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| County Commission has the power to remove members of the Board of Health, and if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3947)|
| 1:05:56| under what circumstances? And then several sort of cascading questions about what would happen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| those circumstances. I think if you look at the applicable Tennessee code, it mandates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3963)|
| 1:06:13| membership of the board. It does give the County Commission the authority to remove members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3973)|
| 1:06:23| for cause, unquote. But it's really important for the County Commission to understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| for cause does not mean that one disagrees with the policies that the Board of Health is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=3990)|
| 1:06:40| up with or regulations that they enact. It does not mean you disagree with the science that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4000)|
| 1:06:49| base their opinions on. Cause in very simple terms means fraud, malfeasance, or moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4009)|
| 1:06:59| That more or less means, and I've noticed a lot of the speakers have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| malfeasance because the board is selecting certain scientific propositions over others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| That's not what malfeasance means in this circumstance. Malfeasance in this circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| for to occasion a removal of a board member by this body would need to be something along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| lines of committing a crime in office. This is not something that is, the statute is not designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| for the board, for this body to reach into the board and remove a member simply because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| like what the board is doing. I'm not sure if that is a reasonable place to start. Perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4056)|
| 1:07:46| the, perhaps you can follow up with whatever question you have beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4066)|
| 1:07:53| I was going to say, I'll look in the chat function if anybody tries to raise their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| hand. I'm trying to look over here at my fellow commissioners if anybody's got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4079)|
| 1:08:11| And frankly, if you've got it, let me get it on the gallery view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Okay. All right. Any commissioners have a question? Just raise your hand. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4096)|
| 1:08:25| Commissioner Anders, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Well, I think it, I mean, it's not on the agenda tonight for a vote. And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| consultation with the new commissioners, because if we try to add this to the agenda or if we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| I mean, it's not been publicly noticed, I think it'd be unwise. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| in giving it to the next commission of four different new commissioners to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| I think they need to kind of deal with it, peel the onion back with the law director's office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| have a conversation about it. I philosophically don't agree with everything that the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| board has done. But I don't know that I want to go down the road of removing members just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| we don't philosophically agree with them. I think that, I mean, they're all positions or from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| organizations that were recommended or required by state law. And if you remove them, you have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| health board, you have no quorum. And those organizations may or may not send in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| different names. They may send in the same names. Nobody may be willing to serve after what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| going through right now. So, I think that a conversation needs to be had. And then maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| they need to explain their processes better. Maybe they need to, you know, look into their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| other issues that the public brings up. But as this board tries to remove them, I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| it kind of sets us back to where we don't have one. And then what happens with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| if we don't have a functioning health board is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Dr. Lowe Well, I mean, me personally, my biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| challenge is operational because there's not a resolution related to this that's on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| for tonight. And anything that is of such importance, we would have wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| that we had publicly noticed because as many arguments as the folks who've been with us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| or have emailed us, there's also a lot of members of the public that feel opposite. And if this were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| something that we're going to vote on tonight, you'd want it to have made sure that you publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| noticed that a vote would be taking place so that folks in the public who have a belief one way or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| the other really need to know so that they can advocate for their positions to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| And in this case, that we just don't have a resolution in front of us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| would have warranted public notice to move on it. So, I guess, Commissioner Anders, I'm agreeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| with you on that. And I'll look to that notice around, if I see a Commissioner Smith, to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| notice regarding public notice, I'll look to the law director on that. And right now, I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Gill. So, I'm going to prompt a question to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| around that public notice aspect of this, then we'll go to Smith, Gill, Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| I don't know whether Mr. Boock wants me to respond to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| question of public notice, but I think I can easily, not as long as I'm on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| concur that such an item would need to be public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you. We'll go Smith, Gill, Carringer, Bussler. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like for the law director to follow up on what Brad ended on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| What would happen if we did remove these people from their position, the institutions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| charged with giving us names, gave us the same names, or refused to give us any more names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| What would happen with the state? Will we fall back under the state? Do we know what that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| do for our funding for our health department? Could you tell us what the process would be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| that? All right, Mr. Smith, some of it I would have to speculate on, and some of it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| couldn't happen the way you're describing, but I'll try to get into as much as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| The statute, again, directs the number and the composition of this board, and the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4329)|
| 1:12:20| states that these societies nominate members to the board, which you all, as the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| approve. So I've already opined that there have not even been allegations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| and if I have it stated clearly enough, not only do I not think there is cause to remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| members of the board of health, there have not even been allegations stated sufficient to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| the members of the board of health. The allegations that would be necessary to even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| have that inquiry, again, would amount to allegations of fraud, malfeasance, or moral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| turpitude, and nobody that I have seen or heard from so far has made any such allegation against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| any of these members. But hypothetically, if a board member, if sufficient number of members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| of the board somehow left the board, whether they resigned, whether they were run over by a bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| whatever, such that the board no longer had a quorum, which is a majority of its membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| so five members, if they no longer had a quorum, they would cease to function. They would cease to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| be able to pass new regulations, but they would still exist as a board. But they simply couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| do anything because they didn't have a quorum. Now, if this body wishes not to have a board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| health in Knox County, the only way that I see forward to do that is to revoke the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| or the, I'm sorry, the ordinance that establishes the board of health in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| If you revoke the ordinance that establishes a board of health in Knox County, I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| ordinance 38-33, then Knox County would no longer have a board of health, and the Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| the functions that are now being performed by the board of health would be performed by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| either the state commissioner of health or through the governor and his executive orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| as long as the governor has those emergency powers. So there really is no middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| You either have a board of health here in the county, or you have the state taking over those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| functions. Does the state have the power to refuse to take back those functions that we have requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| to have? I don't believe so. In essence, the state gives us, the statute reads that we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| have a board of health. And if we have a board of health, that board of health is entitled to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| certain things. The statute does not mandate we have a board of health. So if we don't, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| just like those other 86, 87, whatever counties that don't have a board of health, and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| looks to these issues, rather than the local board of health. Now, as far as issues like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| funding and such, I couldn't opine on that right now. I'm not aware that there would be any issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| but I just haven't looked at those issues. Would that mean that our health department employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| would become state employees, and we would lose control over some of the directions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| not the board of health, but our health department takes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| I believe board of health employees would remain county employees. But again, that's an issue I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| just simply not prepared to speak on authoritatively right now. As far as I understand it, the board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4544)|
| 1:15:53| health or the health department itself is also established by county ordinance, I think it's 3832.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| And it is under the mayor's office. But Dr. Buchanan as both health director and health officer of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4559)|
| 1:16:12| which are statutory positions, has a certain authority granted to her by statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4572)|
| 1:16:20| that are outside the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Next, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mrs. Sanders for clarifying the role of the board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| health and the health department. And I want to make a statement of support for both organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| And I know that there are people in the public who have said they disagree with the mass mandated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| ordinance. But I've been contacted by lots of constituents who understand we're in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| a pandemic. And that mass mandate is needed in order for our economies to open. Now, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| disagree with that process, then you need to disagree on the national level with the directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| that have been provided to the state and the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| Thank you, Chairman. Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment on it. And I thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4632)|
| 1:17:21| Commissioner Anders also for getting the description of what the board of health is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| But from doing a lot of door to door here in the last few months, this was one of the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| concerns or complaints, I should say, by the people that I knocked on the door. It was more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| of what they were being told to do instead of worried about the coronavirus. And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| what's been really frustrating, I think, to all of us as commissioners is that we've received I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| know how many emails and phone calls of people thinking it's us. Because Mayor Jacobs votes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4676)|
| 1:18:05| this board, they have immediately thought that it was county commissioners voting and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| why did you vote that way? Why did you, you know, and so going out and trying to explain it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| public has been very difficult in, you know, our hands being tied as to, you know, what we do. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4696)|
| 1:18:27| you know, that has been a big plus for Knox County, the fact that we do have our own board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| of health, and we don't have to, you know, do like all the other counties that do come under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| state. So, you know, from having family in the medical practice and all, masks, if everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4718)|
| 1:18:48| wearing masks, they do prevent others from coming in contact with this. And until, as I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4728)|
| 1:18:57| until we definitely have medication that we know works, until we have a vaccine, like we can treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| the flu and, you know, you choose whether or not to get the vaccine, that there is medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| that does work. Until we have these things in place, as Pastor Arnold just said in his devotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4749)|
| 1:19:18| we have all got to care about other people and we've all got to be patient and continue to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| through this because our economy cannot suffer another close down. So, you know, it's really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4764)|
| 1:19:33| matter of respecting each other and common sense and taking care of ourselves as well as other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4773)|
| 1:19:41| people. It's just like when we closed no smoking in restaurants, that was to protect other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| So, but anyway, it's a difficult thing. And as we've just heard from the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| it's not just simply, you know, you can get rid of the health board just because you may not like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| their stance or personality. So, I want to agree with Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| and Commissioner Smith and what they've said that I do think it's important for the next commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| to meet and decide which way they want Knox County to go on this very important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4815)|
| 1:20:24| which none of us ever really knew, you know, how important, I guess, that the health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| really was to Knox County. This is the first time. So, anyway, I do think it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| the new commission probably needs to take up in a very serious way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer. And the use of the chat function is just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| the county commissioners. After you've spoken at public forum, Rob, if you could go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| if you've already spoken, move over to watching the meeting via CTV or the link through, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4848)|
| 1:20:56| YouTube. But CTV is broadcasting the meeting. So, yeah. So, Rob, if you could go ahead and take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4856)|
| 1:21:05| if you've already spoken at public forum, use the chat and the, here, it's just for our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| for commissioners. Moving on, that was, thank you, Commissioner Carringer and Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4870)|
| 1:21:20| All right. Charlie, check your, there you go. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| Well, that's probably the best part of my speech is what you missed. But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| what I want to talk about was economical decisions made by the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I know a few businesses that have gone out of business because of being essential or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| non-essential. You have people that have loss of income. And these are important things. If you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| not producing, if you lose your business because you can't do business, because you're considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| non-essential, I'm not sure who's supposed to make that decision. Because we have big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| businesses that stayed in business that, because they had a grocery store inside their company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| and they sold also other things that were non-essential, what we said. They sold clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| they sold fishing goods, they sold everything else. But these companies that did have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| shops open couldn't be in business because they were specializing in one thing and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| lost those business. So, how can we look at the public and say, you have to shut down because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| consider you non-essential. They also pay taxes. And the small businesses pay more taxes than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4952)|
| 1:22:40| these large corporations to this government. And we some way along the line forgot the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| of those individual businesses. So, I don't know how we take care of that. I'm not giving anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| I'm not taking anything away from the health department. But I do think that when you make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| a decision to put somebody out of business, which they have, then there's got to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| sort of recourse for those individuals that have spent their life building a business up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| and then lose it over a pandemic that we're not sure, we know about the virus, we're learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| more about it each day. And me being home, because I was just close to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| is, I'm not used to being staying at home and my wife's about to shoot me for staying home because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| I have to do this because the health department required me to. So, I'm just saying when we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| these decisions, we got to take into other considerations than just the health issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| of being physically strong, but also mentally strong. And I see people going crazy over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| not being able to protect their businesses or their homes or provide for the family. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| we've got to do something on that end of it to make sure that we don't go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| this again and put so many people out of business. That's just the thought that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5041)|

| 1:24:22| Thank you, Chair. Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue. Just to clarify, Mr. Bussler, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| decision about essential, non-essential is actually a federal and state decision. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| not a local decision at all. That comes down from the federal government to established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| CISA is the acronym, but I can't remember what CISA stands for. But that came down from us from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| the feds and the state. So, it wasn't something that was made, a decision that was made locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| just to clarify for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5088)|

| 1:25:04| set the agenda for the rest of the meeting. So, I'm going to get my list out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5104)|

| 1:25:20| session last week, and we've got a lot of items that were put on consent. But we do have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5120)|

| 1:27:16| the IT department. Item 67 is the hotel tax second reading ordinance. And 68 is related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5236)|
| 1:27:24| the merit system. Other business, under other business, when we get to it, we will briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| discuss reorganization. So, any other changes to that proposed agenda? All right. Yes, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=5251)|

| 1:46:18| Carringer Fire Department, Seymour Volunteer Fire Department, and Knox County Rescue for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| the provision of fire rescue emergency services within their designated response areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| Okay. Can I get a vote on this one? I'm going to look before the motion. I'm going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| Commissioner Jay, you had mentioned you had an amendment or some extra information on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| you want to bring. So, I'll look to you to mention what you had going on there, and then we'll move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| from there to whatever the right motion is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm not sure what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| right motion is. If it's a substitute motion to the motion that's on the table here to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| as is. But I'd like to ask for each of the contracts to be amended to have the termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| clause be extended to 30 days. Right now, it's listed as five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| Would that be considered a friendly amendment? I might look to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| law director and I'll look at Dwight Vandeveid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| You can make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Let's go to the sponsor, which is Dwight's team, and let's see if that would be a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| amendment to him. Well, I don't know whether it's the bottom line is you don't have a motion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| the table. You've got to get that on the table. All right. Well, we'll go ahead. All right. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| so you've got a substitute motion. No, you can't have a substitute until you get a motion. Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| he can substitute. All right. Okay. Let's go ahead and all right. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| I make a motion that we approve with the change on each MOU changing it to a 30-day termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6462)|
| 1:47:50| clause instead of a five-day termination clause. All right. Seems fair. All right. We've got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| motion from Commissioner Anders, the second from Commissioner Jay. All right. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Mr. Vandeveid, are you there? Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. And we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| we're completely comfortable with the amendment. All right. Very good. Okay. All right. The motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| is properly before us as amended. The motion was made by Commissioner Anders, seconded by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6488)|

| 1:48:24| Is procurement fine with this or were they even involved with this at all? Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6504)|
| 1:48:39| He might not have. No, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| What was the question again to me? Was, were you involved in this process and are you comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| with changing the terms of the contract? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6532)|

| 1:50:05| Okay. Madam Clerk, what are the next few items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| The next item is number 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6609)|
| 1:50:20| Okay. Let's go with item 66, if you could read that one, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Which is Resolution 905. It's approving a contract with Microsoft Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| to provide enterprise software and operation system licensing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6628)|

| 1:50:47| Zach, it was just the timing of it. It was pulled originally from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| because we were just waiting to get a copy of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| and it all seems to be resolved. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| Yes, Chairman, that is correct. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6658)|

| 1:52:12| And for my fellow commissioners and the public and those who are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| waiting to speak at public forum and everybody for zoning, here's what I propose that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| We're going to go ahead and hear item 67. We then, we've got a relatively brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| zoning meeting tonight. Knock on wood, of course, how many times have one of us said we had a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| zoning meeting and that ended up taking two hours. But at least at face value, it looks relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| brief. So what I'd like to do is go ahead and do the second reading for item 67. Then we'll take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6759)|
| 1:52:48| five-minute break or so and come back. Randy, I saw you cringe on that one. We do need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| 10-minute break. Okay. All right. I thought you were opposed to breaks or something. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| all right. So we'll take a 10-minute break. And when we reconvene, we'll complete our land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| and zoning meeting. We'll then come back to the commission agenda. Now, Zach and Rob are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| I know that they want, I want to make sure it's very clear. When we did these meetings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| back in March, April, May, if you closed out of one Zoom, it kind of, it put that Zoom to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| However, and Rob, if you could please clarify by chiming in on this, someone's going to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| in the regular commission meeting Zoom to keep that Zoom room active while we go to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| Zoom room to hear the zoning part of the meeting. We'll then finish the zoning and land use. We will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| come back to the original county commission meeting, still alive in that other Zoom room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| We will go through finishing up the agenda. We've still got folks at public forum. We've still got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| the consent agenda for regular government consent calendar. So, Rob, if you could weigh in and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6834)|
| 1:54:02| of tell everybody how that process will go, then we'll hear item 67 and take the 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| And Commissioner Anders, you're recognized. Yeah. Can we do 68 instead of 67? I think we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| people holding on for that one. That's what I was wondering about 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Okay. Well, we can move 68. I just was curious. I knew there might have been some discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| that when I was trying to get these pushed through. Yeah, we can definitely do 68 now. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| Madam Clerk, and for anybody who's watching this via the CTV for zoning, it might run over a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| of minutes. If that's the case, we'll hear this one, then we'll come back to it. So, go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| and we'll hear item 68 now. So, Madam Clerk, if you could go ahead and read that one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| What about Mr. Link? Yeah. Or yeah, Mr. Link, tell us if I've stated everything correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| We can come back to the original Zoom. It'll still be alive. We can come back into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| Once we've closed it, that link will still be valid. We'll go into do the zoning part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| meeting, close that one. That one will go away. Then we can come back to the still active regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| Commission Zoom room, if that is correct. Mr. Link? Very close. This meeting will end. Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| will be the meeting will end. Those that are waiting to speak on public forum, when we come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| back, can reenter the waiting room. We will start the zoning meeting. When we come back from zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6915)|
| 1:55:22| into this commission meeting, the same link will work. So, this meeting will end, but the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| link will work when we're done with zoning, and we'll get back up and running on this link later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| Okay. That's exactly what I wanted to hear and clarify. Is that clear for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| We good? All right. Very good. So, go ahead. Madam Clerk, could you please introduce item 68?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| Item 68 is Ordinance O-20-7-102. It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| Article 2, Division 2, Section 42-58, entitled Competitive Tests, List of Eligibles, and Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| 42-59, entitled Filling of Vacancies, to establish timeframes for administering employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| candidate examination. This amends Ordinance O-90-9-111, adopted September 10th, 1990. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6966)|
| 1:56:14| is on second reading. So, I'll move. Second. All right. So, we've got a motion for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6974)|
| 1:56:22| from Commissioner Biggs and a second from Commissioner Carringer. Yeah, there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| discussion. Yes, Commissioner Jay? I'd like to make a substitute motion to defer this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| I've spent a little bit more time in the last few weeks reading over information about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| Merit Council, attending meetings, talking with our Sheriff. And I just think that there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| of ideas on how the Merit Council and the Sheriff could work better together and optimize things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7006)|
| 1:56:54| This hasn't been looked at in I don't know how long or if ever. And since it's a function of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| commission, I think it would be important for a few commissioners to sit down with both sides and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| find multiple improvements that might help instead of just bringing in piecemeal one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| And so, that's the motion I put up for a substitute motion, please. Okay. All right. Does the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7033)|
| 1:57:21| have a, does the substitute motion have a second? Okay. I'll go ahead and make the second. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7041)|
| 1:57:29| any additional discussion on this item? Yes, Commissioner, I'm recognizing and I'll go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| order. Smith, Gill, and Anders. Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith and then Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Sheriff told us at the last meeting that he is fine with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| And Commissioner Jay, I do understand that there are things that they can come together and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| on. But I think there is no need to hold up this one before we do the whole, before we get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| other changes that could be made. So, I support going ahead and passing this one as the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| said he was okay with it. And then exploring working with the Merit Council and the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| Department so that we can bring the rest of the changes all at one time. Okay. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| Commissioner Smith. And moving over to Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just simply echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| what Commissioner Smith just stated. And also, I think if this is a procedural component, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7105)|
| 1:58:35| then an opportunity for Commission to, at that point, because it's procedural, to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7115)|
| 1:58:43| the Merit Council to have a representative from Commission to, as we do the reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| to sit on and to develop that committee so that they can then seek to have representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| from Commission on the body. All right. Thank you. And Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7136)|
| 1:59:02| Well, I think it was, I was pretty much what Commissioner Smith was going to say. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| there's room for work to be done and a committee to be formed out of the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| Commission. But I think this Commission has this sitting here. I think we should clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| tonight. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Carringer? Yes, I agree. I mean, this is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7155)|
| 1:59:23| the second reading of it. And that's been saying a word. I think you should. I said he agrees with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7163)|
| 1:59:31| this and the Merit Council just said that to represent the officers, to give them a support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7171)|
| 1:59:39| group. So, in a word. So, I didn't know the Merit Council. I think the Merit Council has always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7179)|
| 1:59:46| worked well with the Sheriff's Office, as far as I've ever known or heard. So, I do think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| to go ahead with this tonight and move forward. Mr. Chairman, Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| Yes, the Chair recognizes Sheriff Spangler. Just let me clarify. I said I was okay with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| but it would be nice to be able to put this off just like with the other so that we can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| together whatever we need to put together and make it work. There are some issues and it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| nothing to do with the Merit Council's authority on discipline or anything like that. It's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7214)|
| 2:00:21| administrative. And this has been since 1976 and there's not been any changes at all. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| that's why we have asked for that. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| An ad hoc committee is what I'm asking for. Sheriff Spangler, I'm going to restate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| you just said just to make sure that everybody's hearing what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| What you're saying is to prepare maybe an ad hoc committee, maybe where you have a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| commissioners, some folks from the Merit Council and some folks from your team to sit down and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| take a look at everything. Is that what you'd like to do or would like to see happen in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| way, shape, or form? That's exactly it. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| And your preference would be to see that happen first and then bring this along with any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| changes to a vote. So, and once again, I'm going to take Commissioner Jay's words and say to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| of if we're going to pass multiple things to make things better to do them all maybe in one whack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| once we've had a chance to review and look at all of these. Is that sort of, am I hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| everybody and restating everything for everybody correctly? Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| Okay. Thank you. So, are there any other commissioners that have a question or need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| to make a clarifying statement on this? Okay. So, the motion that is on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| was a substitute motion to the original motion. Substitute motion was to defer this for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7303)|
| 2:01:50| which would have the ad hoc committee as described by Commissioner Spangler to have a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7310)|
| 2:01:58| meet prior to doing final passage on this item. That is the, I'm restating the motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| floor. Okay. Yes, Commissioner Smith. I just wanted to ask the sheriff what his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| objection is to what the law department has told us is codifying the system that's currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7332)|
| 2:02:20| This is Chief Mike Rubel, 400 Main Avenue, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7340)|
| 2:02:33| The problem with moving the physicals and the psychologicals to the after hiring changes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7353)|
| 2:02:40| entire dynamic of the testing itself. It becomes, instead of having a pre-employment test after a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7360)|
| 2:02:48| conditional offer of employment, it becomes a fitness for duty test and the entirety of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| we can test for and what we can ask and what we can do becomes different. We ask a person to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| in here and take a job with a sheriff's office, quit your current employment, turn down whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| applications that you have or other offers that you have, come to work for us, and then within 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| or 60 days, we give you a test and we may have to fire you because you don't meet our qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| It was a horrible system when we did it and we are trying to fix it. The concept of a conditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| offer of employment is the new way that HR works when you have physicals and when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| psychological tests. To do it this way turns us backwards and puts us in a position where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| going to be absolutely non-competitive. What we are trying to do is make sure that we fix the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| to make sure that the sheriff's office can be competitive. Yes. Okay. Thank you. I've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7417)|
| 2:03:45| couple of commissioners have some questions. Commissioner Biggs, then Anders. Yeah. Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| Rubble, why would we not do this when it was first reading two months ago instead of fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7429)|
| 2:03:57| quarter about the last moment? We asked that there be an ad hoc committee and that's what we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| was going to happen and then we end up with a passage on first reading and it kind of surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| us. This is not the professional way that HR hires anymore. That's just not the way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7447)|
| 2:04:16| Okay. Commissioner Biggs, follow up. All right. Commissioner Anders. Yeah. I went back and read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| the minutes from where the merit council voted on this and no one from the sheriff's administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| or the sheriff's office or anybody spoke against this. And I think everybody agrees you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| have a committee to relook at this. But this is the way, this is codifying practice and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| saving money and it changes nothing. It just... Nobody objected day one when the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7482)|
| 2:04:53| voted on it and they voted on it with no comment from anybody. It doesn't codify practice. Can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| explain something? It does not codify practice. This is not the way it's working now. What we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| done now is we've established the conditional offer of employment and then we give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| psychologicals and the physicals. I keep looking, y'all can't see me, but I keep looking to my HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| person and that is how the system is working now. What the merit system council is trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| is change the rules and take us backwards to where we hire, then we have a fitness for duty test. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| we have to fire somebody because they fail the fitness for duty test, we're walking right into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| an ADA challenge, Americans with Disabilities Act challenge. And we are asking somebody to come quit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7529)|
| 2:05:36| their original job, come to work for the sheriff's office, take a test in 30 or 60 days on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| opportunity to get fired. Y'all need to think about that. We are already at a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| disadvantage. If they fail the physical after we hire them, what's going to happen? They get fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| So what the system... And that's not the way the system works now, Commissioner Andrews. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| to tell you that that's not the way it works. We're giving conditional psychologicals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| conditional offer of employment, psychologicals and physicals. And then we make the offer becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7559)|
| 2:06:06| final if they pass. That's the way it works now. And they're trying to take us backwards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| way it was done in the 70s, which is why these rules need to be adopted. These rules were written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| in the 70s. This rule was adopted in 1990. And also, why would you give somebody employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7574)|
| 2:06:23| conditional offer of employment, when you don't know they're psychologically fit to serve as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| deputy or a corrections officer? You have to give them a conditional offer of employment under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| ADA before you can ask the questions that we have to ask. And Commissioner, I don't want to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| you. In 1990 is when the charter came into place and the original Merit System Council Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| was brought forward into your charter. These rules were passed in 1977,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| brought forward verbatim into your charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| The follow-up. Yeah, I could tell you, I remember when this came to first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| I know that there was some discussion that night about we need to kind of get this done at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| reading so that there could be some follow-up and some research. I'm thinking some folks looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| into it, maybe even hearing from the Sheriff on this. So, while it did pass quickly and seamlessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| at first reading, I do recall some of the brief discussion that evening was really to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| we do need to get the process moving. And this is something that most folks will be hearing from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| Merit Council and the Sheriff just over a few weeks after that before it came back. So, I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| remember if that was at, I recognize you, Commissioner Daley. But, and I honestly, I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| remember if that was at the work session or if that was at the Board of Commissioners meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| when that discussion took place. But I know something to that effect did take place when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| this was had for first reading. Go ahead, Commissioner Daley, and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The first reading we just passed because the Sheriff was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| I made the same suggestion two times before to have a committee. Last week, it was shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| Nobody wanted to do a committee. Last week, and all of a sudden, now we want to have an ad hoc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| committee. It's a, I agree with the ad hoc committee. We need, we need communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| and the communications between the Sheriff's Department and the Merit Council and County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| Commission. I think we can work this out. But I just don't understand why it's great today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| but last week it was. Mr. Chairman, if I may, this is Paula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| of the Director of the Merit Council. Yes, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Okay, thank you. What we are asking is not to do physicals and psychologicals after hire. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| will not be employed where they would have to be terminated. Yes, there was a time where we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| unfortunately, done the process that way. Once they are selected by the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| they are given a conditional offer of employment based on passing all of these exams, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| include a PT exam, the physical and the psychological. We already do certain testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| prior to that to be placed on the eligibility list. They would just have that conditional offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7742)|
| 2:09:10| up front, and then this would follow. The Sheriff's Office, I do not believe, if it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| cleared up this way, they would be doing the same process. They would make that offer and then do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| physical and psychological. It would not be a final offer until those were administered either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| way. Okay. Mr. Schoonmaker, was that a question? I saw you wave your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7766)|
| 2:09:36| You know, we're getting two different sides of the story here and we're supposed to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| a decision this evening. I mean, this is very interesting, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| Okay. Commissioner Jay? In just following up on Commissioner Schoonmaker's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7787)|
| 2:09:56| but that's an astute observation. And I think that's exactly why I'm asking for a pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| This is, we're talking about people's careers. We're talking about potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| legal issues with ADA. We're talking about a very complicated system that I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| most of us have a lot of knowledge on. And I do think it takes a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| to get it right and to make sure that we're on the same page. I agree. We've got two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7820)|
| 2:10:27| groups that are essentially saying the other person's not deciphering it right. But at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| end of the day, it's the Commission that has the responsibility of establishing these rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7832)|
| 2:10:38| establishing this Merit Council under resolution. And we should make sure that we take a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| of time and get it right and not just pass it for the sake of passing it to then readjust things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| later. And that's simply, that's exactly why I'm just asking for the pause. If we sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| and we can work things out and it's the same one, then fine, we pick up where we left off and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| you know, we move forward. But I think it's worth getting right for the sake of our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| sake of the team on the Merit Council and the administration and our Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. And as I recall, I know last week's work session did go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| very, very late. And I think there may have been some intentionality on the body, knowing that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| would come up for more deep discussion this week that may have been the intent of the body trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| to read the room. Although, anyway, that puts us there. Are there any other commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| have? Yeah, Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to make sure I've got this HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| question right in my head. Someone is selected, they are given a conditional offer subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7900)|
| 2:11:50| passing the physical and psychological test, correct? That is correct. Hi, this is Lucetta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| Villas. I'm the HR Director for the Knox County Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Street. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| correct. And I don't understand why anybody would quit their job until they've passed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| psychological and physical test. Because they have to be hired by us. Well, they would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| hired by us. So right now, the way it goes is we make a conditional offer of employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7932)|
| 2:12:20| and it's contingent upon them passing the PT test, physical, psychological, drug test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| background check. Once they pass all of that, then we move on to a written offer of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7946)|
| 2:12:35| So one would not be wise to quit their current job until they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| met the conditions of the conditional offer? That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| Okay, yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker. How many quit their jobs prior to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7965)|
| 2:12:56| officially installed as a Knox County Sheriff? They don't right now. But if we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7976)|
| 2:13:04| then that's what we're talking about. And let me just clarify, the terminology that's being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| in these two ordinances is very confusing. And as you can see, there's right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7990)|
| 2:13:17| two different ways of thought. So we're asking for this ad hoc committee so we can actually get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=7997)|
| 2:13:25| all the terminology correct and do this properly so we don't have to keep coming back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| And I'm happy to share examples. Example one, on page two, paragraph one, line two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8010)|
| 2:13:40| where it talks about a physical fitness test or exam, that is talking about the actual PT test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8020)|
| 2:13:48| that only corrections and law enforcement or patrol take. On page three, talks about a physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| examination. So again, the terminology is not correct. And we need to make sure that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| is accurately presented. Okay. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8043)|
| 2:14:11| Call for the question. All right, Commissioner Biggs calls for the question. When a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| is called, for those of you who may be watching, we actually have to vote first to actually vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| for the question to be called, which ends discussion. Then we move on to the actual vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| So all in favor of calling the questions, Madam Clerk, if you're voting yes, then you are voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8068)|
| 2:14:36| in agreement with Commissioner Biggs. You would like to see debate or questions cease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| and we'll proceed to voting on the resolution. If you're voting no, then you're saying you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| voting to continue questions or debate on this matter. Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| Okay. All right. Madam Clerk, roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| Commissioner Beeler. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| Commissioner Beeler votes aye. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8098)|

| 2:15:04| Commissioner Jay votes aye. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| Yes. Commissioner Biggs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Commissioner Gill. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Commissioner Gill votes aye. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| Aye. Commissioner Carringer votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| Commissioner Smith. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| Commissioner Smith votes aye. Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| Aye. Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| Aye. Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| Commissioner Bussler. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| Commissioner Bussler votes aye. All members present voting aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| Okay. The question has been called. We'll now proceed to the vote on the item that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| This is a substitute motion that was made by Commissioner Jay and seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| Nystrom. The substitute motion was to delay this by 60 days in order to have the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8143)|
| 2:15:54| reviewed and through establishment of a committee before any items are actually passed as I restated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8154)|
| 2:16:00| it earlier before the debate. That is what is before us. Madam Clerk, if you could please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| lead a roll call vote. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| Let me be clear. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| Yes. You're voting yes for the substitute motion, not the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| Commissioner Daly. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| I didn't understand you. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| Aye. Commissioner Daly votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| Commissioner Jay. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8183)|

| 2:17:02| Does anybody wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8222)|
| 2:17:11| Okay. Madam Clerk, could you announce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Four aye votes, seven no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| Okay. So, the substitute motion does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| The resolution that is now before us is the second reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| So, Madam Clerk, that's it. So, we will need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| that reverts back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| And Madam Clerk, if you could please state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| I cannot remember who made the original motion and second on the first one before the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| Commissioner Biggs made the motion, seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| Okay. So, that's back to the original motion made by Biggs and Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Commissioner, we're back to there if there's any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| Yes, Commissioner Smith, you just raised your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| I believe it's the law director helped write this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| And I was in consultation with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| I would like to hear their opinion upon the employment liability this may cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8285)|
| 2:18:13| and if the wording is sufficient for legal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8293)|
| 2:18:20| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| What we worked with was what the Merit Council wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| And we didn't set that policy, that was theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| And we tried to get it into verbiage that the Merit Council wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| So, that's what we did without any respect for the policy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8316)|
| 2:18:44| Now, the issue has been raised and properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| So, if you have this all reversed and turned around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| there's always in this day and time room for an ADA lawsuit or a civil rights lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8333)|
| 2:19:01| with regard to unfair hiring practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| Now, I can't give you the specifics of what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| I just say I think it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| There's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| Keep in mind that the Merit Council ordinance as it is now was passed as a public act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8353)|
| 2:19:22| or private act by the legislature back in 76 or 77, somewhere in there, maybe 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8362)|
| 2:19:30| There was nothing on the books with the legislature at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| So, that's how it came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| And then in 1990, the charter or the commission adopted that as an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8375)|
| 2:19:46| which you see there, 090 dash whatever that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| In 1990, it was adopted without any further consultation or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| Part of what I see with the dispute, if any, between the Merit Council and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8396)|
| 2:20:04| Sheriff is what is the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| You, commission sets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Commission can totally redraft the ordinance and the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| It can let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| It can modify it piecemeal like is before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| That's up to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| You have total and complete authority over how that board is created and its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8421)|
| 2:20:29| makeup and the rules under which it operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| Once you turn that over any item such as discipline that comes before the Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| you have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| But you have a control over the policy and the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| So, I'm not putting my imprimatur on this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| I think that it's what the Merit Council wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| And that's what we did in representing the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| Commissioner Jay, you got a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Chief Ruble, if you could, please try to explain in which way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8471)|
| 2:21:19| this policy is the policy you won't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| If you'll check section two of the ordinance, what I have in front of me as the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| section two, it's at the bottom of page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| You were told by the member of the Merit Council that we're not going to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| that there would be no reason for us to hire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| I want you to read the language they put in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| The sheriff shall appoint the person selected to the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| Appoint is legal jargon for hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| It doesn't mean select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| Appoint is you are hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| Now, read the rest of the sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| The sheriff shall thereupon appoint the person selected to the position where the vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8512)|
| 2:21:58| exists and shall notify the council of his action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| The Merit System Council will, within 30 days thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| have performed psychological and physical examinations on those persons selected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| You have made it a fitness for duty psychological and physical examination if you pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| That is a different set of tests than a conditional offer of employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| which is the way professional HR does it every single day in this country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| And I heard in the end, we had a little technical snafu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| I heard the end of what Law Director Book was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8549)|
| 2:22:33| I noticed he's saying that he's not talking about whether or not this is a good idea or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8556)|
| 2:22:36| This is what the Merit Council wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| I'm telling you this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| This is setting the county up for ADA lawsuits, like I mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| The Merit System Council may either, she either misrepresented to you what it did or she didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| understand that they are requiring us to hire these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| Thereafter, give them the physical and psychological exam that may terminate their employment with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8573)|
| 2:22:59| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8579)|
| 2:22:59| That's what this ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| That's what I've tried to get you to understand before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| So y'all just take a look at the language in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| The sheriff shall appoint thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| The council will do a psychological and physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| That's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| That is a legal and practical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| Commissioner Smith, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| I can't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| So if that, if this was amended and the word appointed was changed to select, would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8602)|
| 2:23:31| solve the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| We're back to trying to make changes within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| I don't know where the appropriate place would be for them to select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| It needs to go to a committee to make these changes all at once rather than piece it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| That was the motion we made and it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| But we have got a problem with this language and you are going to create a landmine for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| the sheriff's office to step on and the mayor council is not going to be the one that steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8635)|
| 2:23:55| We're the ones that are going to have to fire somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| They're going to sue us saying we gave them an improper psychological or physical test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| and we're going to spend a heck of a lot more $90,000 defending one of these ADA lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| That's my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| That's always been my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| I hate to be the technical guy up here arguing no, but this is a very technical legal argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| I don't know if Law Director Buch has looked into it or not, but this is a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| And forget about the legality for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Let's go back to what I said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| I can tell I was very unpersuasive with you all before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| But you're asking a man to quit his job, except a man or a woman, to quit their job, accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| an appointment with the sheriff's office on the opportunity to thereafter have to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| a test that's going to get them fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| Can I ask you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8682)|
| 2:24:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| Just please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| You don't have a problem with the process of you select your person, they get a conditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8686)|
| 2:24:55| employment and then they pass, have to pass their psychological and physical test, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| The phrase that you're, yes, the phrase you're looking for is a conditional offer of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| That's the way the sheriff's office operates right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8709)|
| 2:25:09| It's not an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| It is a conditional offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| You don't have a problem with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| So in other words, the biggest problem that you have with this is the way you think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| worded is going to lead to lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| The way that it is worded creates legal issues and very definite practical issues with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8726)|
| 2:25:32| to trying to hire somebody and then test them and fire them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| That's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| You got two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| The condition, if your question, Commissioner Smith, is do we agree with a conditional offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| of employment system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| The answer is yes, we've adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| We're good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| I don't know if it can fit there because the way they've pulled it out, they've pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| out Chapter 42, Section 4259, and I don't know if the conditional offer, they tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8753)|
| 2:26:01| I'm yelling, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| The conditional offer is, may not fit in that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8762)|
| 2:26:09| It's at 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| No case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8775)|
| 2:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8775)|
| 2:26:15| I'll take the microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| I tend to get loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8780)|
| 2:26:20| I think there was another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8782)|
| 2:26:22| I'll go Schoomaker, excuse me, John Larson had raised his hand earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| So I will go Commissioner Jay, then Schoomaker, then Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8787)|
| 2:26:32| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| Currently, as the Sheriff's Department is operating now, I just, we may have been repeating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| this, but I want to be really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| We say, officer, we would like for you to work for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| We give them a conditional offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| Then we test the four or five different tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| And then if the officer passes all of those tests to satisfaction, then they are hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8815)|
| 2:27:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8821)|
| 2:27:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| Tests and background, a very extensive background investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| Ms. Avila also wants to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8826)|
| 2:27:06| And is that, are you from the, a representative from the Merit Council, are you in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| that that is how it's currently being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| Just to clarify what you said, that they are given the conditional offer upon passing all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| of those exams, and then they're made the final offer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8846)|
| 2:27:26| So conditional offer, test, test, test, final offer, they're hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8851)|
| 2:27:31| That's how it works now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| The proposal that we have in front of us would change this to hiring them first, then test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8853)|
| 2:27:39| test, test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| And if they fail, that they might have to be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| Is everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| That is not how it's intended, but if that is how they're stating that it's legally written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| that is not how it was intended or how the Law Director's Office was supposed to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8880)|
| 2:28:00| That is not how the council noted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| Then to me, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| This is the clarification of exactly why I said, take a breath, take a pause, let's make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8885)|
| 2:28:12| sure this is right instead of just passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| So we've gone through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| We voted against taking a pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| I would really recommend everybody vote against this to stop and get it right and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| we do this instead of just doing it for the sake of the fact that it's on a second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| and we're trying to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| Because if it's not right and we get sued or if it's not in the right order, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| written wrong, this is a legal document that we now have to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8920)|
| 2:28:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8922)|
| 2:28:42| Thank you, Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| We've got Skidmaker, then Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I'm not in favor of supporting an ordinance if this could potentially lead to lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8928)|
| 2:28:56| that affect Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| If the paperwork is not right, we should not be voting this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| Let's wait until it is perfect before we pass an ordinance that affects Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| All right, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| Yeah, I agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| We should have waited, but that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| I want to make sure that the Merit System Council has their fair speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| You all have anything else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8974)|
| 2:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| Is there any other questions or clarifying comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| I mean, on this one, my concern is really, you know, are we, you know, is this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| I'll also say we've had a lot on our agenda the last month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| And this conversation that we've had should have taken last week or when I was at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8991)|
| 2:29:56| reading, maybe, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| It had to happen at least once before we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| So, I'm glad that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| I'm recognizing I see Commissioner Anders, then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| So, go ahead, Commissioner Anders first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| Yeah, I think this is an example where, I mean, this occurred through Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9012)|
| 2:30:20| over multiple meetings and nothing was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| We had a meeting last month and nothing was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| This is a terrible way to conduct business to make things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9026)|
| 2:30:32| If nobody said a word to any of the, you know, most of the commissioners haven't spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| anything other than what we've read and what we've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| And this shouldn't have got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| This should have been clarified and fixed months ago during, I mean, the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| The Sheriff has lawyers on duty, on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| The law department knew because they wrote it and nobody found the flaw in it until 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9053)|
| 2:30:58| minutes before the meeting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| I think it's a terrible way to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| And I think if the committee gets together and moves forward, it's got to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| Thanks, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| Yes, I voted for, against the last one because I wanted to get back to the discussion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9071)|
| 2:31:17| what was the flaw in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| And I do find it hard to fathom that with lawyers on both sides that somehow language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9079)|
| 2:31:27| has got through that could subject us to any future, to future lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| Yes, I am very disappointed to say, as Commissioner Anders said last month, when this went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9099)|
| 2:31:54| first reading, you know, we had workshop and we had a meeting and there were representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| there from the Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9120)|
| 2:32:01| In fact, the HR director was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| They never, ever came down, ever said anything, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| Also, last week, it was said about how anything was worded, the Merit Council and the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9129)|
| 2:32:21| of the Merit Council, I have 110% support of them that all they want to do is represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9141)|
| 2:32:32| the men and women who are our officers that are out there protecting us every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| That is who the Merit Council represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| They don't work for the Sheriff or the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| They represent the men and women that are out there as a backup because, and the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9163)|
| 2:32:50| this was all started was so that whenever Sheriff, whenever a new Sheriff came in or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| whenever administrations change and say they didn't get along with somebody's personality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| they couldn't just fire that man or woman that's out there wearing the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| The Merit Council backs up the men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| And now more than ever, these men and women out there need to know that they have a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9190)|
| 2:33:17| And I want to tell you, I ask because I'd heard the rumors that our Merit Council, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| may be trying to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| And those rumors have been circulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| And I've done a lot of door-to-door and I've asked some officers, the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9206)|
| 2:33:32| and all, what they thought about if there was the Merit Council getting rid of in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| And they're not for that because that is their backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9218)|
| 2:33:44| So, you know, no one has called or tried to get a hold of me if this was such a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9224)|
| 2:33:54| I don't understand it because I know the Merit Council, I know the people on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| have worked very hard and met to make sure it was being done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| And that it was saving Knox County taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| And so there's just something not right about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9246)|
| 2:34:12| And that's very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| And I hate to, you know, feel this way, but it's been put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9254)|
| 2:34:21| And so why this wasn't called and why it's just now being brought about, and it's a shame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| that we're having to do a Zoom meeting because I don't feel you get the input probably in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9267)|
| 2:34:35| the best way than when we're meeting there in the assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| So I don't know what's going on, but it just seems very strange to me that all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| this has popped up out of nowhere that we're being told this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9285)|
| 2:34:50| I feel like there was plenty of opportunities for this to have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| So I'm very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| And now I don't know, you know, it's kind of hard to know what to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| Mr. Law Director, there were another substitute motion that was different substantially from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| the original substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| Is that something that we could hear according to Roberts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| Yeah, you can make another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| Well, what I might propose is to make a substitute motion to defer this for one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| keep it as is, and encourage that committee to get together for at least their first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9320)|
| 2:35:26| Then the September Commission meeting, they can make the decision to act on this as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| or if they want to make any changes or, you know, approve it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9331)|
| 2:35:37| I think that would also, what I would direct the Sheriff's Department to do and Chief Rubel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9337)|
| 2:35:43| Sheriff Spangler, is to meet with each county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| We've got a new group coming in just to let them know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| I mean, if there's truly some concerns about this, that seems like something that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9350)|
| 2:35:58| Go ahead, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9358)|
| 2:35:58| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| So do we need to defer this for 30 days or can we just not put in the right verbiage there as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9360)|
| 2:36:08| the merit system thought they were getting put out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| I mean, is that not something we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Well, what I might, and I'll look to the lot up to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| and I'll look for clarification from Mr. Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| We got, if you made significant changes into the ordinance here at second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9384)|
| 2:36:30| if it changes it, then that sets it back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| So if you're going to do that, then you might as well, you know, put it off a month to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| have a little bit more time to intentionally study it, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| So, yes, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| You are correct, Mr. Chairman, that if there's any change at the substance of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| then that becomes a first reading, and then you have to have another second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| And what I hear saying is, in my opinion, without reading it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9416)|
| 2:37:03| but substituting that language is flipping that ordinance, and that would, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9423)|
| 2:37:09| verge right on being a substantive change, which would create, if you put that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| if somebody makes a motion to amend it that way, that would then create a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| and you'd go on to a second reading later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9439)|
| 2:37:24| Okay. I'll make a substitute motion from the Chair to postpone this for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| You know, keep the language as is, and I recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker with the second on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9451)|
| 2:37:38| So, that way, for the Mayoral Council, the language will stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| It will give them a chance at the next meeting to vote it in as is, but it will also give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| the Sheriff's Department's attorneys to convene with our new law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9467)|
| 2:37:54| as well as all the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| It sounds like everybody wants about the same thing, but there could be some words in this that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9476)|
| 2:38:01| need to be tweaked a little bit, and by, rather than voting it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| merely putting it off one month, that still gives the opportunity to do a complete second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| reading if this is deemed to be the way that we want it to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| So, that's my substitute motion, and Commissioner Schoonmaker, I recognize with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| Mr. Chairman, the Sheriff's Department, may I say something real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| Yeah, go ahead. You'll recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| I just want to clarify, as I said earlier, there is no way, and let me repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| no way that I would want to do away with the Mayoral Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| So, however that rumor got started, I don't know, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9513)|
| 2:38:38| But what really bothered me is the fact that all we're trying to do is change an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| administrative issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| It has nothing to do, because I'm the first one to support making sure we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| the Mayoral Council for the protection of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| It is there for the employees to keep me and any other sheriff from doing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9532)|
| 2:38:57| arbitrarily to those individuals, and I think that's important to make sure that stays in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9542)|
| 2:39:02| So, with that being said, I will shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| There is a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| Is there any other questions or clarifications on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9550)|
| 2:39:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9554)|
| 2:39:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9555)|
| 2:39:15| Madam, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9555)|
| 2:39:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| I recognize Smith and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| Randy, you raised your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| It seems to me everybody's in agreement where we want to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| It's a matter of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| I do believe that there needs to be this committee formed to look at other areas of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9572)|
| 2:39:40| Merit Council policy that might be, I guess the word would be, antiquated and out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| But I don't think we should tie this one issue to the other changes that need to happen or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| that need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| If we form an ad hoc committee, which I'm in favor of, that could take months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9596)|
| 2:40:03| Is this something that we need to get in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| Would a better motion maybe be to have the Merit Council, the Sheriff's Department, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| the Law Department sit down and get this language right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| Because it seems like we're all trying to go the same place with this particular change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| Let me, as the maker of the motion, I'll restate with that what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| So, the gist of my motion was to defer it for one month with the reference to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9625)|
| 2:40:32| I can amend my substitute motion to say defer for one month with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9632)|
| 2:40:41| being specific that before the work session, the Merit Council, Law Department, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9641)|
| 2:40:50| HR legal counsel for the Sheriff's Department will sit to meet and go over the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| Does that capture the gist of what you're saying there, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9655)|
| 2:41:00| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| And then I think we form a committee to look at the other parts of the policy that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| need to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| So, I want to restate my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| If it's okay with the second, my substitute motion will be to defer this for one month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| where no language will be changed in this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| The intent of the motion will be, though, to have the Merit Council, the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| Law Director, and the Sheriff's Department to come together for one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| The meeting will be publicly noticed, so members of commission will be invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| And we will go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| Is that clear, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| You had the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| The second concurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9708)|
| 2:41:48| I think that's about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure that in your motion that the three sit down, the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9710)|
| 2:41:56| entities sit down and come back to us with language that does achieve what it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| everybody is trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| So amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9726)|
| 2:42:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9727)|
| 2:42:07| And Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| Do you not see the hands raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| Apologies, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9736)|
| 2:42:16| Yes, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| You made a statement about your motion that said you would sit down and work with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9738)|
| 2:42:24| people on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| We may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| After this meeting, you will not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| You won't be the one that will be handling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| So we need to get back to where we get what we need here for the Sheriff and the way he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9755)|
| 2:42:44| hires and make sure the Merit Council gives it to us, gives their side of it, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| I would like to make a substitute motion that we have no action on this item until we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9773)|
| 2:43:00| the ad hoc committee and all we need to get back to us to where we can vote on it as one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9780)|
| 2:43:07| like the Sheriff says, get it all together at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| And that's what he was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| So if you're going to make a motion, just make a motion that we set a committee up until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9793)|
| 2:43:20| we get this thing done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| You can't have a substitute motion on top of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| Oh, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Mr. Law Director, could you please clarify the double substitution question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| Commissioner Andrews is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| You've got to vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| You can't have a substitute on a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9823)|
| 2:43:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| The substitute motion that is before us, we've stated it clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| And to be clear, I'm not going to be the one convening it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9832)|
| 2:43:52| Back to you, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| Did we make enough difference in this motion to be different from the motion that's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9836)|
| 2:44:03| the agenda or this substitute motion away from what we had before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| One month, two months, or 60 days down to one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9848)|
| 2:44:13| It's not substantial enough as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| I don't think, Mr. Law Director, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9857)|
| 2:44:22| I'm not sure I understand the question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| Say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| The question is, to make the motion that we had to go back to close to what Mr. J wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9866)|
| 2:44:35| it has to be substantially changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| Changing it by just 30 days, does that make it substantial enough to where you can re-enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| that by Robert's Rules of Order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| You're talking about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| Procedurally, the substantive change is a change in wording which changes the substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9888)|
| 2:44:54| of the ordinance, not the procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9894)|
| 2:44:59| Go 30 days is not a change of the substance of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| Does that answer your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| I think what Commissioner Bussard, if I might restate, his question was, we had a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| motion that was a, can you bring to, it's almost like it's almost a zoning question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| where you can't bring something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| And was a motion that was brought forward with a difference of 30 days and it was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| different than the motion that did not pass earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| As chair, it's my ruling that it is because it's a difference of a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9926)|
| 2:45:33| And if a vote needs to take place to challenge my ruling, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| But I would like to bring this motion forward, which is simply to not make a change to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9939)|
| 2:45:46| right now, to have a one-month delay, and to have the three entities have one meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| to begin to bring us their recommendation, starting probably next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| And that is the motion that is currently before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| All right, that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Madam Clerk, would you please begin a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9969)|
| 2:46:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9973)|
| 2:46:20| Can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| Commissioner Jay votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| Can you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| The motion is to defer this for one month to the September agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| With no changes to the wording in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| The only reason for deferral is a direction to the Merit Council, the law director, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=9996)|
| 2:46:43| the Sheriff's Council slash HR to come together for one meeting to review the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10003)|
| 2:46:50| If they find a better version of language, then they can bring that recommended on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| specific item to us at the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| That would allow us to get this closed to move forward and then allow that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| to be formed by the next body to take a longer term look at any things that might need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10022)|
| 2:47:07| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| Will that be the second reading or will we have to revert back to the first reading and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| go through this process again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| If they make a recommendation for sizable changes, then you have to go back to first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10040)|

| 2:47:24| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10044)|

| 2:47:28| Commissioner Gill votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10048)|

| 2:48:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10111)|

| 2:49:19| Missing two commissioners, Commissioner Geale and Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10159)|
| 2:49:24| Commissioner Baylor had shared with me he needed to get some rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| So, he, I think the work he put in that kind of wore him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| So, he's going to take a, he's, won't be joining back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| So, let's all keep him in our thoughts and prayers and wish him a quick recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10173)|
| 2:49:39| So, as we get back into the meeting, as I said, this is the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10179)|
| 2:49:46| You call the roll and we have our first item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| So, Madam Clerk, we have, I believe it's item 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| Would you please go ahead and open that item up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10195)|
| 2:50:03| Okay. Item 69 is 7-A-20-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10203)|
| 2:50:09| It's a request of Scott Williams and Associates for South County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10209)|
| 2:50:14| from AG Agricultural to RR Rural Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10214)|
| 2:50:18| The property is located at 0 Bays Mountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| Parcel ID 126-13803 in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10220)|
| 2:50:27| All right. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| Before I go to the Planning Commission, I want to verify, is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| All right. Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| Present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10238)|
| 2:50:42| Okay. I'll go first to Miss Brooks at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| Good evening. This is Amy Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10245)|
| 2:50:53| The Knox County Planning Commission did recommend that County Commission adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10253)|
| 2:50:58| Resolution 7-A-20-SP amending the South County Sector Plan to Rural Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10258)|
| 2:51:04| because of changing conditions in the Area Warranty Amendment of the Laney's Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10264)|
| 2:51:11| And this was a vote of 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| Okay. 8-6 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| And the Chair will look to the applicant briefly to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| like to make a quick statement on exactly what you're planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| Yes. Can you still hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| Okay. I would like to get this land rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10287)|
| 2:51:33| It's a small parcel and we'd originally asked for three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10293)|
| 2:51:38| The difference between two and three units on this particular parcel would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| the difference between six and nine homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| As you guys probably know, it's very difficult on these smaller parcels to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| develop anything and be able to turn it over with the infrastructure required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| without having a decent amount of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| And as you know, three units per acre is kind of consistent with most development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| single family development that goes on in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| This little area used to not have sewer, so we're kind of a first to end on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10324)|
| 2:52:08| Knox Chapman has just run a sewer line in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10328)|
| 2:52:11| And so we would respectfully like to request that we get bumped up to three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| so we could do a total of nine homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| That would be the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| We may only be able to get eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| Once we do engineering, there may be a detention pond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| would take up space on one of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| So you may just be approving two additional on top of what Planning Commission allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| And that would be our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10355)|
| 2:52:35| And by the way, that will be in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| You've got two motions that we'll be hearing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| One is about a change to the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10359)|
| 2:52:41| and then the second will be about the zoning specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| So the first one that we're working on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| is more specific to the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| which doesn't drill down that deep in the actual density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| I guess the chair will look to Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| or any of the commissioners if they've got any questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| Wrote it all down so I could get it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| So bear with me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| The Gap Creek area has changed since the last sector plan in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10386)|
| 2:53:12| Our last sector plan, of course, like I said, was in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10392)|
| 2:53:16| The sector plan, the south sector plan is three years overdue from an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10396)|
| 2:53:21| Since 2020, some of the following conditions have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| Johnson University has invested over $25 million in improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| including a new sports complex and a recreation area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| for the students and the community to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| Enrollment for incoming freshmen has increased yearly for the past four classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10416)|
| 2:53:42| Johnson University and Knox Chapman have installed a new six-inch sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10422)|
| 2:53:46| that runs from the university on Kimberlin Heights and Henry's Chapel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| all the way to Chapman Highway, which is a distance of seven miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10430)|
| 2:53:55| This new line runs in front of the property being asked to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| At the same time, the water line was upgraded from an eight-inch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| to a 16-inch line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| Johnson University has purchased the old Kimberlin Heights community park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| and has applied for a $750,000 Blue Cross Healthy Community Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10450)|
| 2:54:15| that will include a playground, picnic pavilion, walking track, and other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10455)|
| 2:54:21| This property is directly across the street from the requested rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| Also, Seymour Volunteer Fire Department Station Number 6 was opened in November 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| with the help of Knox County and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| In 2017, a new lifestyle and emergency helipad was constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| with upgrades to Station 6 has also been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| That was in 2020 and 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| More importantly, in 2015, the Dollar General property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| was in the 2012 Sector Plan as AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10492)|
| 2:54:57| The property was rezoned with a 2012 Sector Plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| from AG to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| This was a jump from AG all the way to commercial in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| That was a big...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| And we approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| Planning approved it and County Commission approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| from AG to see commercial for the new Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| which they really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| It's been a great asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| A couple years ago, our roads department put a brand new bridge over Gap Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| which made the speeding a whole lot faster across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| A new lot of water line replacement was also along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| Kimberlin Heights Road at Porterfield Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| With all the new developments, utilities and community park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| the next updated Sector Plan should show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| as Kimberlin Heights Road as a rural growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| and should suggest up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| With a Sector Plan from 2012 that has not been updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| and overdue by three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| with the new investments of Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| utility upgrades, Johnson University growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| investment prior to 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| I will be making a motion to adopt the Sector Plan change amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10562)|
| 2:56:06| from AG to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| because of the changing heat conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| Then I will also be recommending density up to three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=10572)|
