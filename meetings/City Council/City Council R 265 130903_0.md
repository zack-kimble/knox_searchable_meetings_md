| 0:02:05| I have several that would like to postpone, starting with 12C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| That's the Rufus Smith development on Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| They're asking that this be postponed for eight weeks until October 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| They're looking at additional properties that may be a part of the complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| and so they're working their redesign on that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| We want to go ahead and vote on that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| There's a motion and a second to postpone 12C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=163)|

| 0:02:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Those are postponed to October 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Then we'd like to postpone 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Can you speak down into your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| We'd like to postpone 12F, G, and H for four weeks until October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| This is the North Shore Town Center project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Once again, the developer and the neighbors would like to continue dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| and get together and discuss potential development of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| so we'd offer that for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=201)|

| 0:03:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| So 12F, G, and H are postponed to October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| And then we'd like to postpone 12R, M&M Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| This is the corner of Westland and Morrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| Once again, the developer is planning to meet with the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| and discuss further the potential development of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| So I propose that we postpone 12R until October 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| This is 12R postponement to October 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Any other postponements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| We have 11A to B are renewals for certificates of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and 12V to 12AC are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=264)|

| 0:04:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| The ayes have it, and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| For the Mayor's Report, I want to announce that tomorrow, Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| at 6 p.m., we will hear public comments for the realignment of the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| to Fort Dickerson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| We're trying to give a better entrance there so people can get in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| and we're lining it up with Woodlawn Pike and the traffic light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| The meeting will be held at the Flinnegan Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| which is the old Flinnegan School, at 115 Flinnegan Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| Again, that's at 6 o'clock tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| and we will present the project plans and some of our renderings at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| meeting, and we encourage the public to come out and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| Also today, streetscape construction started for the 500 block of North Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=313)|
| 0:05:22| So watch out for construction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| That's the 500 block runs from I-40 overpass on Gay Street up to Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| And the major goals of this project are to improve the streetscape with landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| define the on-street parking, address stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| and improve sidewalks throughout the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| And this is expected to take about four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| At times, traffic will be restricted to one lane during construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| but entrances to businesses will be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| So as you all know, this is kind of the last linkage of all those different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| streetscape improvements that we've made along Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| So we're glad to see that that has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| And finally, the city of Knoxville and Knox County will hold a joint 9-11 memorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| service to honor those who lost their lives during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| The 12th anniversary observance will be held at 8.35 a.m. here on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| September 11, in front of the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| This ceremony will be led by the Knoxville Police Department and the Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| and the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| So we invite all of you to come with us for this memorial service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| And that is the completion of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| I'd just like to report on a wonderful thing that happened in South Knoxville last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| a couple of wonderful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| But actually, the Pat Woods family, Pat was a prominent business person here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| I'm sure most folks are familiar with Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| And his family donated 100 acres of very pristine land off of Taylor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| It goes perfectly hand-in-hand with our urban wilderness and connects some further parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| And it's on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| It's Pappy's Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| So before long here, you'll be able to traverse and trek that 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| in addition to the 1,000 acres that we already have preserved with the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| So that was a tremendous gift to the city of Knoxville, the residents of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=452)|

| 0:14:10| I just wanted to ask Becky a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| It looks like Becky, assuming the microphone works over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| it looks like we went from a federal funding approach to out of our own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| Could you just explain where we are on that and how that came about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| You need to hire a repairman for that microphone, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| This program was initially funded with private dollars when it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| It was picked up with the HPRP money when that came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| That was ARRA-funded money that was part of the stimulus package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| and so we were able to fund it for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| With the HPRP funds following that, we had some federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| We used CDBG to fund it for a year, and then the city picked it up last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| because of our funds being decreased annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Once again, the city is putting in $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| KCDC is putting in $62,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| and they will have four case managers that will be in charge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| They will have four case managers in the high rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| And KCDC is actually raising some of that funding privately, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| I believe Alvin's here can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| While he's walking up, is that sort of the future of this program, Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| in terms of federal funding probably not being available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| It's more likely to be our back pocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| More likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| We would certainly love to have the federal dollars to be able to fund this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| It prevents people from being evicted to the street, and it has some wonderful results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| And CAC does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Councilman Dev Volpe, Alvin Nance with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Last year we raised $62,500 privately to support this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| and we're positioned to do that again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| We're committed to raise another $62,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Y'all will recall we talked about this during budget hearings that the city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| This is part of our commitment to addressing homelessness and preventing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Okay, so we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| I will just address then Councilman Saunders' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Several months ago we pulled together the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| and got buy-in from a lot of the different stakeholders in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| We drafted, we sort of developed an outline for what we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| the direction we wanted to move to develop a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Then for the next several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Mike Dunthorne basically facilitated a series of meetings with the different subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| They now have a draft plan that is sitting on my desk that I am having a meeting with Becky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| and Michael and I think Bill Lyons with tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| So we will take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| And if we think it's in the version then to, you know, put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| then we will release that plan and start moving forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| But it's so we're close to having a plan ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Well, we'll call the stakeholders back actually before anything is released because they need to see the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| in its totality, which will still be a draft, and then they will see it and then we'll work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| But we're close to having another public meeting or stakeholder meeting, which is public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an amendment to the agreement with Humana Insurance Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| updating the average wholesale discount list and the list of specialty pharmacy medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| provided by our Pharmacy Benefit Manager for City's self-funded medical program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| as well as setting forth the additional administrative services Humana provides as the plan's fiduciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Councilman Dallivaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I don't know if Christine Fitzgerald is here, but I guess someone is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| This particular information sheet has one of my favorite sentences in the whole 733-page package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| It says, According to the City's contracted pharmacy plan auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| the updated specialty drug list that this is talking about could provide the City with approximately $150,000 in savings in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| Do you want to talk or tout about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| That sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| We're paying Humana a little bit more to administer, but this updated list could help us save taxpayer dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| That's actually the same amount that they had promised that they would save us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| We wanted to make sure when Humana, with specialty drug lists, it's always changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| Drugs fall off the list and new drugs come on, and so we wanted to adjust the list accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| So when we went to the table with Humana to talk about this, we didn't want it just to benefit Humana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| We wanted it to benefit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| So we came to an agreement with the list that would produce what we were supposed to get for 2013 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| So we're not changing the list for 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| We're only changing it for 2014, and we hope that we'll get the same amount that we would get for 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Just to follow up on that, it's a really small number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I just wondered why they're charging you $5,000 more when they're going to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| So there are three pieces to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| The first one is the planned fiduciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| We actually agreed for Humana to be the claim fiduciary in the beginning, but we never put it in our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| So essentially there's a new case document that we go over in implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| and in that new case document it was determined that we really needed them to be the claim fiduciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| We are not clinical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| We don't want to be the last and final word for somebody's prescription drug needs, so we really wanted Humana to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| It's $0.25 for them to do it per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| It's actually $4,500 roughly, but we went conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| So with that said, we needed to address it formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| So that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you, Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1226)|

| 0:22:02| and safety inspection program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I wonder if the Deputy Chief would just tell us a tad about how we do this and how we go about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| We obviously have a lot of trucks on I-40 and I-75 and 640,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| so tell us what you're going to be doing in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Currently we have about three officers that are assigned as a commercial vehicle enforcement unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| that works on this consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| What we do is look at our statistics, our crash data, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| and we try to place them in the areas that we see the most causation factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| or the most prevalent issues with the commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| For the higher risk areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Now, what this money will do is allow us to pay overtime to additional officers as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| to increase that enforcement with the idea that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| we're making the streets safer for everybody that's on them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| and it's focused on our interstates and our state routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| I know, like, for example, when you're coming down from Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and you see that one turn that goes to downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| about once a month there's always a truck laying on its side or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| They really don't believe the sign that says 25 miles an hour or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and they tip over and jackknife and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So do these officers, do they have their physical presence help people slow down and read the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| or do they stop them and counsel them, or what do they do on these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| Of course, they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| They're conducting traffic enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Normally, if they stop somebody, they receive a citation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| But hopefully the visual presence helps as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| So it's kind of the physical presence thing that really helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1433)|

| 0:25:21| It looks like we want some discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1521)|

| 0:25:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Tom Anderson is here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Do we hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1534)|

| 0:25:39| timer for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Tom Anderson, 2712 Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Appreciate the council members and the mayor for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| I'm here as a member of the Knoxville City community, the campus community as an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| or employee at the University of Tennessee with some very deep concerns regarding these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| closures, all of the closures at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| As I'm sure all of you know, more than just the campus community are affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| The city as a whole uses the campus and the campus area for whether it's for events or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| games or classes or public forums or whatever that goes on at the various different buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| As I'm sure all of you are aware, the planners with the university and the planners among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| the city have not always seen eye to eye on plans as far as access and street closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| And through healthy discussion with the city, we've always managed to come to an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| that is best served for both the city and the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| And if you exercise this closure and grant the university, you essentially grant the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| university complete control of all of these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| And while they will tell you that they will be more than happy to consider your thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| in reality that's all they have to do is consider them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| And their final decision will be in the best interest of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| And while they may consider your thoughts, that's the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| So the discussion will change between what the city commission and the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| has the ability right now to say no, that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| If you exercise these closures, that ability goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Additionally to this, maintenance issues will now fall on the university as far as maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1650)|
| 0:27:40| the streets, the drainage, and all of those sundry things that go underneath the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| that are a part of road maintenance that many people don't really notice until you drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| through potholes or have road closures and access issues, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| And the university is a great university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| I love working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| I plan to retire from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| But their record with maintenance is not sterling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Now there are many reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Some of it is state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| But ultimately the responsibility rests with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| If anyone goes to the hill and tours a number of the buildings on the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Dougherty has been under renovation for years, five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and it still looks like a new construction zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| There are many buildings on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| They're fine historic buildings that are in terrible condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| And the reason is because for many decades there has been no real deferred maintenance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| They have not dedicated money to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Now that recently has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| So that's starting to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| But you have to ask yourself, is that going to continue to improve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| At what point do they decide that deferred maintenance on this back street that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| not that many people use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| You know, we'd rather use this money for an athletic building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| or we've gotten some money for this other building and we have to put some money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| Some of those decisions are questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Dougherty, roof leaks on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| A couple years ago there was a very bad hailstorm, I'm sure we all remember it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| that created a whole lot of leaks in buildings on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| As a result of that, the campus and the university did an aerial survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| an infrared aerial survey to identify where all of the roof leak issues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| And they identified not only the ones that they knew of in the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| and the areas that they leaked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| but they identified a great many in addition that they didn't know were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Some of those were made worse by the hailstorm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| but many of those problems were there because of the deferred maintenance issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| because the university and the state had not dedicated specific money to maintain those roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| And had they done that, those leaks would not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Forty-five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| ADA compliance is another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Not very long ago the university completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| or should be close to completing ADA compliance issues with many buildings, older and newer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| which is a commendable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I'm glad they're finally doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| The question I have is why did it take them so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| and why were there so many buildings so far out of compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| All of these questions I think are deep concerns when we're talking about city streets that everyone uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| not just university campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Long-term plans include eliminating all street parking on Volunteer Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| I've worked as a cab driver for games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| I've worked parking for games, and I park on there every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| and I don't have to tell anyone here I don't think what kind of parking issues that could create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| Now, maybe they have a plan for that and maybe they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| I'm sure somewhere in their long-term plan there is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| But all of those are deep questions that I hope you all will take into serious consideration when you vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| and I strongly urge you to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Okay, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| I want to commend the gentleman that just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I think he brought up a lot of good points that some of us are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| On the one hand, I think it's great that the city can turn over the maintenance and this sort of thing of particular streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1879)|
| 0:31:28| but I also think that I know in the last couple of days I know I personally have gotten some e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| and some information regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| and what I'd like to do is to see us maybe postpone this until we can really get more detailed information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| on exactly what the university has in mind in terms of keeping up the maintenance of these streets and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| So I'd like to listen to the rest of my colleagues talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and see if they have some of the same concerns that I do in terms of what are the future plans of these streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| and what does it mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I know the university, just as the gentleman was saying, is interested in what their overall master plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| and I think that maybe we on council should understand what that master plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| and also understand what it does mean by closing these streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| and I think that if we could have some time where we spent as council with the university and their planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| maybe we would have a better idea of what they have in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| instead of us just automatically closing the streets on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| So I'd like to hear what my colleagues have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Mr. Maples is here as well from UT, I think, if you want to ask him any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Councilman Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| It might be good if we could hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| I mean, through about 200 pages of material on these nine different roads they're closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| it's basically the southern quadrant along Nayland Drive and behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| There's nothing that says why this should be done, and I think that's an important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| I don't know whether the public will eventually be excluded from using some of these roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| or whether it's simply a function of their ongoing construction with the student union and the arenas and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| but I think it would be really helpful to hear why they want to take full control of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| As Councilman Grieve said, it's nice to avoid the maintenance costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| but it certainly looks like access might be severely affected at some point along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| and we'd like to know what they're doing and why, and maybe that's great for both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| But we haven't seen it yet, and it's not in the materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| so I'd welcome him to come up and speak to us if he'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Mr. Maples, please state your name and address, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Jeff Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I'm representing the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And let me just quickly address, these are plans that we have given quite a bit of thought to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| but let me quickly point out what we're requesting tonight is not setting a new precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| We have before come before this body and requested the transfer of streets from the city to the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| and it's done so basically for lots of different reasons, and I can get into that here shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| but, again, that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We own approximately over half the streets already, and that creates lots of times some confusion when we have visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| people asking, am I owning a university street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Am I owning a city street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I mean, so what we're trying to do is bring some consistency to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| If you'll notice the streets that we've requested, they're all within the main core of the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| which we feel does not hinder any other of the neighboring Fort Sanders or other areas adjacent to the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2080)|
| 0:34:49| They're all really south of Terrace down to Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| So this really helps us as we continue to develop our master plan, as Dwayne Grieve mentioned a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| because oftentimes as we propose a project or build a new building, it is adjacent to a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| What often happens then, we have to get involved the city to approve landscaping because it involves the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| and oftentimes we can build a building and have a landscaping plan that includes lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| and then we get to the sidewalk, we have to get city approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Not that it's not possible to do, but it creates a delay, and then sometimes we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| We may have one city standard, a university standard lot, and then we have a city standard lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| and it does not really provide the aesthetics we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| In addition, what this does as well is provides what we're trying to do is promote a more pedestrian-friendly campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| And I can assure you from the question brought forth, we are not trying to restrict access to the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| What we're trying to do is look at those areas in which are heavily traveled by our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| and try to promote that more pedestrian-friendly campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Will there possibly be some roads that we would close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| But there would be ones now which are really more pedestrian than vehicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Most of the streets you're looking at, though, will still remain open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| But again, for us, as we continue to try to beautify the campus and provide those type of aesthetics that we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2181)|
| 0:36:30| it helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| You talked about maintenance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| I know the city, oftentimes we get requests from our students to improve a sidewalk where a sidewalk is buckling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| or there's a pothole in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| We can't make those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| We have to call and ask the city to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| And we get great cooperation from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| But we all realize the city has a lot wider scope of areas in the neighborhoods to cover rather than the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| There are streets we can quickly adapt or make those improvements to sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| which we oftentimes get requests due to liability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| So, again, it's another case of us trying to react more quickly to maintenance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Mr. Anderson brought up the fact of the past deferred maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Let me address very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| We've had our problems in the past, but I believe those are behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| We're putting more emphasis on maintenance on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| We can't realize or try to dwell on the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| What we need to look for is the future of what we can do to make the campus a better place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| both from a pedestrian-friendly but also more from a static campus beautification standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| And that's what we're trying to strive for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I'm willing to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| I appreciate that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| So, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Well, we had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| We were here last year, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| We closed a couple of streets last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| T. Martin, Phillip-Fulmer Way, and Peyton Manning Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| And there were concerns then about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and there were concerns then about whether those were going to be left open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| and we were assured that they were, and I guess they still are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| And you said tonight that some of these, even though I didn't see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| it's not in there which ones you were thinking about closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| I mean, I guess I would go back to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I mean, one of the reasons last year was given that it really benefited in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| Do you all see this as a benefit or giving them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| be able to close these roads and make them UT property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| And, you know, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| You know, from our perspective, once they become their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| then they are primarily responsible for safety, security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| law enforcement through the University of Tennessee Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| We obviously have an MOU with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| We work closely with them on all of their big events that they have with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| And then through the memorandum of understanding with other crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| and that sort of thing, we wouldn't essentially, I guess, abandon the area, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| but they would have the primary responsibility for law enforcement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| and then we would assist them as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Do you all have good communication now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| When they close a road for their own special event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| to be able to get fire trucks in there or get emergency vehicles in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Do you all have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| You know, do you have those alternate routes planned out in those cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Do you have that kind of open communication with UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| We do with their police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| We work with them well and frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| I can't speak for the fire department there specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| but from the police department perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| we're talking almost on a daily basis, at least weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| Captain Jones and their Deputy Chief Seavers over their patrol division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| their officers out there, are frequently talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| A good example of that would be the Fort Sanders community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| and some of the meetings that we have with the community there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and with the police departments and the way we interact with safety surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and events up in the Fort area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| So you don't see closing these roads would be hindering you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| or the fire department in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I'm just predisposed to giving away real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| I mean, that's, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I mean, have we seen a benefit of closing those roads last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I mean, has that been a benefit to you all, KPD and fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Has that been a benefit to closing those roads last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| You say yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I would say from a call volume or a call perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| we haven't seen any real benefit either way, negative or positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| He mentioned sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Does that include the sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| So are the sidewalks then go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and the responsibility for the maintenance of sidewalks goes with the road too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| I could go on, but anyway, I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Yeah, let me, I'd like to maybe in terms of some of the benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| or how we see it, call on Dr. Lyons to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| because we've had an ongoing relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| If that's okay with counsel to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Yes, we see this as overall being in the city's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I mean, it's for reasons of not having to respond to all the calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| the smaller calls that the chief identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| and having UT police right there to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| and provide consistency across the various, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| areas where they control the streets and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Can't really see any downside whatsoever that will put the maintenance of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| and the streets and responsibility in the hands of the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| allow them to obtain consistency and retain consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| So I think all those internal to the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| we see a benefit of being absolved of the cost, the responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| and really no downside to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| And as Jeff pointed out, you know, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| And we've worked very closely with the university on lots of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| including into Fort Sanders, the installation of lights for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| I think we have a very positive relationship with the university so that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| not just students, but everybody involved would make sure they're in better shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| than they were before by making these arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| I think the aesthetic concerns and the lighting and such are very real things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| We have certain stocks of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| When the lights go in, we have to pay for them and draw from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| And if you've been on campus much lately, there's been a massive amount of aesthetic improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| and there is consistency within the university that's not necessarily the same as with our fixtures and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| So I guess we would say that I don't see any downside to this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I see an upside of providing consistency in the campus area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and an upside of working with the university to let them realize their goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| of having a more beautiful campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| One last thing I would say, we've worked closely with UT in the whole Cumberland Avenue project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| in making the entire area pedestrian-friendly and much more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| That's a core to the Cumberland project and the increased sidewalks and walkability there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| And this we see as extending into the campus because they're also, I'll let Jeff speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| but they're on a great parallel movement toward more walkability on campus too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2592)|
| 0:43:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I'm extremely disappointed that we have this many streets that we are being asked to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| We really had no information from the university until tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| So in a matter of eight or ten minutes, we're supposed to really decide one way or the other what to do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| We also know that with the closing of the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| that there could certainly be a denial of access by the university down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| I've had several calls today, and I've spoken to a group at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| and there wasn't any support for the university doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| because there's not a great deal of trust about what the university will do down the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| We had reference to the fact that deferred maintenance on the campus is an ongoing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| You say very convincingly that that's in the past and we need to look ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| At the same time, I think we need to keep an eye on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| because we've heard before that this will happen, that will happen, and it doesn't always happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| I think it would probably be a benefit to council if we were a little more aware of the master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| because that does impact the city, and we hear about the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| It's come up with some other issues that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| but I don't recall that we have had any real in-depth or serious discussions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| So I would agree to a postponement so that we can look at this a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| If I have to vote tonight, I will vote against this, closing of all these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Yes, I guess I'll ask my question of Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Other than not having to have maintenance, would there be any other tangible benefits to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| if we turn these streets over to UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Well, we would be somewhat less exposed on the liability front to some things by giving up the maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| That would be a related benefit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Otherwise, I think, you know, given where these streets are and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| I don't see really any benefit or cost in terms of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| I mean, I think that general citizens other than students would have all the access to the campus continuing from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| I'll let Jeff speak more to that if he would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| But I think the main benefit we get is avoiding the cost, the upkeep, the sidewalk, the street repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2757)|
| 0:46:07| the attention paid by our folks to minor things that happen on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Those would be the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I mean, I think you make a good point in that we've, you know, we've given roads up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| But this is a huge block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| I don't know of a time that we've been faced with this many roads at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| Maybe we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Maybe we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I don't remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| And I've been supportive of, you know, everything that the university does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| You're a tremendous asset to the city of Knoxville, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| And I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| And though these may not be directly affecting neighborhoods, there is a lot of concern in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| And that's, you know, the vast majority of that is the 1st District, which I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| So I think you can understand tonight if there was a vote, I don't think that it would be favorable from the comments that I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| So I'll either make one or I'll be supportive of a postponement so we can, you know, work through this, get a little bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2818)|
| 0:47:08| I would like to see some neighborhood involvement, people, a lot of different stakeholders around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| Perhaps a workshop probably would be the best venue for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| But I think with this big a block, I think we need to slow down a little bit and gather more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Councilman Della Voti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Yeah, just since Jeff is at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| I guess just to add what was said, there's a difference to me in some of these side streets like the Johnny Majors, the Shemeika Holes Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2854)|
| 0:47:45| But when you get down to closing Lake Loudoun Boulevard and Volunteer Boulevard or sections of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| there's a nice question of will the public be invited to drive through those or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| I don't know if there's any condition being put on that they would stay open to public access or not on those major roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| that are roads people use when they're coming from Cumberland down or just visiting the campus for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| Let me point something out very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| First off, Volunteer Boulevard is not one of the ones included in there tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| We're not asking for Volunteer Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Let me just say we have Lake Loudoun Boulevard, yes, but not Volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| But let me very quickly say I keep hearing this restricting access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| We would be absolutely foolish to be restricting public access to a public university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| That is totally false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| We would not be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| We're not accusing you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| We're just concerned that that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Let me reassure you right now that is not our intent at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| I can tell you I'll be very upfront with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Two of the streets we're looking at will be partial closures of those two streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| I'll be frank with you up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| The two streets we're looking at, one is Johnny Majors Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| We're looking at doing a project there, which is extending the football practice fields in a garage in a residence hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2941)|
| 0:49:10| That street will be partially closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| The other one is a partial closure of Andy Holt Avenue, which already occurred years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| For those who have been here a long time, we closed a portion of Andy Holt Avenue from Volunteer down to Melrose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| and put a pedestrian mall in there, which has been a tremendous success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| We have gotten rave reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| It, again, adds to a pedestrian-friendly campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| What we're looking at is extending that same mall on Andy Holt Avenue from Melrose down to Francis Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2975)|
| 0:49:43| We hope to do that again to make it easier as students leave the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| They can walk directly to class and never have to experience a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| You've got thousands of kids moving through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Through there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Bell rings, they all hit the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| They all hit the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| It just makes sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Other than that, there are no other plans to close or restrict access to any of the other roads, none whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| I'll tell you that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| I keep asking for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| We'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| We'll take as much time as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I'll be glad to answer those questions for you now if you need more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| I apologize if there's been any thought of secrecy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| That is not our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| We thought from beginning on, because of the fact it takes away the maintenance issues with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| and we're willing to take those on because we feel very strongly about the fact we want to try to do campus beautification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| and those things I mentioned earlier on, that this would be something that would be well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| If you need more information, I'll be glad to give that to you, and we'll sit down with you at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| We're willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| We appreciate your openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you, Mr. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| I want to go ahead and make a motion, but first I want to say part of what we're saying is just exactly what you were saying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| Jeff, is that, and excuse me for calling you that publicly, but we do work over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| but part of it has to do with you're just now telling us about the partial closure of a couple of streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| and I think that's some of the concerns that some of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| And as Councilwoman Palmer said, that many of us just got this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| and so we're concerned about what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| For instance, I have a concern about Lake Loudoun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| which is a main entrance into the campus that does tie in with Volunteer Boulevard in terms of that being closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| or that being turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| So I think that what I'd like to do is I'd like to make a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| or make a motion that we postpone this for 90 days in order to give us time to possibly have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| or whatever, Vice Mayor, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| But I'd like to make a motion that this be postponed for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Yeah, and I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Are these for all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| These are for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| That one fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| This would be for all the streets, and I hope that UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| I also want to say that I personally really appreciate all that UT is doing over there in terms of the beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, it's a big difference than when I was there in the 60s, you know, in terms of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| That's not been that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| And so, but I think that you are making a conscientious effort to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| But I think that by us postponing this and having a chance to really review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| that it's going to keep that dialogue open between both the city and the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| and it will take away any of that possibility of secrecy going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| May I address the council again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Is it a possibility we could make that a shorter time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| I mean, 90 days is three months, and, I mean, we're willing to sit down tomorrow if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Could that be shortened to 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| Well, the problem we've got is we've got a lot of scheduled workshops in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| so it would be very difficult for this group to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| to put you in front of somebody else or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| I mean, there's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| We wouldn't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| I'm sure you wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| But there is a lot of scheduled workshops in place already, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| We have canceled a couple workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| But both of those have to be rescheduled ahead of this because there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| It's a design task force workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Might I ask, Mayor, are there one or two or several that have more urgency than the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| in terms of things you are doing or about to do and, therefore, need to get on with business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| The two I mentioned, Johnny Major's Boulevard and Andy Holt Avenue are the two that are the most pressing on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3207)|
| 0:53:37| It strikes me that Johnny Major's one is fairly minor compared to the Andy Holt Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| So we have a motion to postpone 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Should we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Vice Mayor Pavlis, did you have more to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Well, I just want to say I don't want you to misunderstand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| We're not accusing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| No, I don't think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| I just want to make sure that you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| It's just that it's a big move all at once, and it has raised eyebrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| And, obviously, members of council have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| And the best thing that we can do all moving forward as a team is to have all those questions answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| and any doubts removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| So, I mean, that's the intent of this council this evening from what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| There's no mean-spirited gotcha or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| It's just that there really are, truthfully, a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| and we're hearing from a lot of constituents about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| So, you know, I just don't want you to walk away thinking that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| you got took to the woodshed because that's certainly not the intent of this council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Well, I'll just follow that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| I mean, if you'd given us that information prior to tonight, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| it would have been a lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| I mean, you told us stuff tonight that we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| We really haven't had even a chance, you know, to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| So it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| It's just about getting more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| So I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I went to NBC in August, and no one followed up asking more questions, and that was a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| If I knew we needed to supply more information, we would have been more than willing to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| Again, I apologize if there was any misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you, Mr. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Yeah, I might ask our council here, if he's our head parliamentarian or maybe Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| if going down the pike we find an opportunity to discuss this sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| I assume that we have the ability to adjust the date from the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| In other words, we're not bound by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| If we find an opportunity to meet sooner, we can try to accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Mr. Swanson, whatever, somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| I think you're bound by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| I mean, what you could possibly do is say, let's just postpone right now for sake of argument for 45 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3342)|
| 0:55:51| to see if we're able to find some time where we could do it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| And if that 45 days didn't work out, then we're back to an additional 45-day postponement or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| Because, you know, I mean, an alternative could be to table these, but to take it back off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3362)|
| 0:56:14| you have to put it on an agenda for notice to give folks two weeks' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| That might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| That sounds like taffy that you're stepping into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| At any particular meeting of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| could we not have a motion or a resolution to hear on the next agenda some item that we've?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| Well, that's what tabling would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Yeah, that's essentially how tabling works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| If you do it according to Robert's rules of procedure that are not contradicted by your own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| then if you postpone it, you postpone it to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| And it really won't be 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| It will be first council meeting after 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| And it will probably be late November, early December is what it would probably be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| So it will be the first council meeting after the 90 days passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| That's what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| It wouldn't come back on the agenda until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| But you can table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| As Rob said, you can table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| And then somebody makes a motion in a meeting to take it off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| and put it back on the agenda would be how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| If you want to have the flexibility of doing it that way rather than moving it to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| Again, in the interest of being accommodating, if we got to it sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| we wouldn't want to hold them up any longer than we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3453)|
| 0:57:42| I guess the point at the end of the day is we've still got to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| And that's the whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I mean, if we could do it, you know, any quicker than we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| But, I mean, we've had, you know, a tremendous amount of work, you know, behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And we've got a tremendous amount of work in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| So, I mean, I wish we could do it quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| But even if we table it, you've still got to have the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| So that's the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| I'll call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Councilman, there's a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| There are two more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| Two more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| So there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Is there a second to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| That motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| I'm going to hear back to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| You second the motion to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| All in favor to call for the question, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| The question is to postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| No, the question is to stop debate, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Stop discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I see the lights have turned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| You still wish to speak if this doesn't pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I guess is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Then let me just do the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| This is to call for the question, which means we end the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| I believe that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Do you need a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Two to seven, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| So we will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| I just, I feel like we can do this quicker than three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| We pulled off two workshop items that are hopefully still open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| and I think that falls within the next 60 days, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| It seems like we could try to appease UT and answer all of our questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| with a workshop to fill one of those that has been postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| or excuse me, canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| So I would call for a sooner time frame, like within 60 days we revisit this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| or table it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| I think 90 days is just a bit long for their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| and if they want to move forward with something and we're all happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| then why not try to address that sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| Are you making a motion or not, I guess, is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Yeah, I'll make a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| What is the proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| To amend his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| A motion to amend the motion to change the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Substitute motion to change the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| 60 days we bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| I'll second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Okay, there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| So this is a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| No, you have to amend it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| This is amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| We're amending the we didn't have a do we have a motion and second on the first one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| So this is amending the postponement to 60 days rather than the original 90,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| which was what the motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Yes, I wanted to ask Vice Mayor Pavlis, how many workshops do we already have scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| Do you know off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I don't know off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| but I know that we've got some ones that have come off that need to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| as they come to me is how we schedule them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| So, you know, not having the benefit of my calendar in front of me, I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| But I will, you know, give it all the due respect that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| I just I would hate to say tonight that I could guarantee that within 60 days that we could do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| and then not be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| So that's my hesitancy in committing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| But I do feel like we could get it done in the 90-day time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| We have a motion on the floor about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| We're discussing just the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I think that, Mark, I'm a little concerned about you saying let's appease the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3700)|
| 1:01:49| And I say that because this is an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| I mean, this is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| It's in Councilman Pavlis' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| And I don't know about Nick, but I had no notification of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| This was going to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| And I've had several calls, and just like Councilwoman Palmer says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| there's some concern out there over the credibility of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| And one of the reasons that I would like to see it postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| and definitely have a workshop when we can fit it in is that I don't feel that the university is trying to do something sneaky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| And so I think the best thing for the university and for us is to allow the proper amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| to have a proper workshop to bring the facts forward so that we can then tell our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| look, the university is working in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| Council's working in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| What we're trying to do is come together and make sure this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| It's just unfortunate, and I'll apologize, Jeff, for not getting back to you this afternoon on your phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| I don't know that I could have done anything in that short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| But I want to make sure that we're as transparent as possible, that the university is as transparent as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| It's a whole new group over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| It's a whole new group of people as opposed to five years ago and ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| And these folks are really trying to work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130903?start=3786)|
