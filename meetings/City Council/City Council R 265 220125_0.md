| 0:05:17| First of all, good to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| I want to begin by announcing a big step in our search for our next police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| Earlier today, the job was officially posted and applications are now being accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| I want to thank all of you, both council members and members of the public, who have provided input and continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=331)|

| 0:06:10| Another important item tonight, I want to take the time to publicly recognize the incredible community effort that saved two lives after a trench collapsed on January 13th in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=370)|
| 0:06:21| These types of incidents often do not have good outcomes, and I know a lot of people responsible for saving those two men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| Many of our own city employees were a part of that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| More than 20 Knoxville firefighters and many members of our public service team assisted in this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| City equipment was brought in to help in any way needed, from digging inside the trench to providing medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| I'm so thankful that the two workers' lives were saved, they were rescued, and I'm so proud of everyone who pulled together to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=405)|

| 0:07:27| Well done. Really proud and grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| And I know those two men and their families and loved ones are also incredibly grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Now, as part of my mayor's report, I want to take a moment to recognize Divine Urban Expressions Artistic Director Felicia Utsi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| Felicia was set to be honored by the MLK Commission last week, but was not able to receive her award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| So to help honor her for all her work, and I've had the opportunity to be an audience member for some of her dance performances that she and many children and young people have put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=472)|
| 0:08:04| I'm very impressed with the work, and you all can see on page 21 of the MLK booklet is a full description of her many contributions to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=484)|
| 0:08:14| So to help honor for her work, I would like to invite Deborah Porter, chair of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Commission, and Ms. Utsi to come up to the podium for a brief awards presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=494)|
| 0:08:25| Ms. Porter and Ms. Utsi, please come to the podium to be recognized and have Ms. Porter give you the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And I want to thank Councilwoman McKenzie and Councilwoman Singh for getting this started for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| So thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| We would love to just award Ms. Utsi, give her this award, because as the mayor stated, she was unable to get into the Tennessee Theater due to COVID protocol on January the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=522)|
| 0:08:55| But you have in front of you in the souvenir booklet, page 21, as the mayor has said, her information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| So please refer to that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| But I want you to know how proud we are of Ms. Utsi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Her passion is children and youth and allowing them to express themselves artistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| And she has devoted her entire adulthood and probably teenage years as well to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| She has a son and about five children, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| But Dynamic Ray is one of those who has followed in her footsteps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| The award reads, 2022 Arts Award presented to Ms. Felicia Utsi in recognition of your outstanding accomplishments in the field of performing arts that significantly honors the rich heritage and cultural legacy of our community and for the continued support of Dr. King's dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=569)|

| 0:10:01| And we also have this medallion that we want to give her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| We normally don't give the medallions because they're like gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=605)|

| 0:30:50| So, Council Member Parker, QE2 is the environmental firm that we have on site, so they're continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1850)|

| 0:31:22| cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| So, that firm is available throughout the duration of the construction, so they're there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1883)|

| 0:32:24| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| Yes, on this agenda item, I had concerns because it's a 40% increase in the contract for architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1947)|
| 0:32:36| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| And when I was reading through, the original contract is not included in our packet, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| contract C-19-0283.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| And so I couldn't read the details of that contract, which was approved by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| before I joined City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| But it seems like there was mention of an increase in square footage for the architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1975)|
| 0:33:06| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| I believe the E-911 Center was already a part of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| This is not a new addition, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| So E-911, so this project has a single construction project, owner's rep contract, the QE-2, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| of those contractors are managed by Volkert Engineering, who's our owner's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| E-911 is reimbursing the city for their build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| So they are co-locating on the site, paying for their build-out, including design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| So I can't parse out what part of this is E-911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| It's the total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| But very similar to what the architect is paid based on a percentage of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| That project went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| We actually negotiated the number down quite a bit with the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So this, again, is for their extra several months, multiple months to be on site, provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| additional design consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| It's actually less than what the original contract had called for, and we negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| The same with Volkert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Which is a percentage of the construction contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| I don't have that original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Yes, we negotiated down their amount at the table to drive down their costs as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| possible, both Volkert and the design firm McCarty-Holstaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| They are constantly on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I mean, this is one of the busiest times for the designer to be making modifications to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| design as the contractor finds things on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| But the total square footage of the project hasn't increased since we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Not since the, when you guys reviewed the original overhead is not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| In April 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| April of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| And then also at that meeting in April 2021, part of the discussion was that we, to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| some of the costs, animal control and internet crimes was taken out of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| So animal control and the ITAC folks were originally intended to be in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And they are actually removed pretty early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| And there was some VE, a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| One is there's been some discussion about how we handle animal welfare and animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| and the fact that oftentimes their vehicles and the animals they have trying to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| those into the garage in that neighborhood did not seem to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Plus the long-term vision for the city and county and how we do animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| There's some dialogue around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| The other is ITAC had just had that space renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| And so the nature of their work, they prefer to have a very isolated space for the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| difficult work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| And their space had just been renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| So they are still at Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| In a decade, will they be at Fifth Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| But at the moment, they wanted to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| That was their preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| And instead of kind of squeezing the round pig into the square hole, we made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| that their space was renovated and they wanted to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| It made sense to keep them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I wanted to, I was trying to clarify whether those were added in and that was additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| The only other thing I wanted to bring up during these agenda items was an update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I went back and reviewed our meeting from April 21st of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| And that was a big part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| There was talk of the Clayton Museum potentially pursuing a new design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2204)|
| 0:36:54| I think at the time you said the city would request a six-month lease extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| I just wondered what's an update on Clayton and our lease term with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| Mayor, you want to jump in and I can fill in the gaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Council Member Parker, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I've had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Clayton when I first became mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And then, you know, everything was sort of put on hold during the initial year of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| pandemic for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| And it has been, in a way, an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I've met with him, I think, twice since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| And people are reimagining the way science museums should be interactive in the age of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| you know, the post-COVID or during COVID era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| And so at our most recent meeting, he brought with him a museum professional who does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2260)|
| 0:37:49| and has done this, you know, in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| And so it seems like he is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| He's expressed his commitment to me multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| And we are continuing to have those conversations with him and express our support for him moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| And the good news is that, you know, for a variety of reasons that, you know, we won't need to extend the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| You know, the police department is going to be vacating their current safety headquarters this summer and be able to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| And so there's going to be no need to find a second location or to extend a lease anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| So the conversations are ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| You know, the ball's in his court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| And we are, you know, continuing to talk to him and encourage him to move forward as expeditiously as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I just wanted to clarify for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| I did vote against this, you know, $20 million increase for the public service complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2321)|
| 0:38:51| But I am voting in favor of these items because we've made the commitment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| So now that we've made the commitment, that means we have to honor the agreement that we've made with the architecture and other parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2336)|
| 0:39:06| So I'm still opposed to the increase in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| I wish we could have changed that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| But now that we've made the commitment, I am voting in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2356)|

| 0:40:33| Council members, I just want to note that this agreement will allow the addition of a memorial honoring our Vietnam veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| I want to recognize and publicly thank the East Tennessee Veterans Memorial Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| Some members are here, the Veterans Memorial Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| I see Dr. Pat Polis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Ron Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| And I know Doug Campbell is here representing you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| We appreciate your efforts to honor our Vietnam veterans right here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| and look forward to council members' support of this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| If you have any questions for them, they're here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| If you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Ms. Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Or is your light left from another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I had a few questions, and honestly, I think my questions are more about the agreement between the city and PVA from 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2479)|
| 0:41:34| more so than it is about the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| But when reading through all of the materials, it seems like there's a 25-year lease in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2498)|
| 0:41:47| and we are in year 15, I believe, with an option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| And just some things that popped out to me as concerning is that PVA is able to take noncompetitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2513)|
| 0:42:03| or enter into noncompetitive negotiations for lease agreements for public property that it manages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| and it just seems like there is a lack of public input into this process, a lack of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2531)|
| 0:42:20| And I'm wondering what groups have access to even knowing that this is an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| to be able to, you know, rent a portion of PVA-managed city-owned land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2548)|
| 0:42:37| I also wonder what the vision is for the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| But those are some questions that came to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| How does he – what is PVA's process for identifying potential tenants for city-owned properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| Well, Ms. Parker, I think that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| I don't think that's germane to what's right before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| which we're doing a more narrow thing within the confines of the existing agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| to honor our Vietnam veterans and add to our memorials for all veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| I think that's a good question, and we could ask Jane Berg from PVA to come speak to those broader issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| if a council wants to have a workshop or answer by email or phone call as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| You know, I ask in relation to this agenda item because I want to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| agreements and contracts that we authorize have been entered into in a manner that is transparent and fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2609)|
| 0:43:41| and that opportunities that are available are available to all in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| And so that's just one reason, but are you saying that there's no one here who could answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| Well, I'm not sure – your questions were very broad and like about PVA and the future of World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| and we're not – I'm not prepared to answer all those questions right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| and it's not really on what we're voting on or what you are voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| But if council wants to have a workshop on that kind of issue in the future, I'm certainly open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| But, yeah, I'm not prepared to answer the future of World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I mean, we're celebrating the 40th anniversary of this park this year, and I'm really excited about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| and that can be something that we discuss at greater length, but I'm not prepared to go into that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| Okay, let me bring some brevity to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| How was this particular organization chosen to have access to space in the World's Fair Park for leasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2677)|
| 0:44:51| I think Rick Emmett is here, or Ms. Welch, did you have – you know, I think it's a pretty ordinary thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| but Ms. Welch or Dr. – Mr. Brace, either of you want to field that? I'm not exactly sure it's a precise question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| I think, look, this group and the veterans that are here today, the Vietnam veterans that are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| are associated with the longstanding veteran memorial that is down there now that I think all of city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| previous city councils approved that negotiation for that memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| And so this group has a direct connection to that memorial, and it engaged the city and PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| who PBA obviously has a board of citizens, and I'm not sure if Mr. Swanson wants to talk about that governance structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| but again, obviously city council is seeing it tonight in the memorial and the existing memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| This seemed to be a very applicable use for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Swanson, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| No, I would just say that the public building authority is a public entity that has been created under state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2746)|
| 0:45:55| and they follow the state statutes with regard to all of the things that they do, including these types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| Morris Kaiser is their general counsel, and Morris does a great job of giving them advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| and I certainly anticipate that they follow all the necessary requirements and laws related to awarding of contracts and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2768)|
| 0:46:19| But without having any warning, I can't give you a history of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you, Mr. Swanson. Any other questions or discussion? Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you, Mayor. I believe I was on city council at the time that process went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| This was an organization of men and women, well-meaning individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| that wanted to recognize those members of the community that had been involved in wars over the decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| There was a search for an appropriate, respectful place for this memorial to be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2812)|
| 0:47:00| and there was an agreement that was reached with the group, with the city of Knoxville, with the involvement of PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2820)|
| 0:47:10| I want to say in the mid-2005, 2006 time frame, it's down on World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2830)|
| 0:47:19| It's, loosely speaking, it's near the LNN STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Looking at this, the area that's going to be involved is right there adjoining it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| and it looks like, to me, it's approximately five one-hundredths of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| which would just be, the proposal would be a modest expansion of their present footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| But I was there for the first part of it. Thank you, Mr. Frost. Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| I'm not opposed to this agenda item, but I would like for us to consider some sort of public input process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2873)|
| 0:48:03| so that we can hear back from the community. Since this has been installed, have you enjoyed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| Do you think it's a good use of the World's Fair Park? Would you like to see it expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| What else would you like to see at the World's Fair Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| I just wonder if we've heard any feedback from the community over the last 15 years about this addition to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| and whether we could consider that type of input at the end of this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2903)|
| 0:48:33| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to say that the East Tennessee Veterans Memorial is a very special place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| and a place that's very needed to honor folks who've served in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| I just wanted to take a moment and ask if anyone, I know we have people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| if you could maybe make a comment for us about why this particular memorial for service during Vietnam is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2934)|
| 0:49:03| I'm Dr. Pat Paulis, President of the Captain Bill Robinson Chapter 1078 of Vietnam Veterans of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2943)|
| 0:49:17| As a 22-year-old captain and company commander in Vietnam, when I came home my first tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| I was spit on, cursed, and had urine thrown on me, all because I did my duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| I'm one of 2.7 million that had boots on the ground during what was considered not a war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| There are less than 600,000 of us left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| All we ask is for a small piece of property, for a memorial, not just for those of us remaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| but for our children and our grandchildren, so that it will serve not only as a place of memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| because we served faithfully and served this country well, but a place of healing for those of us who still need healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=2993)|
| 0:50:03| That's all we're asking for, for a permit to build and to place a Tennessee stone there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| with the appropriate markings as a memorial to all that we did to serve this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| Those of us are proud to be a part of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| I just want to thank you, sir, for your service, and I think I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| This is a very important place to have a memorial for those who served during Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| I know I have family members who served during that era, and I'm sure many of us on this stage do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3032)|
| 0:50:42| Certainly those watching at home and here today may have served or have family members who have served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| I think this is a very important memorial that we need to provide space for in recognition of that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3049)|
| 0:50:57| and I do hope this ends up being a place where veterans can find some peace, as you mentioned in your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| And I just think, given what your remarks were, we should all take a moment and just thank all of you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| Thank you, Vice Member Berto. Thank you, Dr. Paulus. I think Ms. Fugate had your light on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3071)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you, Mayor. I just can't speak passionately enough about how important I think this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3095)|
| 0:51:45| Everybody knows my story. We don't need to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| I just think that we have a group who's asked to use the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| It is a good use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| The Veterans Memorial has been a place where ceremonies take place, people go to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| It is a wonderful addition to our community, is a fantastic addition to the World's Fair Park, and I call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3123)|

| 0:54:02| and add safety to our neighborhoods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I'm really glad to be having this on the agenda for you all this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3245)|

| 0:54:33| Again, just wanted to reiterate these ADA accessibility amenities make a huge difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| for community members throughout our city, and I'm really glad that we're making these investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| Any questions or discussion? Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| Yeah, I'd like to ask Mr. Cannon a quick question. I don't know if he can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| So the curb cuts funding, is that literally just the curb cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| And the reason I'm asking, let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Some of the areas where there's the ADA curb cuts accessibility at the end of a block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| there's the black bubble square pad at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| Does that include that? Is that the whole sidewalk section and all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Yes, ma'am. Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| The pad that you're speaking of is for the sight-impaired public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| So if there's a distinction before they leave a sidewalk area going into traffic, that is a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| There's other things that can be done if you don't necessarily see that pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| There's other things that meet the ADA requirements, but you are correct that that is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| So the reason I ask about those, and I just want to point them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| is some of them have broken free in some places, like in my neighborhood areas I walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| And I don't know if there's a way to, like, bolt them in place or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| but I'm not sure how they are attached to those ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| There is an adhesive, and there's also a bolting mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| If you'll give me a list of where they have broken off, we'll get those taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Okay, okay. I think what happens is when people see them, they don't know what to do about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| and they move them around when they mow the grass, and they just kind of float around and maybe happen to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| Anyway, I just, in the future, I'm not sure what's specific in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| The ones that are bolted down obviously stay better than the ones that are adhered with adhesive down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| There's really feedback I wanted to give out since we're talking about this particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3401)|

| 0:58:09| you may have seen it as the old bait shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| That building was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| And once we looked at it, we realized that it is an amenity and a connection to an existing park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| Right next to it is our skate park, our Fountain City skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| We have some stone water property on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3501)|

| 0:58:31| So the area really creates this true park feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And having that one missing link ties all that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3515)|

| 1:00:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Okay, next item is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| We have four people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| First is Mr. John Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3648)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you, Mayor and Council, for allowing me to come up here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| My name is John Coker, 5514 Nickel Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| This is my second time here asking for help from the City of Knoxville on the improvement of Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3672)|
| 1:01:21| It's in bad shape, and I will have to say the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| and somebody has made some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| They've repaved about 50 yards of it and put in some drainage, which has helped some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| but it does not alleviate the problem of the narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| There are four 90-degree curves on this road, and some are hidden with hills and curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| There are two blind hills at the entrance of a subdivision that they're wanting to put in with about 20 more houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| with a blind hill on either side of the entrance to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| There are three schools, two churches in connection with this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| There are already two subdivisions that are using this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| There are power poles and trees within one foot of the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| There are four different locations where vehicles have hit these power poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| They're still there, they're bent, and in one place there's three poles there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| One of them is completely missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| The road is so narrow it has not been striped in parts of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| If you have an average-sized vehicle and you meet a bigger vehicle on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| you're apt to lose a mirror or run into the ditch because there are no shoulders on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| If you're having an emergency, you've got emergency vehicles, you've got fire trucks, you've got police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| you've got utility workers coming in with KUB, safety for the school buses that travel this road morning and night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3780)|
| 1:03:11| There's nowhere to go if you meet a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Somebody's going to get killed on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| There's already been wrecks, and I think at the last meeting there was a lady here that had actually been in a wreck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| and her little son was injured, and he was autistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| And it's because of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| It's a 1940s wagon path, and there has been no updates made on the road except for repaving in places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3812)|
| 1:03:42| Somebody's going to get killed, and I hope it doesn't happen, but it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3822)|
| 1:03:51| Knoxville is projected to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I hope it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| It has grown in the past 50 years, but there's a substation going in on Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| and it's a pretty good size one by the looks of it, and it's next to power lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| where there are two sets of different power lines crossing Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| Is there going to be new construction with vehicles, power poles, and equipment using this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| Using this road is too narrow for the amount of traffic we have on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| The city has made a lot of improvements in a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| It's all appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| We've got greenways and parks, and a couple miles from where I live, I call it the bridge with nowhere to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3871)|
| 1:04:40| because there's nothing on either end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| It's a pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| It's been up for about three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| I go by it three or four times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| I have yet to see anybody on that bridge, and it's a pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| There's a cemetery on one end and a creek on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| It's across Western Avenue just past 517.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| If anybody wants to come and look, and if anybody wants to come out or get in touch with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| I'll be glad to take them down Nickel Road and show them a lot more of these things that need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3909)|
| 1:05:19| Like I said, I know the city has spent a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| but there has been an infrastructure bill that's passed through the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| and we should be able to get a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| We're talking about 1.4 miles of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| It's a safety for the community concern, and everybody lives on the road and travels the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| It's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Again, I thank you for listening to me, for taking your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| but I would very much love to be able to talk to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| If somebody would like to talk to me, I'll give you my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| I'll be sitting here for just a minute, and I'll talk to anybody at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| and I can take you on a tour of the road, anything you want to do, but we need help, and we need it bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3964)|
| 1:06:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Next person signed up is Elizabeth Allman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| Ms. Allman, you can come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| Start by stating your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=3986)|
| 1:06:44| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| My name is Elizabeth Allman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| I live at 5317 Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| I am the person that Mr. Coker has mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| I have taken out a telephone pole and landed in a ditch with my three-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| First of all, I want to say thank you for your response after the last time I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| I'm beyond thrilled that within a day someone was out on Nickel Road working on ditches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| and I'm super thrilled with that kind of momentum, if we could just keep it going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| because right now Mr. Coker had stated that there is a stretch of road that is paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| We got white lines painted on the side of the road, but unfortunately it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| I live on the section that is so narrow that only one car can fit through at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| If multiple cars come through, you have to pull off into someone's front yard to allow someone else to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4063)|
| 1:07:52| My driveway is insanely steep, so I cannot pull out of my driveway without rolling down my window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| and listening for traffic, because one of the curves that Mr. Coker has spoken of is right in front of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| at the intersection of Grapevine and Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| I have to listen for the traffic to come, because I cannot see around that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| I would like to please ask the City of Knoxville if you could look at not just widening the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4096)|
| 1:08:25| covering the drainage ditches that the engineer, who has been phenomenal at what he's done so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| filling in those ditches once he has the drainage covered, and then widening that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| so that someone else will not end up in an accident like I did where someone crossed that center line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| and sent me into that ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| If we could do that and continue the momentum there, but I was also hoping that we could consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| maybe a couple of speed tables, something through there, because just since the last meeting to now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4134)|
| 1:09:02| I've been in near three other accidents on the same road, and one of which, the woman was going nearly 50 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| coming at me at the stop sign at Western Avenue where it turns into Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| And that is absurd to go through the amount of curves and the blind spots and the narrowness of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| going at that speed. It is not designed to go more than 25 miles an hour, and yet we have people going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| the speed of a highway on that road, and that is putting our citizens in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| And I feel like something as simple as a speed table on top of repairing those sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| and then, unfortunately, I have one more issue to bring to your attention with this road, is the school zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| Like Mr. Coker stated, we have schools and churches all on this road, and one in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| is at the corner of Oak Ridge Highway and Nickel Road where it's turned into Jimmy Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| And at that intersection, you turn out onto Oak Ridge Highway where the speed limit is normally 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| but in the school zone is knocked down to 30. During that area, once you've turned from Nickel Road onto that highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4211)|
| 1:10:20| you have no clue you're in a speed zone at all. And so you're expecting to go the speed of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| but you've got people now going 45 miles an hour in a school zone. That's dangerous for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| And I do know that Ridgedale School at that intersection is not allowed to have pedestrian traffic from their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4234)|
| 1:10:43| but we don't know. I've had an autistic nephew who has escaped from a school like Ridgedale in a sensory meltdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4243)|
| 1:10:53| and I understand that where there are not normally students who walk the streets near Oak Ridge and Nickel Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| it can happen. And wouldn't it be wonderful if our city could prepare for those worst-case scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4261)|
| 1:11:10| so that we're not putting some child in danger and that we are keeping our families on that road safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| by allowing bus traffic, by allowing just that little extra wiggle room on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| so that if we have to sway to avoid an oncoming car so we don't break a mirror off of our own vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| if we could allow that space for our emergency vehicles to get through when we need them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| that would be amazing if this team could come together and keep the momentum going of what we have so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| so that we can make Nickel Road a much safer place for everybody who travels it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| Thank you, Ms. Allman. Next person is Tina Sparks. Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4308)|
| 1:12:02| You could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4322)|
| 1:12:17| My name is Tina Sparks. I live at 612 Avenue A, Vestal. I come here tonight to speak on another issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4337)|
| 1:12:35| but I have a change of heart, and I'm hoping that I can yield some of my time to another member that's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4355)|
| 1:12:48| Is that permissible? No. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| Mayor, would I be able to make a motion to amend our rules so she would be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| You can make a motion. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| I'd like to make a motion that we amend our rules, suspend our rules, sorry. I keep saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Suspend our rules for the evening so that Ms. Sparks is able to shorten her portion of public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4390)|
| 1:13:19| and allow the remaining time to be allocated to the next public forum speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4399)|
| 1:13:29| Yeah, we don't know who the next public speaker is signed up as by duty. Is that, I mean, is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| Oh, is the person not signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| No, this is someone who's not signed up to speak, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| Well, then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| Well, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Yeah, I bet I'm going to get support for adding another public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| So the motion is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Moving right along. Go ahead, you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| So I'll just speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| Last time we were here, I was here, there was an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4448)|
| 1:14:17| There was a person who was obviously having some trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4457)|
| 1:14:31| and I know at the beginning of every city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| the mayor goes over the rules about not speaking on turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| and not interrupting, not using profanity and all those things, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| Everybody should know that ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| This person was obviously in distress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Two, three, maybe, law enforcement came over to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4502)|
| 1:15:15| trying, I think, to console her, to offer her some comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4515)|
| 1:15:25| There was another person who was speaking that night, and I can't remember her name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| but what she was talking about was obviously triggering this person over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4530)|
| 1:15:42| And no note from any of you was made of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| I don't think, I don't know, surely you recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| I'm going to speak to a different matter, but that has been preying on my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4553)|
| 1:16:01| that we sat here, that the meeting was, there was a recess even, because of the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4561)|
| 1:16:11| But it was not a recess of compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| a recess of, let's get this person some help and let's address her issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4576)|
| 1:16:28| I'm going to read just very quickly, and then, because my time is almost up, some words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| So much sickness came from the improper place to live, long distance to walk to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4596)|
| 1:16:46| Too much work at home, natural conditions common to the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| that take the bright flowers like terrible cold in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| Those are the words of Buford Delaney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| another person who struggled all his life here in Knoxville, in Boston, in New York, in Paris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4625)|
| 1:17:15| with emotional, mental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| I struggle with that every day as well, as do, I'm sure, several people here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| But when we don't recognize that people like the woman that I'm referencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4648)|
| 1:17:40| when we don't recognize their value, it does a disservice to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4660)|
| 1:17:50| And I just hope that the next time someone is in crisis here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| that there will be someone who will address that, address it publicly, publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| Thank you, and this is a really good book. It's at the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| I work at the library, and it's called A Life of Buford Delaney, Amazing Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| I think it's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you, Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Next person signed up to speak is Greg Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| Sorry, I missed the meeting last week. I try to be here every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| It's a privilege to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| I wanted to touch on a couple issues, one of them quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| We're trying to revitalize and get going on the cemetery cleanup over off Keith and Richmond Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| those historic African-American cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| I'll leave the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Kind of got set behind with the heavy growth in the summer and with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| but it's a little easier to kind of do cleanup when things aren't so grown in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| We've set up and we still have that Hotmail account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| It is knoxcemeteryrehab, knoxcemeteryrehab at hotmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4747)|
| 1:19:16| I wanted to suggest to those who are viewing and those who are here tonight in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| that I found a real good way to get things done in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| I think speaking in public forums can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| Knowing who your city council member is also helps, and utilizing 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4771)|
| 1:19:40| Sometimes it's as simple as calling 215-2075, the city council office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| and being put on the speaking list for these public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| but also asking who your city council person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| And I'll bet that probably more than half the adult population in town does not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| Getting to know these great servants who are sitting before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| and utilizing 311 really helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| I just got off the phone earlier this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| and I'm going to ask the mayor and the city for some help on the Baxter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| I'm not sure which city council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| It might be Ms. Ryder or Ms. Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| but they've been redoing the sidewalks on the east side of Baxter and 275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4823)|
| 1:20:33| This has been going on for a while, and when you come off on the northbound exit to Baxter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| it's real rough and it's dropped off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| and the neighbors and I are asking that we can get a little bit of blacktop put down in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| and fill that in before they put the final coat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| It's kind of a safety issue, and it's real rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| So I made the call to 311 last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| and actually the lady I spoke with lives in that neighborhood, and she agrees with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| So from her conversation, I understand, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| that you've hired about three new people within the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| I think we have seven now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| I've got to know them all by name because I'm all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| I'm always trying to look for improvements, and they need our eyes and our ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| So it's a challenge to the public watching to utilize your council members and utilize 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| They do some great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| Also, I've been concerned, as most of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| and I've been working with Law Sheet Ministry on Wednesday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| We haven't missed a Wednesday in 22 years since Maxine Rain started the Blackstock-Aylor Avenue Wednesday night service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4902)|
| 1:21:53| But I went down, and I go through that area, and I encourage all council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| not just those whose district it might border or be part of, to drive down there and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| It's got really, really, really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| The railroad cleaned up their property, and where did those people go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| They're all in the streets and the sidewalks between there and Broadway, and it's just sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| It's a terrible mess, and I commend the city, commend you, Mayor, for having someone like Sean Griffith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4939)|
| 1:22:27| the Homeless Program Coordinator, but we need to do more for this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| I want to be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| I know a lot of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| They all go through my food line every week, all 100 to 140 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| Tommy's been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| There's some nice people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| There's a variety of people that are marginalized, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| They're all judged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| They're stereotyped, and it's a population I think we can do better with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| So I'm asking for a little bit of help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Finally, congratulations to all of the folks who got reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| I was at the swearing-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| I got to see just about everybody up here at the swearing-in in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| It was wonderful, and I appreciate all that you do to serve us, those that got reelected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| as well as those who are continuing to serve, and congratulations to Mr. Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| and thank you for your service, Gwen, for serving as vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| Hope you all have a good weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| God bless everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you, Mr. Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Council members, that concludes public forum, and without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220125?start=5018)|
