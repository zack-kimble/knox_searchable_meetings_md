| 0:01:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=63)|

| 0:01:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| We're all accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| There's been a motion and a second to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| The minutes have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Thank you, Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Item 12A has to do with a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| I met with the pension board and it was Mayor Rojero's first meeting and she is the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| chair of the pension board and Mr. Saunders, our personal representative, was also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| And the pension board is looking at some things that would alter their rules of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| that would make them come in compliance with what we would like to see happen without having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| I'd like to go on record that I'm not eager to have charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| I think that it's a very difficult thing and very confusing things for voters and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| probably have enough of those as it is from the state and other levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| So I would request that we postpone this until the February 21st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| That will give the pension board an opportunity to meet and to take some kind of action and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| decision and then on the 21st we would bring this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| More discussion or another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| Well, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| I do know that the pension board's attorney and general manager are looking into some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=162)|
| 0:02:50| language that will put this in the rules, which is a little different than just us doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| And I'm not sure that we will have acted by the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| If that, I did talk to Mike Cherry today at length and I do understand that this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| be a rules thing, which would be really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| If by the 21st it's not an action item, but we know that it's coming down the road, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| I'll make a decision possibly to withdraw it at that point if this is really in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Councilman Thayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| I guess my question, my issue is in terms of how long we want to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=206)|
| 0:03:41| What ballot would you be looking to get this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| If we act soon enough, I believe that it would go on the August ballot of 2012 and if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| on the November ballot of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Am I correct, Mr. Swanson, you advise this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I had worked with Mr. Swanson on this a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| We have postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| The pension board has changed membership and so I think that I felt very uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| in some ways because this was their first meeting and this was like, pow, this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| I think that by the 21st of February, we would know that they are really going to make these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| rules changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| If not, we could still postpone it until after their March meeting and have time to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| My only issue is that in case there were other reforms, just to sort of deal with them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| I mean, I'm supportive of this, but just in terms of having them all together there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| That's a concern I have also, that we may have multiple pension board issues at not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| only the city level, but perhaps at the county level and then the state is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| some things on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| So, I also share that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you, Ms. Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| I agree with your concerns and I would like to deal with them all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| This one is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| It's a procedural thing with the pension board itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| I think the greater pension issues will be things that will come before us, hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| in workshops and plenty of opportunities to have them fully aired, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| There's a motion and a second to postpone item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Are there any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Any consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I guess Councilman Graver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| I'd like to add 12B to the consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| It's a motion to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| There's a motion and a second to add 12B to the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=354)|

| 0:06:12| Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Is there a motion to approve the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Moved and seconded to approve the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=377)|

| 0:06:20| And it is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Well, I want to, first of all, recognize the completion of the Extreme Makeover Home Edition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| that was filmed on Robinson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| I know that all wrapped up last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Unfortunately, I was not in town for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| I was at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, so I was not able to be there at the completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| but I read about it, and I know that Daniel and Mandy Watson and their children and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| families that they support through their restoration houses are all very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| And I want to thank all the volunteers, all of those thousands of people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| and the hundreds of businesses that participated, to thank them, first of all, and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| our own Christy Branscombe, who will be joining this administration in a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| She and her husband and their construction company were the contractors for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| And the weather wasn't always friendly, but things got completed, and I think it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| a lot about our town, how well that went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| I want to thank our city employees who participated in that, along with all the other citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| to make sure that people were safe and that there was access for the people that lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| in the neighborhoods so they could get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| I also want to thank Councilwoman Palmer, and I hope that you will convey to your local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| residents out there in your district our thanks for their patience with the road closing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| all the trucks and buses and lights and all the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| I know it was difficult to be a neighbor there, but I think ultimately, in the end, I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| we can all feel good as a community for what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| I also want to mention about the same time as the makeover was going on, Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| our community development director, and I and other staff went to Lonsdale for the groundbreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| for two new affordable houses on Bishop Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| These are houses that will be built by the East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| which is one of our nonprofit housing partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| They will be building these houses through funding that they get from the city through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| the community development department, and this program takes vacant or blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| and creates affordable, energy efficient housing for low and moderate income buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| Those homes should be on the market by this summer, and then the money, the sale of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| homes goes back into funding that program again so more families can have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| that type of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| And finally, I just want to remind you all that a week from Friday is the budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| This is a meeting where city council and the mayor and the administration come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| to talk about where our budget is now, six months or so into the fiscal year, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| our expectations are for the budget come July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| So that will be at the John T. O'Connor Center at 8 a.m. on Friday, February 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| And that is all that I have, so I'll call on Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| As many folks probably know, Mr. Swanson has changed seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| He's come down two or three seats, and we've been in the mix of finding us a replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| for some very large shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| And we were, I think we were successful last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I'd like to welcome Rob Frost as the chosen finalist for the position of the attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| for the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| I don't know if condolences are due, but anyway, we're just glad that we finally have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| we have some really good candidates, and it was a very hard decision for us to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| But I think Rob and his experience, you know, is what carried the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| So I'd just like to welcome him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| We've still got a little bit of paperwork to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| but I feel very confident that we'll be able to do that with quick haste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| and finalize it and get down to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| So, Rob, if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Well, first, I'd like to thank the members of council for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| There were 17 applicants, well-qualified folks who would have done this body a good job of representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=642)|
| 0:10:52| I greatly appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| It's vaguely familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| It's nice to be around so many people that I consider friends that I was away from for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| I was fortunate enough for eight years to sit next to Mr. Swanson and lean on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| Then I will continue to seek his experience that he gained while he was seated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| That's all I can promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Welcome, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| It's great to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Also, before I call any other members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| I want to just recognize Mark Donaldson and tell him that our thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| and prayers go out to you and your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| I know you lost your mom recently and just want you to know that we're thinking about you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| and, as I said, our thoughts and prayers are with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| I just wanted to give council an update on where we are on the signed ordinance review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| the task force that I was asked to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Hopefully by the next council meeting in two weeks, not only will I have all the members named by then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| but also a schedule of events and where we're headed and what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Presently, we do have three members from the chamber on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| We also have two people, one representing scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| and also two neighborhood groups we're waiting to hear from one more person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| So that's why I'd rather not say all the names tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| We also will have someone from the mayor's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| We'll have someone from MPC, also from the building officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| and also we've asked for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| So we're putting that together and hope to really begin our meeting starting in February on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| Also, I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson if he could give us an update on the situation with the shingles, the dumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| the two dumps, one in east and one in west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| I can give you a little update on that because there is some enforcement action underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| As you know, a number of citations have already been issued with respect to those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| Unfortunately, the citations were insufficient to cause the activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| that is in violation of the zoning code to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| And so yesterday, the law department filed an action in the chancery court seeking injunctive relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| against these unlawful uses of these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| There will be a hearing with regard to a temporary injunction on February the 6th in the chancery court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| and then sometime after that when the court sets it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| there will be a hearing on a request for a permanent injunction prohibiting this unlawful use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=809)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| One, I wanted to thank Chief Roush for hosting a meeting with the business representatives over the secondhand law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| There are still some issues going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| but it was a productive meeting and a chance for folks to get together and talk both about the purpose of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| and problems people foresaw that might affect their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| And I hope that we're working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| The other item is tomorrow in the fourth district at 2 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| there's going to be a meeting with some businesses and police about a separate matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| the crime and some of the loitering activities that are going on that are affecting the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| and we thought it was a good idea to get both teams together and not only share information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| but learn how to work together better as citizens in a police force to address those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| So 2 o'clock tomorrow at the Time Warp Deli, we expect to have some businesses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and some representatives from the police department will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| and maybe some neighborhood representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Any other reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| We'll move on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| 8A on page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Actually, Councilman Della Volpe has asked me to give you page numbers tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| since it's our first time with a new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=904)|

| 0:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| We have Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I'd like to see a provision in this type of agreement where you're giving somebody, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| built the fence, it's in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| The way this agreement is written is that if the fence comes down, they get to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| to put it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| And I think it ought to have a provision that it's built in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| It's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| It's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| It's fine where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| But if it should come down, then that fence, then it should be required to pull it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| into compliance and out of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| That can be done if that would be Council's preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Would that be done in the form of an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Well, it would probably be easier if we simply postponed it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and let the law department craft the necessary language to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| and then bring it back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Yes, this is in my district, and it's one that I've been following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| This is a situation that during a storm, a tree fell on the existing fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| And what happened was that they went ahead and put the fence back where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| And some of you should have received, or all of you should have received today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| e-mails from all the neighbors saying that there's no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Also, the chairman of the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| could not be here this evening, but said they have no objections to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| If any of you have been over to see where the house is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| in terms of when the house was built originally and where the fence was put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| even when they went back to survey to really find out exactly where the property was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| there was some discrepancy in terms of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| This is one of the areas in Sequoia Hills where the road is pretty narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| and there were some problems even defining where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| But the main thing that happened here was that a portion of the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| was blown over during the storm, and the young couple that lived there went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| and had the fence really put back where it was, and at the time they did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| they went ahead and replaced the rest of the fence in the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| A problem has arisen, and one of the reasons that I would ask it not be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| is that, unfortunately, this couple, the husband, has been transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| and has already moved, and in order for them to sell the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| they need to have this thing taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| And so, again, I understand what Councilman Wallace has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| and I do realize we have situations all over the city where we have existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| whether they're fences or sheds or carports or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| but I think in this particular case that if we could go ahead and pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Mr. Swanson, I see a provision in the agreement under Section 4, Paragraph 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| that indicates if the city ever wants them to get out of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| that we give them notice and they have to follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| In other words, they cannot obstruct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| But I understood the request was that you could not rebuild the fence again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| that it would somehow lapse once the fence came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| How do you view that provision as helping the city, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| maintain its roads and its needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Provision 4 provides that if the city needs this right-of-way for any purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| we can require them at their cost to remove the encroachment at the time the city needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| So it does say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| It does not say, however, and I think what is being requested is there's a provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| if something ever happens to the fence and it should come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| that it could not be re-erected at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| It does not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| So there is a difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| In my view, the provision in Paragraph 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and I was just going to call your attention to that paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| so we were thinking along similar lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| means that I just don't see the city being harmed by this particular encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| so long as the city can require it to be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| If the city ever has reason to need the encroachment removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| and it can be required to be removed at the owner's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| So it's whatever council wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| One of my concerns is I guess if we sort of make the fence either have to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| or be completely removed, I wonder if it somehow gets dilapidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| rather than people fixing it up over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| And I would worry about do we encourage an unattractive fence to kind of deteriorate in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| because once you move it, you lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| But I'll abide by whatever the council wants to do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Well, let me just give further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| If you've been out to see the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| you'll notice on the drawing that given their site plan that where the fence is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| it is extremely close to the rear of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| And that is actually their backyard that you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And actually the front of the house, if you go east on the drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| that is all a hill that goes down to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| So the only flat area of the yard is really right there in the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| And you'll see where it says asphalt drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| That's a pull-off from the road at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| But, Mr. Swanson, what you're saying is item number four gives the city the right to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| and take back the right-of-way at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So the city is covered if, in fact, they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| So we're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Again, I would recommend acceptance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Lester, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Please give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Rex Hamilton, 535 Chippewa Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I'm the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Thank you, Mayor and Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| You know, just here to, as Councilman Grieve said, communicate the urgency of the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| and this is actually something along with the variance for the height that we've been working on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| And I'm trying to get the property in order to list, and this is just kind of one of the final things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| So I'm just here to really kind of second the urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| The time is of the essence, certainly with my wife and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Right now, I believe we have a motion and a second to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Any further discussion or motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Well, I mean, I make the motion that you amend it to say that if it ever is torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| or is fallen down again in the future, that the fence has to be pulled back out of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| I mean, I've seen a lot of permanent use agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| I can tell you, the most ones that I'm familiar with, that it has a provision that if it ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| the fence ever does come down, that it has to be pulled back into the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I understand the urgency and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| And I'm fine with the fence being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| But I just, someday it ought to get corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| That motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| We go back to the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1619)|

| 0:27:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Yeah, I thought maybe if I can, Mayor, I'd like to ask Mr. Hageman or Mr. King about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1648)|
| 0:27:36| This is obviously a good title review firm and a legal firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| And I noticed the item after this has to do with a title company identifying properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| Could you just give us a nickel's worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| We're talking about the project where we're going to change the texture, so to speak, of Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| and make it more pedestrian friendly and change the lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| Is this to look at the specific properties we're going to touch upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| There's some 60-odd properties that either, I guess in a few cases, title has to be purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1686)|
| 0:28:17| In other cases, there's an easement that has to be purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| And all of this work is to make sure that there's clear title to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| And some of them are small and miscellaneous little slices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1710)|

| 0:30:29| Oh, we have a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Commissioner Gallivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| If Mr. Donaldson is still here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I understood that MPC said that there were a number of districts involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| and that we can deal with that by dealing with the setback requirements in each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| but that it might be prudent to ask you to go ahead and sort of review the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| and sort of scrub it so that these are clear and maybe uniform and less hard to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| Is that a fair representation of what you guys asked us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| That's stated much better than we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Is that something that would be a major task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| or is that just a little staff time reviewing the actual designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| and coming up with a uniform chart or something that tells you what to do on setbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| It's a fairly significant task, but one that is definitely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| The Planning Commission has already asked staff to take a look at the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| that apply to outdoor storage areas in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| and just as with fences the regulations and requirements are sporadic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| and sprinkled throughout the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| so we're in the process of trying to consolidate all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| Once you take that step, then you're looking at fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| and landscape buffering as kind of logical extensions of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| So we would like to prepare a package to deal with all three of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| and I think we can do it fairly expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120124?start=1921)|
