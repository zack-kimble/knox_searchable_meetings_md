| 2:33:39| Yes, I do have several comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| Needless to say, I've really studied this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| Julie, I appreciate your advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| I appreciate that you have brought people together to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| There was a string of emails just a day or two ago that I didn't realize you weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9239)|
| 2:34:06| copied on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| The major things that presented such a problem to this back before I was on commission, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9247)|
| 2:34:23| thinking in a very positive way have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| I think the fact that there is none of the residents from Northampton Way are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9267)|
| 2:34:34| speaks volumes because I do know that there's been quite a bit of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| There's four of them that have been very active in this with Smithfield and with Josh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9279)|
| 2:34:48| particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| The one thing, the main thing really is the Patriot's Way access that everyone is addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9291)|
| 2:34:59| And my understanding is Smithfield would not access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9299)|
| 2:35:11| However, given the fact that we don't have that in writing, Mr. Mullins, that promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| that might be something we would want to address and I'll come back to that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9318)|
| 2:35:24| The three main complaints that were presented by the neighbors in all of this, the one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9324)|
| 2:35:31| the Patriot's Way access which I'm thinking has been addressed and really even made better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9331)|
| 2:35:40| the fact that they are going to have the common area and they're going to build a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| that the new community and Northampton can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| I think it was a real effort at hearing the people and offering some compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9350)|
| 2:35:57| And the third thing was the traffic and Julie, you are correct, that's not a real good area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9357)|
| 2:36:09| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| I had asked Mr. Snowden this afternoon to be prepared to speak to everything that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| going on as far as Emory Road and improvements in that immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| This subdivision, to my understanding, will not be built for at least two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9383)|
| 2:36:30| probably even a little longer than that when it's all said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| So I was very curious about what that road, Emory Road, would look like as far as improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9395)|
| 2:36:43| that are scheduled to be made before this subdivision is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9403)|
| 2:36:48| So Jim, could you address that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| Yeah, I'll be glad to, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| We don't have any necessarily wholesale widening along West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| However, we do have a couple of projects that are in the segment, obviously the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| talked about previously, a harrow at Carpenter, and then also we're trying to work with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| about securing some safety funding for the intersection of Byington Beaver Ridge and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9431)|
| 2:37:19| West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| So those are the two projects that we have currently in the conversation along West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9440)|
| 2:37:27| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| And the intersection, which is so close to this proposed subdivision there, can you tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9448)|
| 2:37:37| me again your estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| And Julie, I hear what you're saying about nothing's been turned yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| And yeah, but having said all that, Jim, in your best estimate, what do you think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9463)|
| 2:37:51| looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| Yeah, since we have met last time, we actually have gave TDOT a good portion of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9473)|
| 2:38:00| for the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| So I know TDOT is moving forward with the right-of-way process, which oftentimes you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9481)|
| 2:38:07| may not see dirt moving, but that doesn't mean that there are things going on like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| negotiations and property sales and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| So the money has been transferred to TDOT, so I know the right-of-way process has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9493)|
| 2:38:20| That process probably is going to take, I mean, realistically, you know, nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| 12 months, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| So I mean, I think it's still within the realm of possibility to see construction start late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| next year or late 21 and finish up in 22 possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| So in a perfect world, that would coincide with about the time that this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| Julie, I'm just going by what we're being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| In a perfect world, then all of this would be coming to completion at about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9529)|
| 2:38:55| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| You know, I'm not thrilled to death about this, but I will have to say I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9536)|
| 2:39:03| that this represents the ultimate in compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| You know, the builder met with this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| You'll notice that those residents are not here tonight because, in fact, the huge concession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| about not going through Northampton Way, and that was huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| That was huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| And I absolutely agree with that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| I wouldn't have wanted that to happen anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| And so Smith Belt has agreed not to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| I have no problem, and I notice Mr. Biggs is going to speak, with requesting a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9572)|
| 2:39:39| postponement to be assured in writing from Mr. Smith that, in fact, if for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9579)|
| 2:39:49| the concept plan isn't approved, that, you know, that this would not go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9589)|
| 2:39:59| But, again, I'll defer to my colleague at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9599)|
| 2:40:04| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| I do remember us having a heated discussion, and Chairman Jay and myself were actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| in pretty in tune on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| I remember we both, he and I both separately spent countless hours out there, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9614)|
| 2:40:21| that I drove a lot of the property and went out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| But one of the things that I'm wanting to talk about is Commissioner Hill started to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| hit on something, but I want to talk about potential, because you just stated that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| not going to have any road improvements to that Emory Road area infrastructure-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| widening and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| But what about the potential other parcels within that mile, mile and a half area radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9642)|
| 2:40:49| that are going to come to Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| You know, some of these 100-acre, 300-acre farms that could have a negative impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| traffic flow as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| Have we looked out that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| Because that, becoming a bus stop right there by Blacks Ferry, when you come around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| blind curve and the opportunity for a child or someone to get hurt is very concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9668)|
| 2:41:08| But, again, we're talking about density, and since Commissioner Hill already has a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9668)|
| 2:41:16| deferral, is there any way that I could maybe get some data from you of talking about future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| things in that area that would also impact those blind curves and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| Does anybody else want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| I think everybody would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| If you have information about it, then, you know, we'd love to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9698)|
| 2:41:38| Commissioners, I'm going to go to Commissioner Durrett first, and then Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| Mr. Mullins, I think, if I remember correctly, I heard there has not been a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9703)|
| 2:41:50| Is there going to be one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| There will have to be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9712)|
| 2:41:53| You know, we're on the rezoning phase right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| You have a concept phase, and then there's a use-on-review, which is a separate application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| that'll go back before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| Oftentimes, those things coincide at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| You'll do your concept plan and use-on-review at the same time, so you only have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| through one Planning Commission application, one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| What Misfield did is they wanted to go ahead and get their concept plan with this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9734)|
| 2:42:20| of having the playground, having the common area and the amenities there at the stub-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9740)|
| 2:42:24| for Patriot Way approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| So they would show this concept plan will go forward, and then we'll go towards use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| and that's where you spend all the money doing the engineering and the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| And the concept plan can change because of that, but usually there are minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9756)|
| 2:42:42| There are more tweaks to it based upon what improvements need to be made to West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| how would that affect the lots on that frontage, what additional engineering or stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| needs to be done, change in those ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| So there's going to be two additional meetings through the Planning Commission with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| to this property because of the way we are proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| Law Director Sanders, if Commissioner Hill, since it's in her district, and to avoid a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9790)|
| 2:43:19| 30-day delay, could she just make a motion that says to approve this rezoning with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9799)|
| 2:43:28| condition that all access from this development be only on West Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9808)|
| 2:43:36| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| I feel like we're kind of wrapping up, but I did want to give you one other opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| I saw that you wanted to speak, if you wanted to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| Just a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Ms. Hill, you mentioned that the people from Northampton Commons is not here, nor is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9836)|
| 2:44:04| Smith, nor is Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| So this is their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| This is their $1.5 million deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| So I just wanted to clear the air with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| The other thing is, commercial property, they just went before the Zoning Board, correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9856)|
| 2:44:22| me if I am mistaken, and already have it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| Mr. Smith said if this did not go through, he'll just throw some rental townhouses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9866)|
| 2:44:32| it, and there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| There is not an operating business within this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9874)|
| 2:44:40| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| There is not an operating business within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| There's two residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| There's no commercial property right there, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| There are two residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9892)|
| 2:44:56| Mr. Snowden, from the previous conversation, and Mr. J., TDOT will not allow access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9896)|
| 2:45:06| So now, they're going to allow access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| So, on the 13th, let's see, Mr. Rainbolt wanted to ask if there has been an approval given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9910)|
| 2:45:26| for the entrance and exit to the address of 5913 West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9926)|
| 2:45:32| I called your office yesterday, left a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| I have not heard back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| He was so kind to respond the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| Julie, I did receive your message, and I will get back to you in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9938)|
| 2:45:42| On the 13th at 1224 p.m., at this time, there has not been any access given to West Emery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9942)|
| 2:45:50| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| So, now we're back to TDOT giving access to West Emery Road to keep them through the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9952)|
| 2:45:58| There was no concession made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Ms. Mullins, if you would like to tender me with the email that says something about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| playground from the neighbors, I'd greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9964)|
| 2:46:14| And from Mr. Jacobs' office, I pulled out right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| Anytime work is performed on or adjacent to any road in Knox County, safety will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9978)|
| 2:46:26| primary consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| Safety was a huge consideration when we denied it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9988)|
| 2:46:34| Mr. Biggs drove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| Mr. J drove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| Lots of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| Safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| I'm going to jump in here and address a few things that have been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I don't believe I ever said the piece of property was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| I think I said that the situation was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| My primary objection when this came up was safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| And Ms. McBee, you and I have had several conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| I have been to community meetings and we have been out there and we have been through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10020)|
| 2:47:04| lot of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| My primary concern was safety as it relates to Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| Our engineering team said that Northampton, although it may be a disruption to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10030)|
| 2:47:16| that Northampton Boulevard and Patriot Way were large enough roads to accommodate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10036)|
| 2:47:20| My major concern was if all of it went that way, it went to Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| And Carpenter Road is barely wide enough to fit my truck in the turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| And it was absolutely an opportunity where I could see that crashes and safety were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| to be a huge issue if all the cars went that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| So that was my primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| And in looking at this, I think stepping aside from some of the bigger issues, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10060)|
| 2:47:48| always going to be in play in growing Knox County, the residents of Northampton that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| I have all talked to had a couple of big concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| Don't come through my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| Go out on West Emory instead of through my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| And don't disrupt what our quality of life is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10082)|
| 2:48:06| And the applicant has done every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| Has said, we'll go out on Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| We'll improve the quality of life by creating a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| We won't go through your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| We'll go through your neighborhood and we'll accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| And I think that there's times people have a right to use their land and to develop their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10100)|
| 2:48:28| land, and there's a lot of concerns that we go through in greater, think about density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| And we all know that we need a lot more infrastructure improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| But I think this is a clear example where they've given everybody in Northampton pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| much everything they've wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| So I'm struggling to find a reason not to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| And I think that we can put conditions on there with the motion that says this is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| So there's no issue thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| So I just wanted to put that into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| I'd like to clarify a few things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| I never said anything about townhomes on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| I did say that there are three commercial lots that are currently zoned commercial that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| could have three separate businesses on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| I agree with Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| The issues that were before us last time around have all been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10161)|
| 2:49:27| If the law department says we can condition the zoning on only connection is to West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10167)|
| 2:49:35| Road and a deed restriction for a playground or a common space, I don't see why we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10175)|
| 2:49:47| go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| Mr. Mullins has said his client is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| But I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| I didn't say anything about townhomes on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| The property is already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| And while there's not commercial businesses there, it would be a fairly simple process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| for three commercial businesses to be started there since the property is already zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10203)|
| 2:50:09| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| I just have a question about if we approve this based on the condition that will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10213)|
| 2:50:17| be accessed to Patriot's Way, who will make sure that will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10217)|
| 2:50:23| Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| They would not, if I'm correct, they would not approve any concept plan or any process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| going further without, if that would not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| Because I'm just fearful that not saying anything about planning, that it will happen, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| it will be an oopsie and there's no way to mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| I also believe engineering would say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| Seeing no further discussion, I'll entertain a motion from Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10253)|
| 2:50:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| Again, I want to stress that there was a great deal of compromise in this, that the North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10261)|
| 2:51:07| Hampton residents were heard and they have been accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| I would like to make a motion that this application be accepted at four units per acre with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10271)|
| 2:51:23| deed restriction in place for the common area and the only entrance and exit being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10283)|
| 2:51:33| on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| Second by Commissioner Daley, first by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10307)|

| 2:51:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10311)|

| 2:51:55| Good luck with your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| And please, Ms. McBee, know that engineering, planning, and this commission will all be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| paying attention to how this is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10321)|

| 2:57:52| Yes, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| Who's going to be responsible for that culvert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| The taxpayer or the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| It would be Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| It's our culvert now, so obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| if there is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| which it looks like there may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| the county would be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| for that, so we'll look to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| what size that culvert needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| One thing I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| make aware of, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| upstream property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| may not like that, but that downstream property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| owner may like that culvert being undersized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10700)|
| 2:58:22| and that's a balance that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| work into because we don't want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| more water downstream on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| somebody, so we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| have to look at that, but it would be Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| Engineering that would replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| What's the size of a 100-year flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10714)|
| 2:58:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| I would have to look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| We'd have to look at the upstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| drainage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| and size it, but that is something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| will do as part of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| And we are requiring a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| Yeah, that would be part of our sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10736)|
| 2:58:58| I'm not pulling that. Maybe you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| or Amy. What's the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| that the taxpayer will have to fill in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| into their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10748)|
| 2:59:12| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| for general purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| I know that we had a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| out in the south that really worked with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| and they even donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| I think he's standing back there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10764)|
| 2:59:32| 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| And our sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| gym at Cherokee Landing was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| 900?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| I don't remember, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| I just want to know what that distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| was there and the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| We're probably looking at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| I think Cherokee Landing was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| 90,000 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| Something like that. So we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| at some dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| Commissioner Daley, can I ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| clarification on the subject matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| Sure. Are you saying 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| feet along the developer's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| or the gap that is filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| The gap looks like a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| Yeah, I'm asking for the gap. The difference from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| the end of the property to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| Ebenezer sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| What's that distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10820)|
| 3:00:30| Can we give Mr. Snowden some reading glasses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10830)|
| 3:00:36| Amy and I are looking at it. Looks like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| some sidewalk that actually extends north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| or, pardon me, west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| of Strawflower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| So it looks like there's only two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| that will need sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| It looks about 366 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10851)|
| 3:00:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| Commissioner Smith, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| Any further discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| We have a proper first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10863)|
| 3:01:09| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| Schoonmaker was the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| and Daley was the second, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| I went into discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| with Mr. Snowden about the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Oh, okay. I thought, why don't I have that written down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| there in the first and the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| Oh, I just have who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| spoke for first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| Okay, let's start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| I do have a Schoonmaker to Daley right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| It's just how I wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| I think Mr. Snowden wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| I looked at these pictures a little closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| and I think it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| if you look at the first picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| there's a lot of water impounded on the upstream side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| If you look at the second picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| there's very little water coming out of the pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| so it's highly possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| that the pipe just may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| clogged on the inlet end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| so it may just be routine maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| and it may not even be a size culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| but just something I noticed I want to make aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| you can notice the first picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| shows a lot of impoundment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| The second picture doesn't show water coming out the outlet end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| so it may be a clogged culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| so we'll check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| Our guys do an outstanding job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=10931)|

| 3:04:23| Sorry, I'm trying to pull my map up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| on my computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11065)|

| 3:04:33| It's fine, go ahead, sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| Our A is up to 3 dwellings per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| per acre, is that right Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11081)|
| 3:04:45| It's based on the lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| Based on the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| So we're at 4.6 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| 4.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| and there's a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| lot size of 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| as long as they have sanitary sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| Is there sewer there David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| Yes sir, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| So that could be 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| about 20 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| Our plans are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| to construct any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| additional public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| So they'll be running off of Johnson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| So we'll get 4 or 5 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| The minimum lot width at that point would be 75 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| So there'll be 4 or 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| 75 foot wide blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| And to get that you've got to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| a RA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| Correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| Thank you Chairman, sorry about that earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| This is right behind Amherst Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| if I'm correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| and I've had multiple phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| and complaints about that S-curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| that it looks like is right back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| Director Stodden, have we done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| or are we doing anything in front of this specific parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| What we plan on doing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| we're working with that landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| The road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| pretty decent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| coming from Ball Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| and Shod Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| until you really get to those hairpin curves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| It's essentially one lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| We're going to try to work with that landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| I think we've got enough right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| to kind of take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| from that sharp curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| to the other sharp curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| and actually create enough width for two-way traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| there, maybe about 18 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| That's something that my department is working on currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| And given the new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| that's right at the corner of Shod and Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| is this maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| future area for a red light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| There's a good possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| spacing-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| it would relate itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| good for a signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| We haven't actually received any request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| I know we did receive a request on it once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| and we've looked at it, but it didn't warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| Moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| with the connection to both Ball Camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| and Ball Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| I could see this being a spot for that potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| So with the road upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| and the possible signal, you feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| with the traffic that these would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| Yeah, based on what Mr. Harbin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| is proposing, we're comfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11230)|

| 3:17:47| about what we're going to put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11867)|
| 3:17:49| because our objective is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11869)|
| 3:17:51| we don't want to take action without their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11871)|

| 3:17:59| to take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| so would we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| that page out of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11883)|

| 3:18:11| that we have the ability to take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| because we can no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| put in their mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| requirement because we took that out of our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| happy to put in whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| language suits this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| so if you all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11905)|
| 3:18:28| to give us direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| on that, we encourage people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| obviously to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| because they wouldn't want action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| or other people to show up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| speak about a project and then not be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| to defend their own project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| we can draft something and share it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11924)|
| 3:18:46| with this body or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| appropriate person and you all can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11928)|
| 3:18:50| give us feedback or you can give us direction on what you'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11930)|
| 3:18:52| to have included in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| We probably need to discuss that because it's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| out in the package so we probably need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| figure that out before we leave here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| Or what we could do is if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| like to draft something, Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| could draft it and we could put it on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| and we could all make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| that we're on the same page on the forum and then they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| go ahead and send it out, you know, this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| Everybody just would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| need to participate in the forum which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| kind of rare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| I just wanted to make sure moving forward that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| since we already have a system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| where we put something in there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11964)|
| 3:19:26| attendance is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| that applicants know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| required but if you don't show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11972)|
| 3:19:34| we will withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| or take action on, I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| the second no-show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| So that's clear, so you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| send us some language and you can send it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| and I can work on putting it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| Is Mr. Davis close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| He said he was parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| Okay, are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| I would be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| I got a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| Follow up on Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| Daniel, did we totally do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| we did not totally do away with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12002)|
| 3:20:04| requirement to be here the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| If you'll read the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12008)|
| 3:20:10| it encourages everybody to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| applicants and those in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| the next step is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| if the applicant fails to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| the first time it's on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| it's moved to the back of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12022)|
| 3:20:24| and if they're not there when you come to the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| again then it goes to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12026)|
| 3:20:28| meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| and if they're not at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| then the application is deemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| unless commission votes otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| and if you vote otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12038)|
| 3:20:40| you're going to send them a notification of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12040)|
| 3:20:42| what's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| they'll know what happens going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12044)|
| 3:20:46| So we've not removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| the requirement to be here for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| meeting? No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| what do we need to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| I don't follow you Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12056)|
| 3:20:58| What do we need to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| Well he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| contemplates that I believe Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12062)|
| 3:21:04| This is what the caption said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| Consideration of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12066)|
| 3:21:08| of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| amending the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12070)|
| 3:21:12| rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12072)|

| 3:21:18| for Action to Strongly Encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| and Not Require Attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| at Zoning Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| by the Applicant or Representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12084)|
| 3:21:30| Daniel, did that take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| it away? No, the caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| the caption's not controlling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| here, it's going to be the language of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Did you read that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| Daniel was the one that wrote it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| so I'm pretty sure he read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12104)|
| 3:21:48| I wrote the language of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| If that is the case, then yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| we need to correct that. They are required to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| here for the first time. If they don't show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| and we'll send them the letter or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| they don't show up the second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| like in the case, that case we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| then we can either make a motion to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| or even make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| to move it to a third month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| if we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| And the question I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| from Commissioner Smith is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| what you put on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12136)|
| 3:22:18| NPC notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12138)|
| 3:22:20| I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| it's also not controlling what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12142)|
| 3:22:24| NPC puts in its packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| In the rule that we changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| we struck the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| Attendance at the Zoning Session by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| Applicant or Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| for a rezoning or planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| shall be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| for commission action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12158)|
| 3:22:44| Commissioner Bussard, do you want to weigh it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12164)|
| 3:22:46| I'm not sure who was first here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12166)|
| 3:22:48| I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| the way it was originally read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| Mr. Smith, I think you read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| we do not require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12176)|
| 3:22:58| we strongly suggest but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| don't require you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12180)|
| 3:23:02| to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12182)|
| 3:23:04| Does that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12184)|
| 3:23:08| To me that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| I don't have to be here so it should go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12190)|
| 3:23:12| through anyway if it's on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| and not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| if that's what we're going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| what's on there now, what you just read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| The problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| is if you have somebody comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| and objects to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| then we've got to put it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| to the next month, it seems like we're just going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| filling up our calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| with what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| I'm just throwing that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12214)|
| 3:23:36| Mr. Wheeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| Thank you, Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| It seems like the reason behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12220)|
| 3:23:42| was so commission's hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| would not be tied anymore when an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| didn't show up, especially if there was a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| opposition that showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| I don't know that for the applicant's benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| I don't know that anything needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| changed, for their benefit they should be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| I don't know that the packet necessarily needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12238)|
| 3:24:01| changed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| the point was for our own benefit to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| to act in case they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| show up and there would be no automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| I just think we need to put this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| Rule 7 Section F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| in with the packet that goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| to them so that they can read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| and realize that if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| show up at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| we can take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| So Ms. Brooks, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| What I'm hearing is if you would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| the rule that has been changed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| figure out how to incorporate that into some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| and send it back to us for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| Yes, I can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| Ms. Brooks, don't you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| at the end of every filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| it says action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| by county commission will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| on, you know, Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| November 16th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| or final action or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| So, I mean, why do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| That's notification enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| that they need to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| but if they're not here, we're going to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| decide what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| regardless, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| My understanding is in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| there has been where someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| didn't show up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| it was a previous director, I believe it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| Director Green, who had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| staff start sticking, I think we stick like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| bright yellow and we email it to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| or perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| we email it as well now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| a separate notice says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| you should show up or you shall show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12327)|
| 3:25:31| Just an extra step that we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| in the process to notify people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| I'm going to move on if I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| see any other lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| Before we get to Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| had items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| in one item his name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| spelled one way and one item is spelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| the other way, so let's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| line that up for the next one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| One was a green with an E and one is green without an E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| unless I hear objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| items 52 and 53 will be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| to December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| and Ms. Brooks, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| reach out to the applicant and tell him it has been moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| back 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12369)|

| 3:26:15| Drew, you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12375)|

| 3:26:25| Do we need to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=12389)|
