| 2:26:34| what can we do as a community to go into there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| and give them information to where they can live their lives in some sort of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| that they're not going to catch this virus and die the next day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| And I'm talking about some of our senior citizens because some of them have been gone outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| Are we going to wear a mask outside in the sunshine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| Unfortunately, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| we can't reassure anybody in Knox County that they won't get COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| COVID-19 is now community-wide, and anywhere you go, there's a risk that you'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8824)|
| 2:27:11| And one really important resource I forgot to bring up is their doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| their family doctor, their private doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| Give them a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Ask them questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| They know your medical history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| They know your risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8840)|
| 2:27:21| They know you better than I do because I don't see you as a patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| so they have more information about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| And they're a great resource for information and how to protect yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| and what you should and shouldn't do, and they'll provide you with some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| I just visited with a doctor today and got some of this information from the doctor there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8854)|
| 2:27:42| and they were more positive that we could deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| in saying we can't guarantee that you're not going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| And I don't want that guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| I just want not a guarantee but a feeling that we can deal with it without being negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| The what is 18 to 24 because we shut things down, that people are not in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8877)|
| 2:28:02| you know, the suicide rates have gone up, and all this other stuff affects you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| And my question was to the doctor is I got this mask up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| and I'm breathing in more carbon dioxide than I have ever in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| and you can hear my grumbly voice come in here because I've had a diverticulum removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| and it makes me to where sometimes I can't even talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| It sounds like I'm just growling at people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| But all those things right there, is there any way that we can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8905)|
| 2:28:29| hey, we're going to get through this, but we're going to have to deal with it from now on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| but we're positive that we can handle it if you do, you know, the five things that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| I'm sorry, Mr. President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| I believe we've been saying that, but perhaps we haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| and you and I maybe can have an offline conversation about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| because I believe that has been our message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| We can get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| I've even said it's going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| It's going to be different, but it's going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| And COVID-19, like the flu virus, once upon a time the flu virus was novel like COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| The flu virus is still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| COVID-19 in a version will still be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| We'll hopefully have a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| You may have to get a COVID-19 vaccine every year like you get a flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| We don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| So it's going to be like a lot of other viruses that we get, and we get vaccines for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| There are different ones that we all get vaccines for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| There are meningitis viruses and things that we get vaccines for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| and it will just become part of our routine vaccinations that we all have to get or should get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8972)|
| 2:29:38| They don't have to get them, should get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| But okay, this is the last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| I'm not going to say anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8982)|
| 2:29:43| I'm not going to ask you another question, but go back to this one thing that I said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| In my district, I don't know what it is, but they are not getting your message that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| hey, we're going to deal with this, we're going to get through with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| I'm reassuring them on that fact and getting this information from different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| But then we get these other things that are on the Internet more and more and more about issues about COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9002)|
| 2:30:11| To me, it looks good, what I want to hear, but it's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9011)|
| 2:30:16| And we've got to go back and make sure that what you're seeing on the Internet is not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| and you don't have to believe what's on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| Just go with what we've said here, what you have to do, the five things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| And I don't know how we're going to do it, how we're going to put it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| what we're going to have to do to advertise this to some of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| but they want to hear what they want to hear, not what they have to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| And that's all I was trying to get across here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| every time that we see people, we give them this positive attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| We may get it, we may not get it, but we've got to live our lives like we can at the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9046)|
| 2:30:53| And that's all I was asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| What can we do to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| You've explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| I appreciate you coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Just a comment on your resources, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| I would really recommend you stick with the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| CDC or World Health Organization as a resource for information on the COVID virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9069)|
| 2:31:15| or like the American Medical Association and other reliable groups like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| I'm going to recognize just a couple other lights, Dr. B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| But the one thing I'll weigh in on this is I think all of us as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| and when I think of a wonderful community advocate, I think of Vivian and her passion for the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9086)|
| 2:31:34| And in a way, if there's one thing I could say for all of us and all the leaders in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| wouldn't it be great if we all could be Vivians for just doing the five things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9100)|
| 2:31:45| I don't know that you can wave a magic wand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| People are still going to just try to do their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| But if we could just try to be Vivians about doing those five things, I mean, that's my common sense approach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| So with that said, I'm going to recognize Commissioner Biggs, your light has been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| And then I know Commissioner Jay did the hand light just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9122)|
| 2:32:06| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| Dr. Buchanan, I've got a couple quick questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| Number one, I'm looking for the data that shows about the false positives because I've had multiple e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9130)|
| 2:32:17| and I don't have that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| So if you could do me a favor and just e-mail me the link, because I've looked on your website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| and I couldn't find it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Yeah, you're not going to find it on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| Well, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| I actually probably have to get it from our hospital partners just because that's in conversation who I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9149)|
| 2:32:34| But I'm happy to send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| And also, where would I find other illnesses and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| I've had people call me about the nutrition of children in specific districts throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9161)|
| 2:32:47| and things of that nature that are being impacted by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Is there somewhere that I could direct them to, like a chart almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| where we could look at something on the school site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| Because I was going to ask the school people, but they left already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| I apologize, but I'm not sure what you're asking me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| So, okay, you know the backpack program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| You know how they're being able to pick up food and things of that nature at different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| So one of the things is some of the parents that I got an e-mail from, or I could forward it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9189)|
| 2:33:15| whenever we delayed school an additional specific amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| they're worried about the nutrition of their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| Is there a website or some data that we can give to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9201)|
| 2:33:26| A couple of websites that come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| The American Academy of Pediatrics has information on growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Like children falling behind in their weight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Yeah, just not getting to eat adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| The Academy of Pediatrics is one site, and then I'll have to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| It's Bright Darts, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| An early prevention and detection website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| You can throw that to me in the e-mail, too, if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| I'll need to make myself a note before I leave, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9242)|
| 2:34:03| First off, Dr. Buchanan, I just want to say thank you for your hard work and your team's hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9243)|
| 2:34:09| I think so often our community forgets that here we are at August 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9249)|
| 2:34:17| and you all have been on pretty much full-time seven days a week since March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| without a break, without a complaint, without anything else but to focus on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| when you have a lot of other public health issues on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| Can you just tell us sort of how many, I mean, just approximate how many professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| medical physicians, experts in infectious control, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| you have on your team that are focused on this every single day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| On my core epi team, I have right now about 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| Probably out of that number, I would guess 50% of those are some type of professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9295)|
| 2:35:02| either public health professional or medical professional, maybe more, maybe 75% nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| epidemiologists, nurse practitioners, all of whom are focusing on addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9308)|
| 2:35:15| And so then we expand that across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| There are 95 counties, and each of those 95 counties has a health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9318)|
| 2:35:22| Each of those health departments do have staff focusing only on COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9322)|
| 2:35:27| All of us are still in what we call our Continuity of Operations Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| That means we've reduced our usual services so that everybody can focus on COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9330)|
| 2:35:37| And we anticipate doing that for at least until the end of this calendar year, if not longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9337)|
| 2:35:42| Is it fair to say that that team that you have, in addition to those other teams across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9342)|
| 2:35:50| are constantly looking at the data, the medical advice, the papers, the studies, the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9350)|
| 2:35:59| as science continues to learn more about it, it changes, it's constantly being reported upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9359)|
| 2:36:06| and they're on the front edge of that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| We have two calls a week with the state of Tennessee, and they have, I think they still have daily calls with the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| I'm not sure how often their calls with the CDC are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| In addition to that, we have an entire team of people who are dedicated to coming through the literature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9380)|
| 2:36:26| coming through the recommendations, making sure that we're staying up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| so that we can give our citizens the most up-to-date recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| and we can follow those up-to-date recommendations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| And how are you relaying all that information comprehensively to the people of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9395)|
| 2:36:42| Our primary website, social media, those are two of our big ways of putting information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9402)|
| 2:36:48| Our press briefings, those are taped, and people can watch them anytime they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9408)|
| 2:36:54| And then in addition to that, we have our 865-215-5555 number that's operated Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9414)|
| 2:37:03| I think it's 8 to 430 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| So we try to use a variety of different communication mechanisms to get information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| We realize some people have limited access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| Most people do have a phone, and they can call and ask us questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| and thank goodness people are calling and asking us questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| And if resources and time allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| would representatives from your team be also willing to maybe go out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| and meet with community groups or other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| I know time and resources are limited, but, you know, as it's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| those are things that you do often, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| Actually, my team is going to be upset with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| I did forget we've also done a whole series of educational videos, specifically in different languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9460)|
| 2:37:47| We've done them in English, but we've also done them in other languages like Spanish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| and some others that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| We know we have groups in Knoxville that live here, or groups in Knoxville that speak those languages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| and putting those out in ways that we've been told by people who work with those communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| ways they consume information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| So getting it out there in a place where people can use it in a way that is user-friendly for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| because we know we need to put it out there in a way that people are used to consuming it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| And, yes, if time permitted, we would do more public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| We actually do public speaking regularly, but not doing a lot of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| Commissioner Bussard, final word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| The positive information that we should be talking about right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| is things that you have gotten from your website right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| I can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| This page right here, I know you can't see it, but it's the one that Biggs was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9530)|
| 2:38:57| But it has on this back page down here, it shows the use of ventilators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| It shows the hospitalization and the active cases going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9542)|
| 2:39:08| One of the most important things that I see here is the use of ventilators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| It has gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| The cases have gone up a little bit, and also the ICU cases are at a very low rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9554)|
| 2:39:21| That is some positive information that the people in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| even though the cases are reporting in there, we're not having them in the hospital as serious cases now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9564)|
| 2:39:32| And, like I said, if you get that out, that gives some sort of hope to the people out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| not just what you're talking about here, but this little chart right here that you're seeing right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9576)|
| 2:39:41| goes up to July the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| So every Thursday at 1230, we update those things that are called the benchmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9585)|
| 2:39:52| and we talk about how they're trending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Are they getting better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| Are they getting worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9595)|
| 2:39:56| We talk about what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| So tune in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Every station carries it every day at 1230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| Or I think that community TV is also carrying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| What stations is that that you put out to the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| Is it all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| I'm not watching TV because I'm speaking, so I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| But that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| They can tune in at 1230 and see that, and I think they're archived as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| but that would require Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| But we talk about those and talk about which direction they're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| and are they getting better or getting worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| What does that mean to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Now the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| I think we're at 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9645)|

| 2:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| We have a motion to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| A second from Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| and the Chair recognizes Mr. Hare from the Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| Brian Hare, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| Before I speak to this, I do want to acknowledge one thing the Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| and I spoke of earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| In the month of August on the 16th day, 1974, a miraculous event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| No, nothing that you're probably aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| but it was the day that Jim Snowden was brought into this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| So we want to wish Mr. Snowden a very happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| Not to embarrass him, and I chose not to oblige.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| He'll probably play a Van Halen birthday song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| I wanted to speak to this just for a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| This is something that we definitely don't want to be here addressing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| but this is kind of the boat that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| In 2007, Knox County leased this property to the Smoky Mountain Athletic Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| It was 20 acres of land for $1 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| Of course, this was nothing this current commission did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| and there's numerous leases like this across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| You can look at them as fair, unfair, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| but it's just the hand that we've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| We want moving forward for all leases to be mutually beneficial to both the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| and the individuals that are renting the property from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| On this particular piece of property, the Smoky Mountain Athletic Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9753)|
| 2:42:38| we tried to renegotiate prior to being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| What we're trying to accomplish is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| We want the constituents to have the ability to go onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| However, when it is not in use by this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| they have padlocked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| Our people are not allowed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| This has been addressed, and they refer to it as their property, which is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| So that being said, all we have tried to do is go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9782)|
| 2:43:06| renegotiate the remaining seven years of this property on the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| and we're asking for $5,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| and that is something that has been done with all other organizations in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| for exclusivity rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| In addition to that, we are wanting the park to be open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| when it is not in use by the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| Granted, Smoky Mountain Athletic Club has put several hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| into this property, made significant improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| and we're very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| So their main question is what happens if the property is damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| or something happens when it is in use by someone other than that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| Knox County will assume liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Parks and Recreation will repair the property in the event something happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| so that's a non-issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| So essentially, we tried to negotiate that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| They refused to make any arrangements with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| So in this contract, there is a termination for convenience clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| and this is available to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| It was in there when it was signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| So we're here tonight as the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| and we are exercising our right to terminate this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| We will bring this contract back next month for approval with new terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9853)|
| 2:44:20| But before we're able to do that, again, because they did not negotiate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9860)|
| 2:44:25| we had to terminate the current contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| and we worked very closely with the law director's office to make this a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9867)|
| 2:44:33| Some of the things that this organization has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| that's caused us to get to this point outside of locking out constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| they've illegally subleased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| They subleased to the Knoxville Flag Football League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| excuse me, I'm thinking about fantasy football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| They subleased to the KFFL for $4,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| They subleased to UT Rugby for $6,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| and then they have another rugby organization that's paying just under $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| So all of this, and they're doing it off of the backs of taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| for $20 over 20 years, and we're just wanting to get it leveled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9905)|
| 2:45:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| Commissioner Andrews, do you have a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| I spoke with Chief O'Brien here this morning or this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9915)|
| 2:45:18| and I mean, I share his sentiments about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| I'll be able to start my conversation, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| I'll tell you, in 2007, I would have told you this was a bad lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| and it's a terrible lease for the county, but we were in it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| And so I just think that I'd like to see some of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9931)|
| 2:45:37| or the – not that I don't believe you at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| because I trust what you say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| But I'd like to see some – how do we know that they've leased it to UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| and how do we know that they've leased it to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| I'd like – if you could provide that to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| I mean, I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| I just – if you could provide that to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| I'd be a lot easier voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| And only because of the fact we need to honor our contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9957)|
| 2:46:02| if there's nothing wrong with – if they followed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9962)|
| 2:46:07| But if they haven't followed through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| and I'd like to see evidence where we've tried to make contact with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| via letter or email or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| I just want to be sure, because we have a contract with them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| and I mean, I think it's a terrible lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| but I also think if we're subjected to fulfill it, I think we should fulfill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9982)|
| 2:46:28| And so –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| We'll scan this in and send it out to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| This is all of the correspondence that we've had with them over the last 16 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| regarding this particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| in addition to some of their financials that does show the receipt of the sub-lease payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| Yeah, if you can just show me a couple sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| I don't need to see everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10006)|
| 2:46:47| I just want to see some evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| I mean, I just – I don't want to blindly, as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| vote to terminate contracts because we want to terminate a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| I think that would be a bad measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| Is there a non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| I mean, do they have a 990 that can be accessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| We have not received audited financials from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| They are only providing the self-provided component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| Our contracts do not require the receipt of audited financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10027)|
| 2:47:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| Commissioner Daley, and then – sorry, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Brian, you said you were going to come back next month with a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| Is that with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| Well, we hope it's with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| This organization does a lot with that particular community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| but in order for us to be able to negotiate the remainder of a fair contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| we had to bring this termination this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| That way we can negotiate new terms and bring it back to commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| Would those terms be that they can't sublet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| They can sublet, but it has to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| and be approved by Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| It can't be done without Knox County's consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| We had the same problem a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| A couple years back, Charlie found out one guy was making $40,000 a year off of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10077)|
| 2:48:04| you know, parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| I think that got taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| I had one more question and my mind went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| So if I think of it, I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| Commissioner, I may have misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| Hey, Houston, will you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10102)|
| 2:48:23| Where is this property exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10103)|
| 2:48:24| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| It's across from the senior center on Oak Ridge Highway in the ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10106)|
| 2:48:30| It's the opposite side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| Permission to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| And by the way, I recognize Commissioner Jay, Schoonmaker, and Gil have all chimed in with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| Houston Havasea, Warner Main Avenue, Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10122)|
| 2:48:46| The current lease, Commissioner, does not provide for subleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| and that's one of the things that they are violating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| The new one, that's where we misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| The current lease does not prevent subleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| The future lease is anticipated that one of the terms of the changes that will provide them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10142)|
| 2:49:07| as long as it's done through parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| The other two terms that were materially different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10149)|
| 2:49:13| the other two terms that were materially different was to provide for a $5,000 a year change for the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10153)|
| 2:49:20| as well as not padlocking the park while they're not using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| They'll have exclusivity rights to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| And when they're not using it, they can't padlock it so the public can come in and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10167)|
| 2:49:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10173)|
| 2:49:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10174)|
| 2:49:35| Commissioner Jay, then we'll go Jay, Schoonmaker, and Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| I think my question was answered, but I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| This club, for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| has been currently subleasing it to other people for compensation illegally or against the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| Correct, against the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| I'm hoping that the lease that you're going to bring us next month will not have a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10197)|
| 2:50:06| It will be the remaining seven years of the current contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| That's what we're trying to renegotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| So they've been in effect since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| So they've served 13 years of that agreement the county has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10216)|
| 2:50:19| and we're willing to honor the remaining seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| We just want the terms to be level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| In future contracts with other entities like this, can we just not do a maximum of five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| I mean, how did we ever get into 20-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| I mean, that's—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| I can't speak for—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10234)|
| 2:50:35| I know because nobody was here, but that's just ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10237)|
| 2:50:38| To tie up county assets for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| Makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| That was part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| And could you tell me how many more of these we have throughout the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| There's several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| I'll call on Troy Fleming, who can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| And are we doing the same process across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10259)|
| 2:51:04| and not just simply singling out the contractual agreement we have with these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10270)|
| 2:51:11| Troy Fleming, 2447 Southern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| We are doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| We have our soccer organization, which was on there for one of the points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| is with the AYSOs who will have the same type of agreement that's kind of been going on as exclusivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| And like Brian said, we wanted to make it level across the county for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| as well as the people looking for soccer fields to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| And are we going to change or do they have a long-term agreement as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| And are we going to, as we have a new contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| limit the number of years in the existing contracts that we're just going to honor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10299)|
| 2:51:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10305)|
| 2:51:46| We're going to, excuse me for speaking over you, they're going to be, the AYSOs are year-to-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| And it's going to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| So we come back every year and we talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| And if there's things they want to change about it, then we can negotiate that at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| But we don't want to have the county assets tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| Is it the same amount of money or is it different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| No, it's the same across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10328)|
| 2:52:11| Be careful not to box yourselves in on the terms of these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| because every one of these lease agreements can be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| depending upon the amount of capital improvement that someone's going to put into that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10339)|
| 2:52:25| You might not get somebody willing to come in if you only give them three, five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| and they're going to spend $300,000 worth of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10349)|
| 2:52:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10357)|
| 2:52:38| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10359)|
| 2:52:40| My other question is, if they're using the taxpayer's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10360)|
| 2:52:46| that we bought the property, you know, for the taxpayer's use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| and they use it to buy equipment to service it, like mow it and like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10371)|
| 2:52:57| for that particular, does that still belong to the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| or does that have to be bought and donated to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10381)|
| 2:53:05| I would defer back to Houston for the law department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10385)|
| 2:53:12| Houston Avenue, C-400 Main Avenue, Norris County Law Department Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| That's an interesting question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10395)|
| 2:53:17| There are 501c3 nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10397)|
| 2:53:20| So when they purchase property, it belongs to that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10400)|
| 2:53:26| much like a normal business entity does, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| However, there's a provision, having a hard time off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10409)|
| 2:53:34| when those organizations wind down, the property has to be disposed of in a particular manner and way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10414)|
| 2:53:41| I think it has to be distributed to other nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| It can't just be divvied out or given to their board members or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10425)|
| 2:53:51| if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| So if they bought that property to take care of that lease that they've got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10433)|
| 2:54:03| like the mowers or trimmers or whatever else that they use there, belongs to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10443)|
| 2:54:11| When they leave it, does it go with them or does it stay there at that one particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10451)|
| 2:54:16| I see your point, and not unless the lease said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| It would belong to the nonprofit, and they would take it and do with it what they could legally do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| It would not stay with the property, unless the lease provided for otherwise, which could be done, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10466)|
| 2:54:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| So what I'm hearing from you is that if the nonprofit decides to buy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| and then they go away from the lease that they bought from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10479)|
| 2:54:44| that property has to stay with the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| It cannot be given to an individual, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| Are we referring to the mowers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10491)|
| 2:54:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| It would have to go to other nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| Although a mower, just chiming in here, a mower would be an expense item probably for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| I guess the real question would be if they did any leasehold improvements on the property or capital things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| If you've got a capital or a leasehold improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| I would expect that that would attach to the property and revert back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10517)|
| 2:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| And as we close this discussion, I know that the motion on the floor is to send this forward with no recommendation, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| I get why this one is somewhat sensitive because at least I heard about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| and I think the negotiation first started, I did hear from one person from that group about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| I mean, this was over a year ago, and they have put in a ton of money in this, so I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| This one is an emotional issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10538)|
| 2:55:41| So anyhow, back to you to close, Mr. Herr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| Not unless there's any other comments, I think we've said everything we need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10545)|
| 2:55:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10551)|
| 2:55:52| The motion before us is to send this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10556)|
| 2:55:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| What I might do, this was actually on the forum before we move on to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| This kind of tags in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| Mr. White, when I post on forum, I mean, we've been doing this with a whole lot of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10564)|
| 2:56:08| and this was more in response to item number 50, although some of these items were pulled after I posted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| I mean, this is one that we've kind of looked at separately, but, I mean, overall, there have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| this has been going on throughout with a lot of other organizations, a lot of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| I mean, how has that gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| And, you know, just in two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| Paul White, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| As Mr. Fleming said earlier, that we are trying to have a standard user agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10590)|
| 2:56:36| which is for most of the organizations, and with a lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10596)|
| 2:56:43| when there's been a lease agreement prior or, as Mr. Fleming stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| the lease agreements tend to have more exclusivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| and the user agreements tend to be more for sharing with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10610)|
| 2:56:59| Our local communities will do recreation programs and things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| So that's kind of the difference, and you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| We've been working on this almost, I think, 16 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| Mayor Jacobs' office asked us to kind of clean some of this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| and have everything be a lot more standardized and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10635)|
| 2:57:20| And as Chief Harris said several times, we want it to be mutually beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| So that's where we're at in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| I do want to commend our recreation department for trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| and doing everything they can to make this equitable and fair across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10654)|
| 2:57:40| Well, speaking personally, you guys are doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| You cleaned up a lot and are doing a really good job, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| Item number 52 is a resolution approving a contract in the amount not to exceed $99,433| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10671)|
| 2:58:00| with the Knoxville Football Officials Association for providing officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| to the Knox County Parks and Recreation Department's Youth Football League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| 2020 season resolution 705.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders, with a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| And Mr. Fleming, go ahead and step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| And I've seen a question from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10701)|
| 2:58:25| But I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| Commissioner Smith, recognize you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| And I know Mr. Fleming is already ready to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10712)|
| 2:58:33| Hey, Troy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10713)|
| 2:58:34| Reading through this contract, I just want to make sure I see where it's an up-front pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| in September with a review for any unused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| Does that unused include cancellation if something were to happen where, because of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10722)|
| 2:58:49| the season got cut in half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| At the end of every year, whatever games that weren't played and events didn't take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10733)|
| 2:58:59| the KFOA returns the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| Last year they returned, I think, between maybe $30,000 to $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| It's difficult to determine the exact amount of games just due to the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| And so when the games are postponed or not rescheduled, then we do our tracking system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| between the KFOA and our sports operation managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| They track those to know how many games are being played, how much money has been spent that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10758)|
| 2:59:23| And then at the end of the season, we sit down and Mr. Howard Russell returns a check to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10768)|
| 2:59:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10769)|
| 2:59:30| And I want to thank you for all the hard work I know you've been putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| Any other questions for Mr. Fleming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10776)|
| 2:59:37| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10777)|
| 2:59:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10779)|
| 2:59:40| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10780)|
| 2:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10781)|
| 2:59:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10783)|
| 2:59:44| Item number 53 is approving a professional services contract with Earnest and Young LLP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10784)|
| 2:59:48| for the provision of federal cost recovery services, Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10788)|
| 2:59:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| I know this came to us from purchasing, but I also know that in a way it kind of overlaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| with the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| As I understand this one, it was related to having Earnest and Young kind of help us make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| sure we don't leave any money on the table on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| When I read through the contract, I also saw that there were some outcomes that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| looking for for creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| When I posted to the forum, I really kind of wanted to get an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| As we move forward with this contract, will there be kind of a process for reporting back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| on our progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| I mean, my assumption is we'll occasionally have to approve things to accept monies, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10830)|
| 3:00:35| Mr. Caldwell, if you could kind of tease that out a little bit more, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10839)|
| 3:00:40| So this contract replaces the one that you all approved a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10840)|
| 3:00:44| We had to put it up for a competitive bid, and EY was the one that RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10844)|
| 3:00:53| What they do for us is fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| Anytime that we have questions over allowable expenses, we send them to them, and they direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10856)|
| 3:01:02| us in a way as to what we should reimburse for, what bucket it should go into, what type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10862)|
| 3:01:10| of documentation that we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| And so ultimately, that's their function is to help the accountant that we have who oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10873)|
| 3:01:22| this process for us, Susan Corlew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10882)|
| 3:01:25| So we just send documentation and questions into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| They give us their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| And then the good part is this is really more for FEMA grants, but we can utilize them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=10890)|

| 3:06:53| So, anyway, I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| We moved here from California six years ago, born and raised, spent 50 years of our life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11216)|
| 3:07:01| over there in California, my husband and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| We saw the change of our state with the government restrictions and the overreach, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11224)|
| 3:07:09| moved to beautiful East Tennessee, where it's been great up until recently with this COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11229)|
| 3:07:16| I now sell real estate here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| I can tell you that I get calls every week from Californians trying to get out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11239)|
| 3:07:25| state because of the mandates and the laws and the overreach of that government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11245)|
| 3:07:31| Now they're moving to Knoxville and they're slightly concerned, actually very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11251)|
| 3:07:36| about the health officials here that are passing these mask mandate laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11256)|
| 3:07:40| I appreciate Dr. Buchanan's speech that she gave and all the facts with the doctors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11260)|
| 3:07:46| that you, you know, had her point out that she had 100 doctors all on teams here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11266)|
| 3:07:51| trying to, you know, do what's best for us, but there is a 99% or around 99% survival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11271)|

| 3:08:04| life without restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| The scariest thing to me was that that health board almost passed a mandate restricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11286)|
| 3:08:12| the number of people in our own private homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| That should be shocking to everybody that the government would say who can, who you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11295)|
| 3:08:20| can have in your house or who you cannot have in your house and how many people you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11300)|

| 3:08:24| It's scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11304)|
| 3:08:25| I am now getting calls from clients and people that want to move out of Knox County because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11305)|
| 3:08:30| of these restrictions that the health board has put on us to Loudoun County and Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| County where there's less restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| So this is a concern of ours and I hope you are listening to people and it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11317)|
| 3:08:44| I was a registered nurse in California, by the way, that Dr. Buchanan doesn't talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11324)|
| 3:08:51| the survival rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| She doesn't talk about herd immunity at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| She is all about the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11335)|
| 3:09:01| So anyway, that is all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| I hope you consider actually removing that health board and starting new and fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11345)|
| 3:09:10| I know Mayor Jacobs voted against the health mandate and I thank him for that and whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11350)|
| 3:09:16| else stood on not infringing on our rights as citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11356)|

| 3:09:28| Would you speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11368)|

| 3:10:04| tell us what, or help instruct us on the laws of the land, not appointed officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11404)|
| 3:10:09| I'm going to leave this with the committee and I'll pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11409)|

| 3:10:52| Instead, our county's leaders have hyper-focused on a mandatory masking measure that simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11452)|
| 3:10:58| doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11458)|

| 3:13:44| I was just looking for people's schedules, if you want to give them at least two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| notice before a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11629)|
| 3:13:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11630)|
| 3:13:51| I mean, is there any preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| I mean, the folks are going to still be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| What time do you all want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| I took the liberty of talking to the incoming, and I think at the orientation, well, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11636)|
| 3:14:04| going to be after our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11644)|
| 3:14:05| No, it's before our meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11645)|
| 3:14:06| That's Wednesday and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11646)|
| 3:14:07| I think that would be a good time to get their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| I know that Dasha is graduating CAC, and they're having a virtual lunching at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11650)|
| 3:14:18| So I don't think she would be able to make a one o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11658)|
| 3:14:23| I know that Courtney has school-age children that she has to pick up at 2.45, so that pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11663)|
| 3:14:33| much kills one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11673)|
| 3:14:37| Terry and Kyle were pretty flexible to any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11677)|
| 3:14:41| So I'm wondering if maybe we need to think about five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| But it also depends on what the sitting commissioners have planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11686)|
| 3:14:51| I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11691)|
| 3:14:52| By the way, Brad has pledged to come back in October and heckle us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11692)|
| 3:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11698)|
| 3:14:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| Just my question is, are all the lights that are on right now related to this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11700)|
| 3:15:03| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11703)|
| 3:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11704)|

| 3:15:16| 1,600 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11716)|

| 3:15:21| I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| That wasn't voted on, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11722)|
| 3:15:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11723)|
| 3:15:24| Four o'clock it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| Four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| Four o'clock it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11726)|
| 3:15:27| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11727)|
| 3:15:28| We're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11728)|
| 3:15:29| 1,600 hours on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11729)|
| 3:15:30| And I'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11730)|
| 3:15:31| Do you want to vote or just agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11732)|

| 3:15:40| Drusilla, you got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11740)|
| 3:15:41| 1,600 on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11741)|
| 3:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11742)|
| 3:15:43| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11743)|
| 3:15:44| Announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11745)|
| 3:15:46| I'd like to make an announcement that everybody knows Pete and Linda Clausen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11746)|
| 3:15:55| Ms. Linda passed away the day before yesterday, I believe it was yesterday or the day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11755)|
| 3:16:00| so please keep Clausen's in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11760)|
| 3:16:04| They lost their daughter over a year ago, so, you know, I see that the Clausen's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11764)|
| 3:16:11| hard and they're a great community, and they live in South Knoxville, so they're a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11771)|
| 3:16:15| community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| So, keep those in your prayers, if you will, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11776)|
| 3:16:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| I think we've heard a lot of discussion about the health board, and I was going to ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| law director to kind of come back next week with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| I mean, because if you removed all the members for cause, you would not have a quorum nor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11789)|
| 3:16:35| a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11795)|
| 3:16:36| You would have two voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| So the mechanics of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| You know, if you don't mind to talk about it next week, the mechanics of that and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| it would entail, because at that point, we would go to the state mandates if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11803)|
| 3:16:47| have an active health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| So then you're listening to the governor tell us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| So just the mechanics of that, if that were to occur from this commission, how that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11811)|
| 3:16:57| look moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11817)|
| 3:16:58| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11818)|
| 3:17:01| I will be referring to David Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11821)|
| 3:17:05| He's been representing the health board and sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11825)|
| 3:17:08| He knows that law inside and out, so he'll give you whatever answer you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11828)|
| 3:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11832)|
| 3:17:13| I would ask Dr. Sanders to come prepared to talk about it, because we're getting emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| on both sides of it by the hundreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| And so there is a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| The mechanism is not as simple as being stated in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| It is not, Mr. Anders, and I'll be glad to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| I'm ready to speak about it tonight, but given the hour, I'm certainly glad to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| next week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=11856)|
