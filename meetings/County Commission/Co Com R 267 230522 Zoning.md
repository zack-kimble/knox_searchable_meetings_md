|     566 |   567 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=566.0)  |
|     567 |   570 | Mr. Snowden, do you want to weigh in first?                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=567.0)  |
|     570 |   576 | Yeah, that same information was provided to the planning commissioners, if I'm not mistaken,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=570.0)  |
|     576 |   579 | from the town planner, Mark Shipley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=576.0)  |
|     579 |   586 | And our sidewalk ordinance, the town had previously required a developer to install pedestrian                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=579.0)  |
|     586 |   592 | facilities down Fred's Road really to this property.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=586.0)  |
|     592 |   602 | So we would require as part of our sidewalk ordinance, Mr. Huber, the developer to install                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=592.0)  |
|     602 |   607 | sidewalks all along his frontage, throughout his frontage.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=602.0)  |
|     607 |   616 | And then we would also, obviously, we require, and this being street posted 30 miles an hour,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=607.0)  |
|     616 |   619 | we'd require 300 foot of sight distance in both directions.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=616.0)  |
|     619 |   623 | We also have some similar concerns about the access and the curve.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=619.0)  |
|     623 |   630 | So we're consistent with Mr. Shipley's comments and we'll make sure that those are addressed                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=623.0)  |

|     637 |   640 | I have not seen the site plan, no, sir.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=637.0)  |

|     641 |   644 | And then, Mr. Welch, was there anything from your team?                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=641.0)  |
|     644 |   650 | No, we just felt that the zoning was, requested zoning and density was consistent within the                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=644.0)  |

|    1957 |  1962 | We have continuously good relationships and good experiences with those.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1957.0) |

|    1967 |  1972 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1967.0) |
|    1972 |  1977 | That was part of my question. I got quite a few e-mails. I'm not sure about any of the other commissioners about this project.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1972.0) |
|    1977 |  1982 | Hearing that the developer has not reached out before all the e-mails and before we're here tonight,                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1977.0) |
|    1984 |  1989 | concerns me because I like when a developer will be proactive,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1984.0) |
|    1989 |  1994 | which causes a lot less problems down here.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1989.0) |
|    1994 |  1999 | If every developer would hear that, it causes a lot less problems at commission.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1994.0) |
|    1999 |  2004 | If the commission can know that the developer has tried to work with it,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1999.0) |
|    2004 |  2009 | are you going to make everybody happy 100% of the time? Absolutely not.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2004.0) |
|    2009 |  2014 | But you've made that effort to do that, and that, to me, goes a really long way.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2009.0) |
|    2014 |  2019 | So these are some of the concerns that the commission has to look into.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2014.0) |
|    2019 |  2024 | I agree with Commissioner Jay. We need more housing, but we have to do it                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2019.0) |
|    2024 |  2029 | to be respectful also of the people that have been here and paying 30 years of property taxes                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2024.0) |
|    2029 |  2034 | in that same aspect of what Commissioner Fraser is speaking of.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2029.0) |
|    2034 |  2039 | So I would just like to see that next time, that that's done proactively as opposed to reactively now that you guys are down here.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2034.0) |
|    2040 |  2045 | Yes, ma'am. I apologize. I'm not sure how we have overlooked that step.

|    2066 |  2071 | but I do agree with Commissioner Jay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2066.0) |

|    2109 |  2114 | And now we're going to probably waste taxpayer dollars defending a lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2109.0) |
|    2114 |  2119 | And I'm also having a hard time. So if anybody else wants to explain why,                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2114.0) |
|    2119 |  2124 | I would love to understand why besides you didn't talk to enough neighbors.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2119.0) |
|    2124 |  2129 | I don't know if that argument holds up in court.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2124.0) |
|    2129 |  2134 | I'm trying to make sense of this as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2129.0) |
|    2134 |  2139 | Thank you, Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2134.0) |
|    2139 |  2144 | Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner Ward, to that point, this is located in the Farragut Urban Growth Boundary.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2139.0) |
|    2144 |  2149 | So you have to take into consideration their design standards and their Planning Commission request.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2144.0) |
|    2152 |  2157 | That differentiates this piece of property from others that I would probably be in favor of five units per acre.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2152.0) |
|    2165 |  2170 | This is right along the boundary of the town of Farragut.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2165.0) |
|    2170 |  2175 | You can actually look at the map and see the county lines where we have them at five and four units per acre.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2170.0) |
|    2179 |  2184 | And then you can clearly see the town of Farragut's density is much different.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2179.0) |
|    2186 |  2191 | So I think this is a compromise in an area where it is appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2186.0) |
|    2192 |  2197 | So I understand your argument. I understand Commissioner Jay's argument.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2192.0) |
|    2197 |  2202 | I want higher density where there are major corridors as well. This isn't a major corridor.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2197.0) |
|    2202 |  2207 | This is not a major corridor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2202.0) |
|    2207 |  2212 | Is the property in Farragut? It is in the Urban Growth Boundary of Farragut.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2207.0) |
|    2213 |  2218 | And I think that it is responsible of this body to take that into consideration.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2213.0) |
|    2218 |  2223 | So that's what differentiates this property.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2218.0) |

|    3467 |  3472 | of what they've proposed is less than what the ask was.

|    3898 |  3903 | because you're putting planned residential in the one area where                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=3898.0) |

|    3926 |  3931 | Mr. Mullins, do you have anything to add?                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=3926.0) |
|    3931 |  3936 | Briefly, it's precisely because of the environmental conditions that this property is appropriate for the planned residential zone,                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=3931.0) |
|    3936 |  3941 | because that gives you the flexibility to design around those environmental problems and conditions,                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=3936.0) |

|    3961 |  3966 | for well over 20 years.

|    4386 |  4391 | I think the median Mr. Sell talked about, you know, for affordable housing is $315,000.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4386.0) |

|    6217 |  6222 | and it's something the county needs to invest in,                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6217.0) |
|    6222 |  6227 | and of course higher tax rates and higher tax bases can help do that, but                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6222.0) |
|    6227 |  6232 | we're aware that the traffic on Westland was an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6227.0) |
|    6232 |  6237 | Even before I got involved, Mr. Higgins had the foresight to email                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6232.0) |
|    6237 |  6242 | Mr. Snowden and ask him, okay, we're talking about right now we could do 8 units an acre.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6237.0) |
|    6242 |  6247 | We're proposing 12 units an acre, which the difference in that is an additional 16 units.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6242.0) |
|    6247 |  6252 | So 16 units is the difference between what's allowed now and what could be allowed,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6247.0) |
|    6252 |  6257 | and the email to Mr. Snowden is, do you have any issues or concerns                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6252.0) |
|    6257 |  6262 | with this, either at the 30 units that it could go in now or the 46 units,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6257.0) |

|    6272 |  6277 | Mr. Snowden checked the traffic data on this section, about 9,000 vehicles per day.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6272.0) |

|    6292 |  6297 | sometimes on the Westlands, bad anywhere in Knox County, but you're dealing with a range of services                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6292.0) |

|    6647 |  6652 | That was my fault, yeah. So what considerations can we                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6647.0) |
|    6652 |  6657 | make to improve infrastructure, and what are you referring to, because that was the decision made                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6652.0) |
|    6657 |  6662 | by staff?

|    6662 |  6667 | just within the right-of-way, Jim and I were just chatting, if you could just put in shoulders, where                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6662.0) |
|    6667 |  6672 | potentially right now it has no shoulders in that area, so at least you'd have some sort of                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6667.0) |
|    6672 |  6677 | existing foot or two more on the outside of the lane for forgiveness along that corridor.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6672.0) |
|    6677 |  6682 | Is that something that could be done? Is that something that the applicant is willing to do?                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6677.0) |
|    6687 |  6692 | The roadside's very level now, so it would be relatively easy to do,                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6687.0) |
|    6692 |  6697 | and I think that would be something. It looks like                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6692.0) |
|    6697 |  6702 | on our plans, it looked like we had a two-foot shoulder on either side of the white line before you got to the curb,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6697.0) |
|    6702 |  6707 | so if they were to put a two-foot shoulder on their side, that would make it consistent with                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6702.0) |
|    6707 |  6712 | what is, I guess, proceeding there, the west of there. And we'd be willing to do that.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6707.0) |
|    6712 |  6717 | I mean, we hadn't had that level of detail. Of course, we haven't moved forward with our development plan through planning                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6712.0) |
|    6717 |  6722 | yet, but other than the traffic, there's no infrastructure. I mean, there's plenty, there's utility capacity                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6717.0) |
|    6722 |  6727 | there. I mean, there's no other issues other than Westland Road itself, and                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6722.0) |
|    6727 |  6732 | unfortunately, it's constrained in what can be done with it. And if we can make those                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6727.0) |
|    6732 |  6737 | improvements along the way, I would like to suggest that. We tend to get too subjective                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6732.0) |
|    6737 |  6742 | with some of our considerations, and that's something                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6737.0) |

|    6803 |  6808 | There's a turn lane on Westland Drive at Sanford Day.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6803.0) |
|    6808 |  6813 | Yeah, that's the only one I saw. At Gallagher View Road, there's turn lanes in both directions.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6808.0) |
|    6813 |  6818 | But I'm seeing like nine or ten neighborhoods, and none of them have turn lanes.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6813.0) |
|    6818 |  6823 | None of them do have, correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6818.0) |

|    6838 |  6843 | you said on their side of the property you have a 20-foot right-of-way?                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6838.0) |
|    6843 |  6848 | Yes, sir. Okay, so if there was going to be a deceleration lane                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6843.0) |
|    6848 |  6853 | and an acceleration lane, how much width would you have to have to be able                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6848.0) |
|    6853 |  6858 | to do that? I mean, lane width through there                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6853.0) |
|    6858 |  6863 | for auxiliary lanes like that, we'd want to see at least 11 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6858.0) |
|    6863 |  6868 | At least 22 feet, one for the center and one for the right-turn lane.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6863.0) |
|    6868 |  6873 | Usually lane widths on auxiliary lanes are 11 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6868.0) |

|    6882 |  6887 | and you want to turn into their subdivision, okay, you would have to have                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6882.0) |
|    6887 |  6892 | 11 feet of road surface on their property side to do a turn lane?                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6887.0) |
|    6892 |  6897 | Yes, sir.

|    6898 |  6903 | And then they'd need the same 11 feet if they're leaving the subdivision                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6898.0) |

|    6908 |  6913 | For an acceleration lane? Yes.

|    7671 |  7676 | East Knoxville in particular is a food desert, which is a major issue in your community.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7671.0) |

|    7681 |  7686 | issue.

|    7686 |  7691 | I think it's important that people have access to food, to affordable food.

|    7696 |  7701 | big concerns that this is going to be on these roads can handle the traffic for                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7696.0) |

|    7951 |  7956 | If this was to be approved and they were to put a retail store there,                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7951.0) |
|    7956 |  7961 | would we be requiring vegetation buffer and                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7956.0) |
|    7961 |  7966 | lighting plans so that the neighbors won't be disturbed?

|    7966 |  7971 | there's residential around it. The last thing I want is for them to be disturbed.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7966.0) |

|    7981 |  7986 | Mr. Welch has brought to my attention that the planning report also                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7981.0) |
|    7986 |  7991 | requires a type B landscaping that's 12-foot wide.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7986.0) |
|    7991 |  7996 | So there would be a requirement for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7991.0) |
|    7996 |  8001 | Okay, so it's already mandated.

|    8523 |  8528 | Well, I mean, I'm just going to offer a comment because I think I read tea leaves pretty well.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8523.0) |
|    8528 |  8533 | But I just I wish we could move forward with this quicker because                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8528.0) |
|    8533 |  8538 | I know there are people that are waiting for us to pass the non drive through part of this ordinance.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8533.0) |
|    8538 |  8543 | And honestly, the drive through part seems to be the only one that's really contentious.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8538.0) |
|    8543 |  8548 | We could we could pass this minus the drive through parts as Commissioner Daly moved.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8543.0) |
|    8548 |  8553 | There are people that can move forward with projects that are going to create housing                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8548.0) |
|    8553 |  8558 | for this county. And they've been waiting on this for months now.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8553.0) |
|    8558 |  8563 | You got a project on on deck. It's kind of hard to keep waiting more and more months.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8558.0) |
|    8563 |  8568 | So I sure wish we could pass the original motion. Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8563.0) |
|    8568 |  8573 | Thank you, Commissioner Beeler. Commissioner Daly. Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8568.0) |
|    8573 |  8578 | Director Welch, what is your your opinion?                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8573.0) |
|    8578 |  8583 | Can we there's no questions about the CB zones and all that. It's all about the drive                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8578.0) |
|    8583 |  8588 | through. Why can in your opinion, can we pass the first part of it and send                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8583.0) |
|    8588 |  8593 | the second drive through without and get the business people moving                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8588.0) |
|    8593 |  8598 | in the right direction? I mean, staff would be supportive of that                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8593.0) |
|    8598 |  8603 | because of the you know, these are the only commercial districts that do not allow, you know,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8598.0) |
|    8603 |  8608 | multifamily unit developments in there. And we have a huge                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8603.0) |
|    8608 |  8613 | that's where you want to have the development and have the opportunities for mixed use in these                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8608.0) |

|    8618 |  8623 | I think, again, hearing the presentation earlier tonight and the need that we have been                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8618.0) |
|    8623 |  8628 | here for over the past several years, additional opportunities for multifamily                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8623.0) |
|    8628 |  8633 | development, particularly when we hear the arguments when they single                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8628.0) |
|    8633 |  8638 | family residential units. We don't want to have apartments next to us                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8633.0) |
|    8638 |  8643 | to single family residential. Well, if you can't have an extra residential and you cannot have it in a CA                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8638.0) |
|    8643 |  8648 | or CB, where are you going to put multifamily development? So this allows                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8643.0) |
