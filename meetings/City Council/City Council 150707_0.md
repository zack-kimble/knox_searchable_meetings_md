| 0:01:59| for four weeks. That's 12E? That's the rezoning of property on the north side of Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| Pike, east side of Montview. For how long? Four weeks. For four weeks. 12E, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=126)|

| 0:03:01| word to say thanks to our Special Events Office, to the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| and to all of our sponsors and partners for putting together the great festival on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| 4th at World's Fair Park on Saturday. It started out a little soggy, but the rain cleared up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| and there was actually a pretty nice-sized crowd there to see the fireworks. The symphony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| was fabulous. It's always great to see people from across our community come here for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| celebration. Hopefully everybody had fun. If you weren't there at World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| that you had a fun and safe time wherever you were for the 4th of July to celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| our independence. On a much sadder note, I want to convey my condolences to Chief Rausch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| and everybody at the Police Department on the loss last week of Lieutenant Robert Hembree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| I had a chance to know him a little bit, and I know that he was a man of great faith. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| had a great dedication to law enforcement, and particularly to our Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| He was very young, actually, and I know that his death came as a great shock to his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| to his friends, and of course to all of his co-workers. There was a huge outpouring of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| support. I was there to see his family at the receiving of friends, and it was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| I know they appreciated very much all of the response from the public and from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| to show them support for the loss of their husband and son and family member. Anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=267)|
| 0:04:39| we will continue to think about them and continue to send prayers their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| I want to introduce a new person here who is with us tonight and formally welcome him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| That is Gerald Green. Please stand up, Gerald. He is the new Executive Director of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Metropolitan Planning Commission, and Gerald and his wife have just moved to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| from North Carolina, where he was the Planning Director in Jackson County. But he's not new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| to Knoxville. He actually got his Master's Degree in Planning right here at the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| of Tennessee, a planning program that I also graduated from. And he also worked for a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=311)|
| 0:05:22| years as Principal Planner for the East Tennessee Development District before moving to North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Carolina, where he worked for a long time in the city of Asheville's Planning Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| and he also has private sector planning and consulting experience. So, Gerald, it's great to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| you back on this side of the mountains, and we know that you'll be a great addition to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| We're looking forward to working with you. He's already starting to make the rounds to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| partners, neighbors, and government and folks in the business community and all to get to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| people. So, welcome, Gerald. I know everyone will get to know you better as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| I think there'll be some events, some receptions and such, some meetings where you can meet everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| and everybody can spend some time with you. So, thank you very much. I also want to give a big thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| to Jeff Welch. Jeff sat on up. He served as the Interim Director of MPC for the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| and also Dan Kelly, who's been filling in here at all the council meetings. And I know, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| they're both glad that you're here. But we'll continue to let them be in that role and give you a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| bit of time to ease in and to get familiar with everything. But we do appreciate Jeff and Dan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| Y'all have done a fantastic job, and you will continue to do a fantastic job at MPC working with Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| And today was great news. We had a groundbreaking at the Sutree Landing Park, the new eight-and-one-quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| acre park in South Knoxville, which is part of the South Knoxville Vision Plan that's been on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| for a while. It'll take about a year to build it out, but in the end, there will be a festival lawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| a children's playground, an accessible boat dock, a put-in ramp, river overlooks and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| So, also, there'll be a close to 2,000-foot section of riverwalk, which will then eventually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=441)|
| 0:07:31| the idea is to have a three-mile riverwalk. But when we get this one done and the Baptist Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| riverwalk is done, and the riverwalk with the apartments near Island Home, and with the city view that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| already there, then we'll have one mile completed. So, we already have about a mile under construction or about to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| of that three-mile riverwalk that will eventually all be connected. There's also, as a part of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| there's a 3,000-foot-long, two-lane, tree-lined street we call Waterfront Drive, which is also being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| and that will offer direct access to the park. So, great news, I know, for South Knoxville, and Vice Mayor Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=487)|
| 0:08:16| was very happy. Many council members were there as well to join with us in breaking ground for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| And finally, I want to tell you all that next week, two representatives from Smart Growth America will be in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| to lead discussions with city and MPC staff about transit-oriented development. This came from a grant that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| awarded to CAT and to our Office of Sustainability. It will be a chance to learn about how to encourage development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| that takes advantage of transit options to maximize the benefits of our public transit system for neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| across the city. Now, as part of this workshop, there's also going to be a public presentation on transit-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| development on Wednesday, July 15th, so a week from tomorrow at 6 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| So we encourage council and folks in the community, neighborhood groups, developers, anyone with an interest in transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| issues and in transit-oriented development to come out with us. Again, it's Wednesday, July 15th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| at the East Tennessee History Center. So that's the end of my reports. Any reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=569)|

| 0:10:28| Thank you, Madam Mayor. As the Council is fully aware, we've been on this trek for some time now to fill the position of the city recorder, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=628)|
| 0:10:40| Can we stop our retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Yeah, I don't know if we can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| No offense to William.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| It's been a long process. After 35 years, we didn't really have a real process in place, to be honest with you, but we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=646)|
| 0:10:55| I want to especially thank Civil Service and Jim York for their help in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| and Councilwoman Palmer and Greve and Mayor Brown for their help in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=662)|

| 0:11:15| He has done yeoman's work, and we couldn't have got there without him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| He's just fantastic, so I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=680)|

| 0:11:37| He's done legal research, records management, and most importantly, he lives in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| I would certainly ask for your all's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| The 3rd District gets everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=708)|

| 0:12:07| I mean, she was here. She's been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Started when she was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Later, yeah. We can do it another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Yeah, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=734)|

| 0:12:45| Why the extra chair? You were wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| I thought you were going to have a speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| We're not paying you for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=769)|

| 0:16:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Councilman Dela Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Yeah, maybe, Jim, he's still down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| can you tell us just a bit about what's happening with the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| I take it the main reason is the project is stretched out longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| because of environmental, but there's more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| so tell us a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| It's not so much time as scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| The scope has really changed, not necessarily by our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| The state heritage officer asked us for a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| and that went beyond what we anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| and that's about a third of the budget change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| The other two-thirds are mostly stormwater redesign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| We did not know until we got into the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| that it's basically a 100-year-old drainage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| It's vitrified clay, which is crumbling away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| and it's pretty much undersized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| so they have to do a lot of engineering to redesign the drainage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| They're not concrete pipes, but clay pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Yeah, that's what they used 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| I mean, really, pretty close to 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| we're talking about this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| It's like a flower pot underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I mean, vitreous clay is harder than – it's not earthenware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| It is harder than a flower pot, but it's still the same general idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| and it doesn't last forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| with Barge, Wagner, Sumner, and Cannon, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| in an amount not to exceed $496,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| for the Magnolia Avenue streetscape project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I can't resist it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| We've been waiting for this for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Perhaps Jim or someone who's closer to this project can step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and just tell us a little bit about the streetscape work you're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| and what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Don Michelle, is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| I'll let Don Michelle go on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| It's the design work, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Go ahead, Don Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Don Michelle Foster, Deputy Director of Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| This is the Magnolia Avenue streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| What we did last year, we had a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| preliminary drawings done by a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| We're moving forward to go forward with final design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| that's going to include more in-depth detail on the streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| the street amenities, the enhanced sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and better bike lanes and enhanced bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| and bus pullouts along Magnolia Avenue for a four-block section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| This is going to showcase what sort of this can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| as development comes from downtown and starts moving down Magnolia, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| As we move from disinvestment, from investment, from the core out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| we're looking to revitalize Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| by making first steps with public improvements like the streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Magnolia Avenue is a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| We already have the bike lanes, the bus lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| We're just enhancing that, making the crossings safer for pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| and providing an opportunity to provide opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| for private investment to occur as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Will you have public meetings so people can be involved in the design decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| We hope to have the final designs completed by the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| and we will be going out to the public for another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| to have them look at the new streetscape designs on a final detail model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| We're also looking at the new gateway entry at Jazz Mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| so that will be part of that review from the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| I'm a little confused because the EIS document or the AIS says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| it will be completed by June 30, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| That's like two years almost, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I think that's possibly once we go through and study right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| We're not doing right-of-way services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| We're going to do an evaluation of properties that may be impacted by right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| so we hope to have the final designs completed by the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and then looking at right-of-way services to see what properties may be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| So we'll have a design to look at somewhere in December, January, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| We'll have a design to look at by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1262)|

| 0:22:51| modern technology moving into the police car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| and getting things done with sort of one stroke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| instead of two or three times down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| It's a system that we will put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| It will enhance our records management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1382)|

| 0:23:25| Municipal court and Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| So after the policeman has written on his iPad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| it's basically everyone's got the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1411)|

| 0:23:54| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Yes, Mayor, I'd like to ask if it's okay with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| that we move 12A to the last part that we get rid of these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| or we do these other items before we do 12A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| I didn't mean to say get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Expedite their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| If that's a motion, I will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| That would just be the postponement until the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Okay, was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Okay, is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1468)|

| 0:25:25| I've actually got a, this is the street name change for Charles Newman Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Is that what we're on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| No, we're on C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| I jumped the gun a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1533)|

| 0:25:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| 12D is an ordinance to change the street name of Riley Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| between Renford Road and Hollywood Road to Charles Newman Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| David William, applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Okay, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| The moment you've all been waiting for since the last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| This, we had, a few months ago we adopted an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| where any street renaming would need to go to the Public Property Naming Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| and at the time Mark Donaldson was on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| but somehow MPC didn't get that, and this has shown up on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| but the Public Property Naming Committee needs to review this prior to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| pursuant to the ordinance we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| So I'm going to be making a motion to refer this to the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| When do they next meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Well, we don't have regularly set meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| so that's why the motion is to refer it to them and refer it to the committee when they meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| because the situation with the committee is it's citizen-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| and it's difficult to get a quorum, so we have to see when people can meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| and then set the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And as you can imagine, applications come in sporadically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| so it doesn't make sense to have set meetings throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Okay, so there's a motion and a second to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| We do have Mr. David Williams would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| So come on down, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| So you know the motion is to defer it to the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Courtesy will, you know, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Again, for the record, David Williams, 505 Hollywood Drive, Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I'm excited, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Back early this year, I approached the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| about actually changing the name of the street from Riley Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| after my great-grandfather, Charles Newman Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| who was an outstanding gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| had connections with the Pond Gap community from the 1920s into the 50s in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| The first question the MPC posed to me was, is this going to be an honorary name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| I said, no, this is going to be an actual change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| So they were not aware of the rules going by the ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| So I meticulously followed all their well-thought-out, well-organized procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| We canvassed the neighborhood and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| There are six properties that border on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Not a single one would have their street name or mailing address changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| Very unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| So when it overwhelmingly passed the staff recommendation of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| and then the commissioners, it went on to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| and Mr. Steyer gave me a call saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| well, you need to go through the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| I don't understand what your committee will do that the Planning Commission has not already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| Now, I'd like to point out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| You have a set of procedures and so forth that you go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| I've got copies of the minutes of your last two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| and you failed to sign both of those, Mr. Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Also, the last meeting, June 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| you and two individuals showed up eight minutes late to your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| Three more individuals were ten minutes late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| We had five that did not even attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Sir, I point out to you, I think you did not have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| You're asking me to follow rules and regulations your committee set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| which apparently you don't follow yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| So I'm asking now, just go ahead and let's vote to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Now, I will throw out this bit of carrot to you, the mayor's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| Let her go ahead and pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| And you set up a meeting within the next week so we can get this settled and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| And I can honor, and the neighbors can honor my great-granddad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Am I making any sense with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| Are you finished, Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| What this is, you failed to properly notify the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| I mean, you can talk to Mr. Donald and say, hey, we've got this set up and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| Like I said, you're an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Apparently there's no city ordinance that gives teeth to what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| So I cannot understand philosophically what is your committee going to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| that the Planning Commission has not already looked at in fine detail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| Mr. Williams, just make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| We don't answer questions from the podium there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So you have the opportunity just to make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Are you completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Okay, so just a brief response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I called Mr. Williams today on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| He was much more polite earlier when I spoke to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| It's not an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| The committee is created by ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| It's on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| You know, I apologize to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| The allegations that we didn't have a quorum are incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| So, I mean, we've passed an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| and these type of things have to come before the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| So I'll stand by my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Okay, so Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| I would say I'm also a member of the Public Property Naming Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| and we did have a quorum for that last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| So I just wanted to make that known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| So there was a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| All right, so we have a motion and a second to defer this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Refer it to PP&C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| To refer it to PP&C, Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1886)|

| 0:31:39| J. Daniel Smith, Smith Ventures, LLC, applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1899)|

| 0:31:46| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I'm going to have to recuse myself from this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| and in fact that I'm working with these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you for letting us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Okay, so there is a motion and a second to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1922)|

| 0:32:13| Steven E. and George Ann Clabo, applicants, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1937)|

| 0:32:24| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Okay, so that takes us back now to 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1945)|

| 0:32:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Okay, so Council, we have a number of people who signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| so if you would, if it's okay with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| we'll go ahead and hear from them unless somebody specifically wants to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| I want to suggest one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I'm sorry, is there another light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Is the mic still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| We can go ahead and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Councilman Della Vothe, did you want to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| The last time we struggled through this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| we did sort of group comments by section so we could focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| I don't know if we're there or just it's going to be more general this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| but I'll throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Is there any need to focus on particular articles or sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| and hear the comments on that, or do you just want to hear them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| and then we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| All right, that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| I think typically we'll hear from the other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Typically I think we hear from everybody and then hear from the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| and then move on for council dialogue and debate, but Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I would agree that we need to hear the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Also, I would like to remind us all that we do have rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| and procedures in regard to speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| and so once you've spoken, cover it all rather than let's go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and have people talk to every single issue and back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| because we do have rules of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| and I'd really like to see us operate under those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| so we can get this done efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Let me go back to Councilman Starr here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I passed him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Yeah, I agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| And so do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| And then we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| So we will now hear from the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| and normally we have up to three who's on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| and up to three on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Most of these people, I'm not quite sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| They didn't sign up for or against, but they want changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| So maybe they're kind of for it with changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| or kind of against it with changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| I'm not sure, but there's only five of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| so why don't we just hear them through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Is this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| I think it's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| She's 12A as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| We have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| We have six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| We'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| This is the order that they signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| so we will hear it in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Kevin Murphy, Joyce Feld, John King, Carleen Malone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| Mike Edwards, and Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| So, Kevin Murphy, would you like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| And you all know I'll set the timer going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Name and address for the record, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| Mayor O'Hara, Vice Mayor Pavlis, Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Councilwoman Palmer, and Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| signs are helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| When you're driving down the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| with that gas gauge on the E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| seeing the blue highway sign that tells you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| that there's gas stations coming up at the next exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| really is comforting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| However, large tall signs that promote corporate image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| after corporate image erode a community's identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and a unique sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Kingston Pike near West Town Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| doesn't have that same Knoxville identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| that our beloved Market Square has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| or the identity that was featured yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| in the New York Times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| when a rider wandered down Central Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| through Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| The question before you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| can the height and size of signs be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| while businesses thrive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Yes, and it's been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Fort Collins, Colorado changed their sign regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| 37 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Here's a picture of Fort Collins back in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| You can see an Arby's sign, Safeway sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| several National Gas Station signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| and Dairy Queen sign there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Very few local businesses, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| That year, the city updated their regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| to encourage monument signs and lower pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| They adopted a vision that encouraged historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| and reduced clutter by moving utilities underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| By 2015, this year, the rule changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| resulted in a clean, attractive street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Here's an example of adapting to local regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| instead of imposing a standard sign package on a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| The local Honda dealership features monument signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| and they do a fine business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Gas stations still advertise their prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Restaurants, supermarkets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| and cash advance businesses stayed open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| None of these businesses needed tall, large signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| to get customers in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Fort Collins is comparable to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| We're both located near mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| and promote an active outdoors lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| We have universities, government research agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| and take pride in local food and local producers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| However, even with smaller signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| their business environment in some ways is better than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| They've attracted some technology companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| like Hewlett-Packard and Intel that we'd love to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| Statistics from a recent Forbes ranking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| showed Fort Collins as a better business environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| than Knoxville in many categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| And while they did that, they had lower unemployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and even a lower cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| as compared to national averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Today, you're being asked to set a vision for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Side by side, you can see that in Fort Collins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| change wasn't instantaneous, and it took time to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| If we take action to lower some signs and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| the sign fleets aren't going to go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| a week after the ordinance is enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Businesses will adapt over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| and communities with smaller signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| are great places to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Just ask Fort Collins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| or some other cities that have smaller signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| like Raleigh, Asheville, or Hilton Head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| These are great places to work, to do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| to visit, or to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Okay, next is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2329)|
| 0:39:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| And I just want to add my name to the list of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| who is going to very much miss Cindy Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| It's always been a genuine pleasure to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| So we will miss you, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| You have received, I'm sure you've noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| you have received about 400 emails since April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| from people who do not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| the maximum sign heights and sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| contained in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| The authors of these emails represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| a wide cross-section of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| They represent people of every political affiliation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| gender, age, race, and economic level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| They're business owners, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| blue-collar workers, white-collar workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| They all want to see a substantial improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| in the appearance of our city as a result of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| They all told you that more 40- and 30-foot signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| will not achieve this goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| and that they support the table of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| sign heights, and sizes proposed by Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| This is the community that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| This is your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| and your community very much wants you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| to adopt the heights and sizes that they desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| The time for this is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| This issue will not be revisited for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Knoxville has evolved into a forward-thinking city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| in many, many areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| and now it's time that we look like one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| Okay, now John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2457)|
| 0:41:08| Are you speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| No, I called on you now, so come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| Nice try, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| I'm just going down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| You have summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| I keep trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| John King, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| Mayor, members of the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| on behalf of two different clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| I sent to each of you some material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| related to each one of those clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| One of them was a proposed amendment to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| related to signage on hospital sites for on-premise signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| and that was a response to issues observed in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| I also sent you, I guess you would call it a memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| with certain questions regarding concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| or questions on the part of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| I'm not here tonight to argue for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| any of the matters raised in either of those two documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| As I say, I'm not here to argue for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| with the expectation that those legitimate concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| and problems identified will be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| by way of subsequent action to either amend or clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| and at least minimize problems related to the points raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| I'm advised of Council's interest in getting this ordinance approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| and then deal with problems that arise at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| at some future point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| So I'm not opening up an argument on either of those matters sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| and just they're there for your review and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| and we will, when problems arise, revisit these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Do you have, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| are there documents you want to submit for the record to Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| I will do so. I'll come around so it's not interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| I'll pass it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Okay, Ms. Malone, welcome. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Mayor O'Hara, members of Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I sent all of you an e-mail yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| I believe it's 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| My concerns have to do with enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| and language that is clear and enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| And since I don't have clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I would prefer these problems be taken care of on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| not on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| When there are costly legal bills and unnecessary fights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| wasting everybody's time and everybody's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| it's really the full employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| The inability to get it right, by which I mean enforceable and clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| is really the full employment act for attorneys in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| And frankly, it's everybody else's waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| That's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| It's one thing for us to debate and disagree on whether or not we like something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| It is worthless to debate and disagree on what something means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| because we couldn't figure out how to write it in plain English on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| To that end, I bring to your attention a few matters that are, to me, exceedingly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| Number one has to do with Section 11.5 Office Zone Districts, 010203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| It seems to me there is a very seriously needed passage that was omitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| I'm hoping inadvertently, having to do with detached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| It just says you can have detached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Again, it doesn't specify what I think this council agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| the last time we met on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| It doesn't specify monument signs, which are permitted at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| This would open it up to poll signs, which I don't think this council wanted in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| They're not permitted now, and they shouldn't be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Number two has to do with the introduction to the definition section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| I have looked at many zoning ordinances, and I'm not an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| but I can read the code from other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| There is no other zoning ordinance I have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| nor does our zoning ordinance in the definition section of Article 2 say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| the meaning of the words as stated below unless the context suggests otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| That's not how these things are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| That, ladies and gentlemen, is nothing, nothing, nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| but the opportunity to argue garbage for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| And let's be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Questions of interpretation, the minute somebody gives a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| I don't care what you think or I think or anyone else thinks the words meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| That permit is good, and unless this city is willing to pay out money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| somebody is going to build based on that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So, please, that section, let's make it consistent with what it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| in the beginning of Article 2, the definition section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| and the rest of the code, the rest of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| The third thing has to do with EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I was told over and over again, EMCs, nothing was changed by the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| or through this three-year effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Well, one big thing was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| EMCs came under commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Commercial and industrial words are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| I think that opens every zone to EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| I sent material to Councilman Greave and Councilman Wallace back in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| that I hope somebody has looked at since and sent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| I was told it was sent on to the law department because I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| to be very clear what we're doing with EMC or EMC components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Do we really want them in office zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Are they illuminated signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| How do we handle inconsistencies within the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| Number four has to do with specifying the type of attached signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| in certain districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| It's one thing to say you can have an attached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| It's something else to say you can attach signs limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| and list out those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| If you don't do that, and down the pike as technology changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| or some future council decides to put in a roof sign as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| instead of a prohibited sign, suddenly in the office zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| and other zones you will have roof signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Let's make it necessary for any future council to take affirmative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| to put something like a roof sign or some new type of sign in every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| rather than just being part of the umbrella of the very simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| faultless word attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| They have to do, again, with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| This has been, I know, an exhausting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| and my heart goes out to all of you who are dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| I understand how difficult it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Okay, next we have Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| My name is Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| I, too, want to echo appreciation that you all undertook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| There's a reason why you're not doing sign ordinances every millennium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| and it's because it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| And it's not just a matter of trying to balance conflicting interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| It is trying to get to where the language is going to be as such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| that it means what you think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| We support the proposal in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Are there things in it that we would wish were not there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| I think people who feel strongly differently from us see things in there that wish were not there, or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=2998)|
| 0:50:11| But really, we're kind of talking about what happens in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| when you're moving forward with change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| This proposal represents a 40% change in sign heights, a 40% change in sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3019)|
| 0:50:29| That is not an insignificant change for the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| That is a major hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| But we support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| We would say that we would hope that language, particularly in and around change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3040)|
| 0:50:50| will be more clarified as you move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| and I would hope that you would revisit businesses needing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| or being required to register their signs within 30 days of you adopting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3063)|
| 0:51:13| Number one, it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Whether they're required or not, they're simply not going to be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| So what is the purpose of registering signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| That being said, I'd urge you to adopt this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| It's representative of a lot of work from a lot of people, including the sign task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| and it's time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Now Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you for being here, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| My name is Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| My address is 10040 Costa Real Cove, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| Can you pull that mic a little closer to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I can bend over as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Madam Mayor and Council, I've been in the outdoor advertising business for 43 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I have worked in other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| I've worked with ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| I've worked with state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| So I've spent a lot of time trying to read ordinances in the language to control signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| I understand that you're not going to answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| but I guess some of these that I'm stating are kind of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| We'll deal with them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| But I do agree with Carlene Malone that the enforceability of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| the clarity of the ordinance needs to be dealt with on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| This thing, in my opinion, certainly from an on-premise and off-premise use definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3170)|
| 0:53:00| they're two animals, two different animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| But to me, this ordinance by definition combines billboards, off-premise, signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3183)|
| 0:53:15| and mixes them together by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Now, if I'm wrong, I'd like to know, and that way it'll cut off a whole lot of what I've got to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| because they are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| But by definition and by words through the ordinance, they're mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| So, for example, like I said, in definition, page 3 and page 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3211)|
| 0:53:40| they combine billboards and off-premise into sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| Section 3 prohibited signs, section number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| Do you mean to disallow private property owners from having on-premise signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| but allow state logo signs to be off-premise advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3235)|
| 0:54:03| That's a question I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Off-premise is off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| The only difference is private sector doesn't get to have the benefit of the structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| but the state government can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| So in my opinion, if you're going to regulate off-premise advertising, you regulate all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| not just ban the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Section 7.6, are detached signs, because by definition a sign is a billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| are detached signs billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| They're mixed by definition once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Do you expect a square or rectangular footing underneath a billboard pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| I don't know who does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| But in my personal opinion, as you create blockage by the signs that are going to have to be filled in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| between the poles, I think you've got a problem coming out on highways from side streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| and that sort of thing, because I do believe it blocks the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| I know it blocks the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Section 9.4, by definition, are directory signs off-premise billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3307)|
| 0:55:18| Section 13.1, abandonment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| Certainly in off-premise advertising signs, abandonment has to happen by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3324)|
| 0:55:33| He has to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Or you can't just come in and say he abandoned it because the face was blank for 60 days or 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| That's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Section 14.3, effective change in use, because the sign definitions are mixed and not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3345)|
| 0:55:57| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Because they're not clear, if I have a change in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| does the billboard have to come down to be in accordance with the new rules and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| It's going to be a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| 13.7208 protects the property owners in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| So those are some of the questions I had in a quick perusal of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| It really needs to be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| It's going to be some interpretive problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| And there's a lot of parts that are clear and some that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| I think by definition, if you separate off-premise to on-premise, it will help a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Okay, council, that's all the people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| I just sort of wanted to go ahead and get out of the motion, but before I get into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| I think Knoxville, we have a beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We've got beautiful parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| We've got a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| We have a view of the mountains, great neighborhoods, an attractive downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| And I think one shortcoming we have is that our corridors, particularly our commercial corridors, are very ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3423)|
| 0:57:12| They're blighted, and I think we all realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| You know, as leaders, I think the community is looking for us to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| And it's not just signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| It's utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| It's make them complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| It's landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| It's buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| It's all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| But signs are part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| And we've taken a lot of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| What we're doing on Cumberland, there's new sign regulations there, changing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| What's going on on Central and in Magnolia, all these things are efforts to improve our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| And I think signs is a huge part of that, and that's what's in front of us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| You know, I don't think low signs are anti-business, and you don't need to go to Hilton Head to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| You can go right out to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| They have six-foot signs, and it's one of the most busy retail areas in Knoxville, if not East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| So really the question is before us, you know, is 30 feet, you know, is that a big enough reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| The problem for me is that 30 feet will continue the type of development we've got out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| And I don't think that's a direction we want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| I don't think that's our vision of what the city and our corridors could be as attractive places that people want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| potentially to live, to ride their bike down, to walk down sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| And it's just like the Fort Collins example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| It's a long-range vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| It's going to take a long time, but we need to take a big step now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| And then also just compared with other communities close to us, Maryville and Oak Ridge, their highest sign height is 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3530)|
| 0:59:00| So the current proposal just doesn't get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| So, you know, I'd make a motion to adopt the numbers that this council originally adopted back in 2011 of 25, 20, 15, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3543)|
| 0:59:18| So it would be 25 for the property within 500 feet, 20 for property adjacent to the interstate right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| 15 to the property fronting federal designated highways, and 10 for all other roadways classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3565)|
| 0:59:33| So this would be amending the table on Section 11.6, Section C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3573)|
| 0:59:50| Is that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| 5, 20, 15, and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| And these are the same numbers that this council adopted almost four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| So it's been a long process, but I think sometimes you have to sort of go back to where you started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Can I offer a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Well, I agree with most of what Councilman Stair said, that we do need to help our community to enhance its beauty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3619)|
| 1:00:29| and we're already a beautiful community, but I think we can be prettier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| And certainly shorter, lower signs will, in my view, help enhance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| I think, however, there are some other ways to do that, and actually Councilman Stair touched on one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| and that is currently the corridor improvement we're doing on Cumberland Avenue, which will affect the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| And I think those same disciplines will begin to occur as we consider corridor overlays for various different parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| especially the major state highways in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| So my amendment would be a little different than what Councilman Stair put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| And that would be same item, 11.6C, our packet, page 321,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| to leave the property within 500 feet of the interstate, 40 feet, the property adjacent to the interstate, 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3679)|
| 1:01:30| property fronting on federal designated highways, 25, and all other road classifications, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3690)|
| 1:01:40| Okay, yours is 40, 25, 25, and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| Okay, is there a second to that substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Okay, is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Now, let me ask if the substitute motion passes, then the original amendment is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3712)|
| 1:02:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| If it doesn't, then are we back to that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| So a discussion on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| Councilman Stair, did you have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Well, this is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| This was sort of, I guess, at the point we were five hours into our last meeting on signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| and I think everyone was pretty much fatigued with the details we were confronted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| There certainly needs to be some adjustment to the sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| It seems like it kind of petered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| They had the first one at 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| And if you recall, when we were here and Mark Donaldson was working with us several years back in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| the original proposals were based somewhat on the speed of the vehicle moving down the roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| and the thinking, rightly or wrongly, was that if you're going really fast, say 60 miles an hour on an interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3776)|
| 1:03:04| you have less time to see and absorb the information and still pay attention to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| And in that situation, the sign height and the area of the sign was considered fair to be bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3790)|
| 1:03:18| and I think that's how they got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| We have heard from others recently about things like, well, if you have logo signs on the interstate, some of that dissipates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| but there's certainly a good argument for a taller or bigger sign where cars are going fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| That trickled down to first the U.S. highway-type things, the federal highways like the Kingston Pikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| and some of the other roads and Chapman Highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| And again, you had speed but lesser speed, and so some argument was made for lesser height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| As you get more and more local, I mean, it does stand to reason that, number one, you have more time to observe the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| Number two, if you're in a car and you're looking up 30 feet, you probably can't see the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| I mean, the reality is your vision is more in a 20 or 25-foot range max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| I mean, you're driving on a road, you're paying attention to the cars and pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| and you want to be able to see a sign where you can turn into a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| So if that's its goal, to foster good business, and we all want that for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| no good business, there's no jobs, there's no tax revenues, the city withers, and that's not a healthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| So we're trying to balance both the need for some aesthetic improvement in beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3872)|
| 1:04:40| and the desire to improve the quality of our community and the appearance of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| And we've all been to cities where the signs don't overwhelm you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| We've had speakers in the past who made a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| The overhead utilities sometimes are worse than the signs in terms of visual clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| and I guess that's something we can work with over time with KUB and others to see where we can underground them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| and they're doing it in some of these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| We are looking at indirectly, and I guess our new MPC director will have a chance to weigh in on these issues in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| the idea of corridor overlays that may set up standards for areas of the city that want to have tighter appearances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3915)|
| 1:05:26| better looking, more functional, more people friendly, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| So I'm inclined to support the amendment because I think it tends to put the signs on smaller roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3931)|
| 1:05:44| or slower roads to a lower height in a lower area, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| My concern, of course, and we all should be mindful of this as citizens, that the state has favored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3950)|
| 1:06:00| or caved into whatever the billboard industry in the sense of grandfathering signs that have been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| and whether we change a rule or regulation in Knoxville will not end signs that are lawful at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3967)|
| 1:06:16| They're going to stay there as long as they're at least not abandoned and in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| and we've heard some debate about what that might mean and what's a fair way to determine that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| but the reality is that it's going to take some time to change our appearance just because the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| which trumps anything we can pass, will grandfather those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| That doesn't mean, however, that we shouldn't make a stab at planning and working on the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| And so I think in fairness to the business community, but also to the residents of whom we have heard many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| that the lesser signs of, I think he said 40, did you say 40, 30, 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| 40, 25, 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| 40, 25, 25, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| 40, 25, 25, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| That's Fenbar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| The first one stays the same and you change the next three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Well, the 225s and the 20 being the local road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| I'm willing to support that, and those are my reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| So you're supporting the substitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| The substitute motion made by Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Colonel Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Steyer, Saunders, I appreciate you all bringing those amendments forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| because I think we're making great progress from where we were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| With an ordinance that said 40 and 30 everywhere else was too bold and not well received by the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4056)|
| 1:07:45| and I appreciate you all recognizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| This is our opportunity to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| We've done an enormous amount of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| We've heard from an enormous amount of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| and overwhelmingly the support has been to make significant changes in sign height and sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| It's undoubtedly the overarching voice that I've heard through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| Yes, we have to be fair to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| I'm a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I have signs in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| I'm very aware of that, and I think we've got to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| We've looked at that, and we're trying to address that, trying to bring that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| But overwhelmingly the voice that we've heard over and over for these three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| is that the community wants to see a better signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| and that's what we're trying to put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| We've worked hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| I appreciate everyone's effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I appreciate the input that we've gotten from numerous and countless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| However, I can't support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| I don't want to get greedy here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I mean, I like the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| It's better than where we were at 40, 30, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| But I'm not sure that 40, 25, 25 as much as a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| and leaving 20 in the small roads is really going to be any different than what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| 20 feet on a neighborhood road is still exceedingly high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| So I think we can do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| And of the two amendments that have been presented, I would have to support STAIRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| This is on a discussion that we're having now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| It seems like I've been having for the last four years in terms of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| I think that there's no doubt that sign heights is one of the things that has really been talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| and is of the most concern to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| I think that one of the things that I want to be sure that this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| and the citizens realize that not only are we trying to come up with a better sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| not only are we trying to come up with a better vision for our city in terms of what we want to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| but there's other aspects in this ordinance that we need to really take a careful look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| which has to do with the maintenance and the upkeep of signs, the abandoned signs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| There's a number of issues that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| I also want to say that the sign ordinance that we have before us is not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| We've worked on it for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| There are a number of things that are still being worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Hopefully, even though we've jumped right in on the sign heights there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| I hope that we will be able to discuss other issues of the sign ordinance this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| Even as of late this afternoon, the law department and us have been talking about certain issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| that will come up before us in terms of amendments that we need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Someone made a comment earlier in the evening that the sign ordinance may not be looked at for another 10 or 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| As long as I'm on city council, we're going to continue to amend this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| and we're going to continue to look at the different articles that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| We're going to continue to listen to the people, not only the business folks, but also the neighborhood folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| But let's also remember that they're all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Business folks are neighborhood folks in terms of what all of us want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| I don't know if it's appropriate to make an amendment to an amendment to an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| I guess it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| So I would like for council to consider the fact that the sign task force did spend three and a half years working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4275)|
| 1:11:25| They spent a lot of time reviewing other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| They took a long time at looking at thousands of building permits that have been asked for over the number of years here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4290)|
| 1:11:40| And it was difficult, but they did come up with a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| I know several people think it was not a compromise, but those people on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| it was voted six to three to have the sign heights at the interstate at 40 feet and at other places in the city 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4310)|
| 1:12:00| I'd like to remind council also that in reviewing those permits for the last 12 years that have been in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| that 78 percent of the permits were less than 24 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| Some have said, well, if that's the case, then why not just go ahead and put it at 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| Well, part of a compromise has to do with working with a whole group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| And there was compromise to say that even though 78 percent of the signs in the city had been less than 24 feet in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4340)|
| 1:12:28| that why not go ahead with 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| And that was the vote that was taken, six to two, on the county, I mean on the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| The other thing that I look at, both Finbar and Marshall referred to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| we have an opportunity that we have a sign ordinance, and I'm convinced after the last four years of study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| I know Mr. Stare has referred to what we on council did four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| We jumped into something without a lot of research, without a lot of input from either the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| or the neighborhood groups when we came up with that one solution to sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| We have the opportunity to look at our major corridors, as Mr. Stare was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| and see how we want those corridors to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| I'm convinced that not one size fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| As you see on Cumberland Avenue, if you've had a chance to review those sign regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| they're much more strict than what our regular ordinance has, and we have that opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| I'm going to push for the Bearden District to have an overlay in the Bearden District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| where we can get the sign or the business folks and the neighborhood folks together in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| to determine what it is that they would really like along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| And we have that opportunity to do that along Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| That's the next area that's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| But, you know, the sign requirements for Cumberland Avenue will not be the same as what we have on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| It's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| It's a whole different roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| It's a whole different system out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| What's going to happen in the Bearden area, hopefully when we get to mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| where we have pedestrian as well as businesses, where we have mixed use through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| that the requirements for signage is going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| And so we'll have an opportunity also there to do an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| and to look at what those folks would like to see in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| And the same thing with Chapman Highway, same thing with, as I said, Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| that all those areas that we'll be able to look at, and I think that we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| Even the South Waterfront has certain regulations for their signs, and so that can happen at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| I would like to have consideration for what the sign task force recommended to this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| which was the 40 feet along the interstate and 30 feet everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| So I would like for you just to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| There are other items as we go through the ordinance that we take a look at this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| and see about having amendments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| But as I mentioned also, there are several items that I'm going to ask the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| to continue to look into that we won't be able to solve this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| So this is an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| It's been going on for four years and even longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| So I think it will continue to be modified, but hopefully we can come up with the best results as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| And I'm going to concur with what most of Councilman Grieve has said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| I think I see where this is going, but I just have a problem with these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| I'm not going to support the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I'll just say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| I don't think it's going to make much difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| But what I do think makes a difference is the quality of work that was done over the last three and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| or however many years it was that the task force and the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| the neighborhood scenic Knoxville, all the people who came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| and worked hard to come up with a reasonable ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| and we're just going to basically just do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| And I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| There was a tremendous compromise on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| I think that it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I think that we should adopt it and continue to work with it, as Mr. King alluded to, and I think Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4583)|
| 1:16:32| We are going to come back with other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| I think that for tonight's business it was best that we didn't throw anything else on the pile, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| But I'm just concerned that we're just going to throw away the hard work that was done, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| by the people that I talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| I think it's fair where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Can we continue to look at it down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| But I just think that we are really doing a disservice to the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| while we've got the opportunity to make things better, and I think we will make things better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| if we just adopt the ordinance that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| It makes things better, and it's a little bit perhaps not what everybody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| but when we started this process, you know, we've come to where both sides are probably a little bit mad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| but I'm not going to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Again, I'm going to support the work of the people who served on this committee who represent our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| who've invested in our community, both from a neighborhood standpoint but from businesses as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| and we can't have one without the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| So I'm a little discouraged that I think that where this is going, but I won't be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4666)|
| 1:17:55| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| I agree with Vice Mayor Pavlis and Councilman Grieve that the task force did put a great deal of time into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4683)|
| 1:18:14| to come up with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| I think a signed ordinance will always be a work in progress because as a community evolves, needs evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4695)|
| 1:18:24| and signed ordinances and other ordinances need to respond to those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| I really do believe that we should go ahead and adopt the ordinance as presented without any amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4710)|
| 1:18:41| Councilman Saunders, I'm having serious second thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| But without any amendments, if we find that we have erred, and if we haven't, I'll be real shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4725)|
| 1:18:54| We can correct that at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| But I really do think that out of respect for the work of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| and other task forces we've had and those we'll have in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| if people can't believe that we will listen to the work of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| they're not going to be willing to serve on them and advise any city council currently or in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4752)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| Council, before I call on the other members, your counselor would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Just briefly, I'm not weighing in on the merits or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| but there are two alternative proposals on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| We have a motion and Councilman Saunders has followed up with his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| I might be able to consider kind of a procedural motion to divide the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| where you talk about each height separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| You know, you have one discussion on the 500 feet of an interstate exchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| one on a separate one to see if that might be an easier way to address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| Well, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Obviously, I am in favor of my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| But if it doesn't get five votes, I'd certainly be in favor of Mr. Saunders' amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| So if I vote no and the no votes win, then we could vote on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| And if I don't get five votes, I can have a motion to reconsider his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Because I would be on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Yes, if you're on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Okay, so let's just vote on Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| I'm going to be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| But if my amendment doesn't pass afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| I'll be making a motion to reconsider Mr. Saunders' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4840)|
| 1:20:50| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I really appreciate the discussion that's just occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| and perhaps it will continue for a few more moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| And I am very sensitive to the remarks that Vice Mayor Pavlis made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| regarding the work the committee did, because there's no question that this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| not just this committee but this community, has had quite a vigorous discussion about signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| and some of it has been focused on the sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| And I really appreciate that and am very sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| What I'm trying to achieve is, you know, I was not part of that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| except kind of tangentially like many other citizens might have been as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| But trying to achieve something that I consider a little more balanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| and that also talks a little bit to the comments that Mr. Grieve just made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| about the average sign height over the last, what was it, 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Twelve years, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| And understanding, and I'll repeat this, understanding that this is not going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| there's a lot of other areas in this ordinance that in my mind need some tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| Whether we'll do that tonight or later, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| But whatever we do tonight, I am serious in my time on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| and I hope my time is extended, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| I really want to address other things in this ordinance that need to be clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4934)|
| 1:22:25| and simplified perhaps in some ways, because the work that has gone into this is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| And the fact that we've gotten all of this together in one ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| instead of having it various different places I think is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| And it makes for the business world, going out and applying for signs, I think it streamlines that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| I think it brings a good bit of simplicity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| or at least more simplicity to this than currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| So I would ask you to consider what my proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| If not, then we'll consider it, move from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| I just want to take issue with one thing that Councilman Pavlis and Palmer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| and I respect their right to take that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| but at the end of the day we asked someone, a group of someones, for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| But the people elected us, none of those people other than the two chair or co-chairs were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| The people looked to us to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| And that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I think we have to take everyone's position, whether it's a scenic group, whether it's a business group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| whether it's the committee, with a grain of salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| We are charged with making a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| We're not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| We're not saints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| But I think that the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| This council is shaping the future, and I think we ought to stand up and do what we think is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| We will probably disagree on what that is, but I think the responsibility is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| And as much as I love committees and task force, they were divided on this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| If you remember back in April, two or three of them stood up and said we were opposed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| and there was no vote on it, and I don't really care about the procedural history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| We got the recommendation, and we have to exercise judgment on behalf of the community or we're not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| One, Swanson, so there's two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| There's other issues that we want to address in amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| So I want to make sure that we don't get this thing voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| and then we don't have the right to come, we've lost our right to come back and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| You're just dealing with this amendment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Okay, we're just dealing with this amendment and then we'll pass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Well, I want to address that too, Nick, because there's, I mean, we all spend a lot of time on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| There was a lot more work went into the rest of and all the pages that are before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| the definitions, the wording, the minimum amount of time was talked about on Sine Height as opposed to the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5092)|
| 1:24:59| So there's a tremendous amount more work put into the task force's recommendation that we are taking carte blanche,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| that we are taking exactly the way it was presented, and we've taken a lot of their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| So it's not we're throwing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| I mean, their work was invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| But this was the contested issue on the task force, and it's a contested issue before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| and it's a contested issue in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| But the task force work is very appreciated, and we wouldn't be here without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| So we're not throwing it out at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| But this one issue is the issue that we've all wrestled with the most, and, honestly, it's the toughest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| But we're not throwing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Just by changing and tweaking this is not working it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| The law department has said we have issues, and we can't overlook that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| We don't want to put something, as Colonel Larry Malone suggested earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| we can't put something out that we can't enforce, or they become so ambiguous that it leaves us in a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| And the law department has come with recommendations over and above the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| so to suggest and to say that the task force is not appreciated if we make changes to it is simply really not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5165)|
| 1:26:15| But, anyway, that's all I have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Well, I just want to reiterate what George said, is that there was a lot of time, a lot of effort put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| and the task force members, they are appreciated for what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| But I do want to say that there was a lot of compromise in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| I know some of us wanted lower signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Some of us wanted higher signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| But I do want to emphasize what George has emphasized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| that this is not the only issue that we have with the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| and that we do hope that we'll be able to go through this regardless of how we end up with the particular heights of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5214)|
| 1:27:02| But this is kind of the leading issue that is in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| So, again, I hope that possibly, I don't know how you want to divide this up or how you want to do the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| but let's get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| So we've got right now a substitute motion made by Councilman Saunders, seconded by Councilwoman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| which is, this is the substitute motion, and the heights would be 40, 25, 25, and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| That's what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| Yeah, and I'm voting no to vote on my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| And then if that doesn't pass, I'll have a motion to reconsider Finbar's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| So does everybody understand we're voting on Councilman Saunders' substitute motion, 40, 25, 25, 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Would you just repeat what's in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| So the current, what's on the paper right now is 40, 30, 30, and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| 40, 30, 30, and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| So Councilman Saunders has 40, 25, 25, 20 in the four different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5285)|
| 1:28:14| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| Okay, so let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5301)|

| 1:28:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5310)|

| 1:28:32| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| Okay, so that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Madam Mayor, I'd like to reassert my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| That's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| That's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| So the motion now is 25, 20, 15, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| I'd call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| 25, 20, 15, and 10, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| 25, 20, 15, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Which is what you said originally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| All right, so now we're at the amendments offered up by Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| 25, 20, 15, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| We'll do a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5356)|

| 1:29:18| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5365)|

| 1:29:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5367)|

| 1:29:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| I mean, no, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5374)|

| 1:29:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| It was a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| The waffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| That also fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I'd make a motion to reconsider Councilman Saunders' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Okay, a motion to reconsider the 40, 25, 25, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| You have to vote on the motion to reconsider first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| and that requires simply a majority in the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| If it were at a later meeting, it would require a two-thirds majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| But in this meeting, it will require five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=5401)|

| 1:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| The question is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| It has to be voted on without debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6163)|

| 1:42:51| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| So we will have the question has been called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| I'm sorry, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| We can't hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| So now we are voting on the motion, which is the 35, 30, 20, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| I'm troubled by that 10, but I'm going yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Councilman Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Passed the 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| So we've covered 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| We've got one link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| 11-6C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| We've got one link of sausage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| So are there other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Just a little bit of housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| In the section 1 article, in essence, about general provisions, 1.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Section 1.3, the first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| I think that phrase on the third line should read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| requirements are provided in a specific zone district, comma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| or adopted corridor overlay, comma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| and then the requirements of districts in Article 4 shall prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| In other words, I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Let me just state the purpose is to include not only specific zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| but adopted corridor overlays so that we can make more specific decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| in the future, and we'd have to take those up one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| And I just think it's not only the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| but it could be a corridor overlay within a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| And I'm just saying we should add those words so that we know that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| have the ability to have other sign requirements that are exclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| to a corridor overlay area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| And however you phrase that, I'll defer to Krista or Frost on putting that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| But not only zones but adopted corridor overlays would allow that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| special requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| But an overlay is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| You still have the base zone underneath the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| So I'm not, you know, I'm not sure if that's necessary, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| I see Mr. Kelly getting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6324)|
| 1:45:39| I'm just thinking it would apply to less than the entire zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| It would just be the one area within that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| I think from my perspective, an overlay district is also a zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| We treat them as base zoning districts and overlay zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| So I think the term zone district would encompass a corridor overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| Okay, well, I'll defer to the lawyers who are going to defend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| I thought we were going for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| The next definitional section, I'm concerned about canopy sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| and I admit this is from ignorance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| but if you turn to page 293 in the packet, it's about the fourth page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| any type of sign placed on a canopy so the display surface is parallel to the plane of the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6381)|
| 1:46:30| And I keep wondering, I wonder if it's perpendicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| Is that a canopy sign or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Is it something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| I just wasn't sure why they limited it to parallel to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| It's just sort of under the canopy, I guess, or something, or on the canopy itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| I don't know why we picked out perpendicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| It seems to leave out some signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| So I would ask that we clarify that, whether it's parallel or perpendicular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| or any other relationship to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Well, let's see if somebody wants to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Can't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I think that what it's referring to is what's on the face of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| So if the sign were elsewhere on the canopy, it wouldn't be a canopy sign per this definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6428)|
| 1:47:16| We would treat it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| We probably wouldn't permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| What if it's on the side of the canopy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| It would be perpendicular to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| I mean, it just seems restrictive when there's three sides to the canopy sticking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| There would be three sides to the canopy sticking out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| and you've picked the front facing the road but not the two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| And I don't know why we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| I'm going to scroll up to the definition for canopy and see if that's helpful in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| But I understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| That's a sign type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| It doesn't help, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| But you can see the picture of the canopy, and there's three sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| and you can have writing on all three or just one face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| Anyway, I would suggest it be inclusive of anywhere on the face of the canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6486)|
| 1:48:19| Mayor, while they're looking that up, just a question about procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Are we going to go through section by section instead of just randomly picking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| That's really up to council on what you would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| Are there enough amendments that we need to approach it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| I think that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Well, we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| He's done one, and now he's on two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| So we'll just move on through the major sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I just have one more in that if they tell us what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| While they're chewing, I'll direct your attention to the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| In the interest of cities that like bicycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| directional sign is a sign designed to guide vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| Elsewhere in this document, we do mention all three types of people that view signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| but here we didn't, and I would add the word bicycle after vehicular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| because I don't think it's pedestrian to be on a bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| And that's just a technical fix, again, nothing heavy lifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Directional sign, he said add bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| Bicycle is a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| It's a vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Yeah, it is a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| You don't have to have four wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| We don't need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| We have a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Okay, so we're saying that's inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| He's saying other times it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| Why don't you just leave it up so that the display surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| Why do you tie yourself to the plane of the wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Being parallel to the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6597)|
| 1:50:20| While our staff is taking a look at this, we will take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6620)|
| 1:50:37| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| I'd like to, after talking with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| the definitions and their wordsmithing and that sort of thing are not substantive changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| and we should be able to lay those aside, pass those comments along to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| and they can continue to chew on them and wordsmith them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| We'll have it on second reading to look at any of those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| I'd like to move to there are a few substantive changes that I would like to talk about tonight, and if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6661)|
| 1:51:11| Is that okay with you, Councilman Dalva?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Yeah, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| I just wanted to raise the question because I thought, well, there's other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| It has wordsmithing changes to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Put them on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Give them to us as soon as you possibly can so that we can take a look at them between first and second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| and come up with wording that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| As effective, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Okay, so are we. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| I'm done with the first section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| We're on section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Okay, so let me move on to Councilman Dalva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| Councilman Wallace may then come back to you if you've got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| Well, the area that I think gives me great heartburn is the change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6706)|
| 1:51:54| Excuse me, Mr. Wallace, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| Can we go ahead and say are there any changes in section four, section five, section six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| so we can keep this in order instead of bouncing around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| You'll be fine with that if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| In other words, we just finished section two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Does anyone, if we can proceed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| Okay, we had section two, which were basically the definitions and. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| Section two was definitions, and if you've got some wordsmithing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| then give it to the law department as soon as possible so those can be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| Section three, prohibited signs, any. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Okay, are you. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Okay, Councilman Wallace will go ahead and do. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Okay, section three, prohibited signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Yes, and this pertains to, and I've had conversations with the law department on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| but under section three, this pertains to section three, four, five, and 8.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| Prohibited signs would be temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| They're going to be looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| We don't have an amendment to make for that tonight, but that is one area that's going to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| Are they all temporary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| And there will be certain ones that will be allowed, but that's why we'll bring that back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| but I just wanted to bring that up under section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Okay, that's just an FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| But it's not an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| It's just a FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| If it's not amendment, if you're going to bring it back and it's going to be a substantive change. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Then you'll go back to first reading if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Or bring it up at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| I mean, we can come back to it, you know, as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| You're going to look at it all the way through, as long as you're on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| That's what you promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Let's hold into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| I'm just here to repeat the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| As long as you have that spare guest room, we'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| Section five is the temporary signs, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Okay, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| So section. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Okay, anything on section three then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| And by the way, I just want to assure Will Johnson and Gerald Green that this is a typical meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| We do this every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| I'm so glad I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| Right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| Let's see what Will has to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| Mayor, can I ask section five seems to be the one that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| Section. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Let me. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Is there anything on section four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| He said section four, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| Anything on section four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Now we go to section five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Yeah, I'm a little confused by Duane's comment because I thought section five is the one that basically exempts most temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| That's the one that we're going to be looking at in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| Is it in section three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| It refers to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| It refers. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Temporary signs are referred to in section four, five, and 8.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| It's just referred in several places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| The temporary signs will be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| And you're right, Counselor, that we realize it has to go back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Anything on section five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| Section six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| I've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| For which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Section 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| I wish the two co-chairs would explain why we get into all the math of figuring out the vertical surface of canopies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| Can't we use the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Why is that like a two-part dance where you add that to the rest of the wall surface?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| I mean, isn't there an easier way to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| I can explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| There are stations in convenient areas that, for instance, you have a very small building that's underneath a very large canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6912)|
| 1:55:21| And so that's how that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| That gives you a bigger sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| It gives them a larger sign by allowing for the canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| The building itself might be real small, but the canopy is extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| Thinking of the one on Kingston Pike, for instance, there across from Long's Drugstore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| where it just has a very small building and it has the canopy all the way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| Usually that's in gas station areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| And so they're counting the canopy also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I thought you just described the Everly Brothers Park, but I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| That's the next block down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| The next block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| So you say that was considered and that's a reasonable thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| Section 7, General Sign Standards and Requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Any issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| Another dumb question for one of the chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| Section 7.6, why are we concerned with square or rectangular footprints under posts and poles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6968)|
| 1:56:17| I mean, what are we trying to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| We're trying to square up the poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| I just don't quite understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| That came about, if you consider, and not to be disrespectful of those people that have the pole signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| but basically the pole signs with a sign on it, we refer to them as popsicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| And so by having a rectangular or a square shroud around the pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| it gives it a more finished look and ties into the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| And what are you laughing for, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| You like pretty poles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| She's become delirious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| I mean, these are the kind of things that we got into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| She's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| She's become delirious now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| So that's the reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| If that's what you guys wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| Well, I think this is a point, back, for wordsmithing on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| and I will recommend that we work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| I mean, this is fabricating to decorate the pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| No naked poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| Naked poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| No naked poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| No naked poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| So think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| So this is fabrication to decorate that, and there needs to be further definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| than to go up to the bottom of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| I think there's stuff to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Okay, Section 8, Standards for Specific Sign Types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| Yeah, I think, and this will tie into back to 14 and the change of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7055)|
| 1:57:45| and how we define change of use, which is coming up later if we stay in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| But if we change the use, our electronic message center is also going to be illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| non-conforming, and they would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| Wait, you changed the number on the EMC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| If you change the use of the building, if you go from a restaurant to a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| are we going to have to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| And that's what I'm asking, and Krista and I have talked some about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| and I think she's got some work to do on that over last week's talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| If you change the use on it, I mean, EMCs are no longer permitted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| What if a Ford dealer becomes a Fiat dealer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| Is that a change in use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| Well, that's what we've got to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| That seems minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| That's what we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| So, I mean, that's coming up in change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| but I think it needs to be addressed in the EMCs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| So you're saying it's confusing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| I'm saying it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| Okay, so you're working with the law department on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| Working with the law department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Bring back a change, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| That could be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| I mean, really, Mr. Swanson, I think that part could be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| I think that could be substantive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| Do you have wording for changing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| Yes, I've prepared a potential definition to define change in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| which we'll be talking about when we get to Section 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Okie doke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Well, I think then it warrants discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| whether we want to allow that change of use to apply to EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| It does not now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| It does not apply now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| It would be a substantive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| and I think it really ought to be a discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| and see what we're in favor of and whether we want that to be or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| So that would be my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| It's not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| It would go on on that location, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| I think under the language per change in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| if there is a change in use as it's defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| I think they would have to take down the EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| How is it defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| I mean, today, without this ordinance passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Without this ordinance, they can continue to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| So I'm saying I would think that we needed to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| and, I mean, whether we want to allow that or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| We're still on Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| And we were told to wait until Section 14 to learn the answer to this puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| I thought, on what a change in use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| But I'm on Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Anything else on Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| I heard Ms. Malone speak, and heretofore, as I understood her comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| electronic message centers were allowed for commercial or was it commercial industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| and all of a sudden, it now reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| within all zone districts shall apply to EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| and the question is have we inadvertently broadened this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| or are we in love with EMCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| I don't know what the committee came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| but if we intend to keep them corralled in commercial and industrial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| why don't we say that somewhere explicitly that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| within all districts that allow EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| commercial and industrial zones, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| why don't we say what we mean there or we are opening a door we don't intend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| That should be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| So you need to add it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| So that's where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| About commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| 8.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| 8.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| The idea that where EMCs are allowed in commercial and industrial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| that might change in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| but the following regulations apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| Just limit it to its current what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| Usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| Since there was no intent to change EMCs was what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| How about if you had words there that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| within all zone districts in which EMCs are permitted or authorized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| Can you put it for ends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| Well, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Commercial and industrial until we change the statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| I guess you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| As a general concept for drafting language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| Keep it simple, stupid, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Where do we find the limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| Well, when you say within those where it's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| But where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| Well, you look and see where they're permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| and you look to the language about EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Krista, bail me out quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| So as it reads currently with this being the section on EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| an EMC could be permitted in any area that has the historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| or the downtown design overlay, regardless of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| Well, that says except.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| So what this is saying is EMCs that exist before this date that's listed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7355)|
| 2:02:42| are allowed to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| After that date, no EMC shall be permitted in any location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| except in these following instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| So we're talking about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Where would an EMC be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| This is a new place that we can only allow them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| So they're only allowed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| H1s and specific zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| H1s, I mean, there's a lot of residential districts that have H1s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| This 1 and 2 don't refer to the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| Those are overlay zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| So you just have a grandfather clause is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| No, this is talking about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| EMCs before that legally existed on April 10th continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| From here on out, only these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| New ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| That's what this is primarily addressing, 1, 2, 3, and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| So is it clear that that's what we're actually affecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| Remember the old keep it enforceable speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| Well, I think I spoke with Ms. Malone during the break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| and I think her point was that if you look at number 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| it's not making any reference to the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| And so a changeable price zone would be permitted in a commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| but a changeable price sign would also be allowed in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| So if you had a monument sign in an office zone that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| advertised a doctor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| then they could have an EMC below that with limitations on the square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| footage that would say, you know, botox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| So we are expanding it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| That's the danger, right, that we're expanding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| I think that was the point Ms. Malone was making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| If I could please speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| Not unless somebody calls on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| I would ask that she tell us in short form what it is we're doing wrong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| Because I heard the statement there were four things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| and that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| Quite a bit is the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| What are you doing wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| But you did some really good things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| Here's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| In talking with the law department, it turns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| and I asked one of my questions that I sent to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| is whether or not an EMC is considered an illuminated sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| And the law department thinks not, thinks it's its own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| So this clearly, even we're in an office zone where it says no illumination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| you have illumination because you remove the words commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| Furthermore, yes, if the zoning districts, C1, C2, C3, C4, listed EMCs or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7506)|
| 2:05:16| then you could do what Mr. Swanson is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| which is you look at the zone and is it permitted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| But EMCs are not mentioned in any of those zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| and in fact they are specifically prohibited in C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| So this is a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| I'm sorry, it's a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| And frankly, I don't even know what number three means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| I can read the words and tell you what each word means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| but I have no idea what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| Are we talking there in unified sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| We have a unified master sign plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| Is that what three is referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| I mean, this whole thing needs to be looked at very, very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| because it puts them, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| in every zoning district you have in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| I guess my question is, what are we trying to regulate from here on forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| And I want maybe the committee chairs to tell me what you think you're regulating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| and then we'll find words to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| Well, they're no longer permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| But if you have, you can't put one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| After April, no EMB permitted except for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| So if you have one in a C2 zone now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| and you want to change that zoning to C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| and you're saying it wouldn't be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| No, that's not what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I'm sorry, but it's not what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Well, then Krista can tell us what it says and what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| Part of it's going to be dealt with on whether it's a change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| whether you're going to allow it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| I mean, that's really one of the bigger questions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| and that we're going to have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| In my opinion, Mr. Swanson, we're going to take an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| I guess the statement is specific districts that allow EMCs, what are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| And I'm hearing that they're really not a specific reference we can go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| to find the answer to that, and so we have left ourselves ambiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| at least in subpart three, A3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| A letter or answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Well, I think at number three it's referring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| it says that allow EMCs with approved design regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| or guidelines subject to approval by the appropriate regulatory body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| for such a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| Well, who is that, MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| It would probably be MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| So I'm thinking of, for example, a planned residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| which incorporates commercial uses, at least in some parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| So you have that they create essentially the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| for that planned residential district and other types of districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| and they could put EMCs as something that would be allowable in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| Yeah, but we've added ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| So we should either strike three or we should say in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| and industrial zones and strike out all the zones that allow the blah, blah, blah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| and get rid of that and just keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| I mean, let's make sure that everyone knows where they're allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| and where they're not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| That's the comment anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| Let's have the law department work on it and continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| Right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Okay, so law department will be working on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| Is that going to be a substantive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| That was my comment for eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Not unless you want to do something different than what's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| If you're just trying to clarify what this actually says, we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| If you want to do something different than what's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| Well, when we get to 14.3 and the change of use definition, it's going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7717)|
