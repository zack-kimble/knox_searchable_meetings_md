| 0:03:03| You've been reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=183)|
| 0:03:15| We like those luncheons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| They're free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| Let me say thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve another year as your chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| I want to reiterate the fact that I had said last time that I would serve one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| I would consider serving another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| If you ask me to do so, I will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| But this will be my last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| And so August 31st will be my last term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| I will seek no other leadership positions after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| So I just wanted to make that public and make everyone know that I do intend to do what I said I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| So we will have a new chair after this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| We do have a lot of challenges ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| I look forward to working with you and the administration and the others as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| So now our next item of business is the selection of a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| And so let's begin in the first district for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Commissioner McKenzie nominates Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Commissioner Norman nominates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully request that my nomination be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| I had my light on a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| I was going to ask to repair a conversation that, in passing, a fellow commissioner had had with me expressing that same sort of content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=263)|
| 0:04:34| But we didn't discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| We didn't deliberate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| We didn't even really have any conversation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| And I appreciate people looking in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| And I think that I bring enough controversy to commission right now just sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| So I really would have liked to have said earlier on I would support the continuation of the two people in leadership here on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=292)|
| 0:05:07| And so please withdraw my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110901specialsession?start=307)|
