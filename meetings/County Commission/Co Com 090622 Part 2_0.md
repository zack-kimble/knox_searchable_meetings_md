| 0:00:00| Up to 15 days. They can issue it the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:02| They can do it contemporaneously, but they have, within 15 days they must file the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2)|
| 0:00:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7)|
| 0:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8)|
| 0:00:09| And then from there, of course, there are appellate remedies to the Supreme Court, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=9)|
| 0:00:12| Chairman Strickland has already sent a letter to the local DA asking for the potential for an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=17)|
| 0:00:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:20| Would a letter to the State Attorney General be, is it the same process or does 10 people have to sign on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:26| and ask the State Attorney General to open an investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| The State Attorney General, because of his own power and authority, can launch an independent investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| if he, in fact, feels there's merit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| Now, it's my understanding, just my basic research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| generally they would first defer to the local district attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| but since the local district attorney has already opined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| it's very conceivable that the State Attorney General will proceed on his own merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| But I can't speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| I really couldn't tell you what he'll do once he receives the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| Has the State Attorney General's office been contacted by anybody in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| Not to my knowledge and belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| I believe Commissioner Saunders amended his resolution to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| but that was held in abeyance at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| But no formal, I have not been asked to draft a formal letter for this Chairman's signature in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| I think we're kind of talking about civil actions versus criminal actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| and we're talking about testimony being used in one and not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| I think that the concern I have is not the testimony, it's the discovery of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| and how that's discovered and how it is going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| But I think that, you know, the only thing that this resolution does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| and one thing that really bothers me about this resolution is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| the Chairman has already went to Director Lockett and told him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| or requested him not to be a part of anything that the Commission is a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| and he's already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| And I see no need to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| I think Mr. Jarrett and the law department have done an exceptional job providing us with advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=119)|
| 0:02:07| and counsel even at the, you know, I mean, he's in a tough spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| and he's still giving us proper counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| And so I don't think we need to hire any outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| But I think the only thing this resolution does, other than repeating what we did two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| is potentially sending a letter to the State Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Is that the way you read it, Mr. Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| I believe the crux or the intent of the resolution is to essentially avail yourself of all legal options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| and that would certainly be one of the legal options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Commissioner Burroughs, your light's back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| First, Dave, I think I understood you to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| but I want to get it sort of on the record of the proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| that you really, like I do and like so many do, respect our Assistant Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| and what he has done and how he has helped guide us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| and that your intent referencing legal matters is simply to give the Chairman of the Commission a quick avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| when there is no alternative to use Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| Is that your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I just needed to get that on the record and wanted to make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| I think Commissioner Brad Anders did us a good service by pointing out that an ouster suit is civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| and another item might be criminal, and we've got to keep that straight in our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| Double jeopardy doesn't apply here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| but there is the question of whether testimony in one influences subtly testimony in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| There have been some weird cases in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| But I think an ouster suit has the great advantage of being fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| and that's why I hope we do go in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| because the speed with which we need to get this offending ethical matter out of Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| by removing the person responsible for it is the great item before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| more than any of these other matters, and that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| I just want one quick question, one comment and one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| Mr. Harmon just said that, you know, the ouster suit would be the fastest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| The fastest would be the Ethics Board, and I would like to question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| can anybody give us an update where they are at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| The Professional Ethics Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| The Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| They are confidential, and until such time as they either issue a hearing date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| or an alternative grant a continuance, they're not going to provide us with updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Just as a reminder, whether Mr. Lockett is here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| he is still legally responsible for all of the legal affairs of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| which means he is going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| I'm sure to have input as to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| He is going to continue to draw his salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| He is going to continue to drive his vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| He is going to continue to have his pension benefits, so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| and this could continue for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| I, too, am very pleased with Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| I don't want to leave the impression that I'm not, because I think he's given us very good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| I'm not in favor of removing him and putting someone else in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| That's not my intent at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| My intent, though, is, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| if you would be willing to amend your proposal to say that this board will send a letter immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:58| to the State Attorney General to look at an ouster suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| and including with that ouster suit the prompt suspension of the officeholder from office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| from receiving compensation, an expedited answer to our petition for removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and an expedited hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| I think the language would include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| So I know that we've talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| I just want to make sure that that's in there, but I think that that should be part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| and if for some reason we need to, I know that 10 commissioners could sign on as very interested citizens to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:37| So I'm wondering your thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| or do you feel that this is sufficient to have the State Attorney General get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| so that we can look at the ouster and also look at a suspension hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| I would accept the words that you've offered as an amendment to my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Well, that would be my suggestion is that we instruct this body, if it's voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| that this body, through our chairman, send a letter to the State Attorney General asking for this immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| And, again, the Attorney General is going to go at his own pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| and I think it sends the message that we're interested in getting something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Joe, if we have to do some outside hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| would you let us know as a commission who you're giving that business to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| Just keep us informed of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| I think it's important that we know just outside stuff that is farmed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| I'd like to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| You know, considering the gravity of the situation, first of all, I'm sure you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| if I suspicion there's even a modicum of a conflict, I'm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| And in terms of counsel, because of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| I think you should be actively involved in that decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Again, so there's no oar of impropriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| The only fortunate thing about not having any contacts in town or not having any allegiances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| I can be a little more objective, but, nevertheless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I'll rely on institutional memory to ensure that no one's engaged that could possibly be connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| or otherwise accused of having a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| And I'm talking about just this case, anything in the future that you have to hire out any extra help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| I just would be interested in knowing just, you know, what you're not able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| I'm not saying that you're not, but anything that you have to hire out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| I think this board would like to know how much business that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Because I've been asked by several citizens, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| how much are we farming out business to other attorneys and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Valid question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| You should always know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| And, again, I'm of the opinion that you've got a hardworking attorney staff upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Great professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| We shouldn't be hiring outside counsel because there's too much work, which so far has not been occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Unless there's a definitive conflict of interest, beyond that, we do it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| You know, you start floating, you know, $300 million bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| You don't want to play junior bond lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| But beyond that, certainly, in the event that, you know, at this juncture, I wouldn't be making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| But whoever is making that decision, I'll ensure that the board is apprised of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| And if you do have to hire outside and if you would put on there because, you know, we have a conflict here, just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| But my other question that I have for you is there seems to be two ousters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| An ouster suit from us and you've got citizens out here in the community that want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Are you saying with what Commissioner Hammond was saying that if we do an ouster, it would be quicker than citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Or is it the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| No, sir, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| I was under the impression that citizens were looking at recall, which is a totally different animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| which, of course, is an infinitely more complex, costly, and lengthy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| But ten citizens are ten citizens, and it wouldn't have any more merit, really, only in terms of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| if a court obviously sees ten clients seeking to rid themselves of their own attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| I think it would be difficult for a judge not to take due notice of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| But then again, a court should not think anything less of ten concerned citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| who likewise are taxpayers and are paying that salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| And I do want to reiterate that, you know, I have no problem with your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| You all have great workers and I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I'm going to try to keep this very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I wanted to go over real quickly again what you said the timeline was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| This is to Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| You said it was from the time that the petition is filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| And I believe the petition was filed at the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| You said it was 20 days from the time it's filed that the respondent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| or the law director would have the opportunity to respond to the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| They get 20 days to file a written response or, on the alternative, seek a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| And then assuming that there's no continuance, then in 15 days there should be a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| Or within 20 days a hearing time should be set, and that should be within 15 days of that 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Essentially, they normally won't set a hearing quicker than 15 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| so it has to be like day 16 forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Looking at this case, they'd probably do it with all deliberate speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| And then once a hearing is held, they have to file a written finding within 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| And then when the hearing is, like you said, so when the 20 days is up, that's his opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| Then they set a hearing date, which has to be within 15 days of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| They actually have the hearing, and then the discipline or the punishment is released 15 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| No, sir, it's a bit of an oddity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| The first 15 days is they won't set a hearing sooner than 15 days, so it would be day 16 or forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| Then, once the hearing is held, then they must, within 15 days, file a written finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| So once that 20 days to respond is over, we don't know how long after that that the hearing is actually going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| We just know it's going to be greater than 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Now, the next question is, let's say there is a punishment that involves either disbarment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| or a suspension of the license, which would affect his position here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| And he decides to appeal that, and it goes to an appellate court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Does that suspension take effect while the appeal is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| or does the suspension not take effect until after it's been heard by the appellate court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| Well, what they would seek is they would file an appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| and they would ask the court to stay the punishment until outcome of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| It would be up to the court to say, no, you're suspended, and if you win, you'll be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Or the court can say, sounds like you didn't get a fair shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| We'll hold it in abeyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| But generally, from what I've seen and the opinions I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| rarely do they allow someone to continue to practice during the suspension period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| The final question I have is that I've read in the paper that they found out there were additional loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| that were made by clients of his previous law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| Will they file that as an amendment to the petition for discipline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| And does that delay the process if an amendment is filed to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| I can't tell you whether or not they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| They're empowered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| They can amend that petition at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| But if they amend the petition, then you're entitled to an amended answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| which will then start the clock ticking all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Start the 20-day clock all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| The amendment that Commissioner Hammond made, Commissioner Mark Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:50| and Commissioner Briggs, you were the maker of the motion and the seconder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| Do you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| I agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I just want to make sure that I've got everything straight in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| We have kind of amended the statement to if we need outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| and it's necessary in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| we're allowing the Chairman to make that decision and go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| But it's not mandamus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| And then the amendments that Commissioner Hammond has clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| in terms of the ouster suit is in this resolution now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| The only other comment that I have to make is regarding the ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and to do an ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| we're going to have to present some form of evidence in that ouster suit in our request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| and it has to be some harm or breach done while he's been in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| which comes back to the merit issue we had the other night in terms of an ethical issue only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| a nondisclosure issue that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| And then we're going to have to ask ourselves, if we go forward with this, taking that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| will it reach the level of ouster from an elected office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| Will this breach of an ethics of lack of informing your client of a conflict reach the level of a breach of trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:41| so great that you can be ousted from office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| If they think that's a possibility, then we may have an opportunity, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| to be removed from office during a hearing or a trial of ouster to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| If the judge thinks, well, I want to hear the proof on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| the motion to suspend is just that, and the court can decide, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| we're going to let him stay in office during this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| So I want us to understand that on the vote on this ouster doesn't mean that five days after they take it under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| and file the suit that he's going to be gone based upon a motion to suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| That's going to be based upon what the merits are that we present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| or that is presented by the state in an ouster suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| and whether they deem that if proof, more probable than not, it's great enough to ask him to be suspended, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| So I want us to be clear, you know, that this is not a silver bullet either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| If we vote for it, as we know, we have ouster suits that are pending right now that are way old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| So we may have to live with this pill until justice is the wheels of justice turn slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| No matter how bad we want it to turn rapidly, something is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| but it's going to happen in the wheels of justice, however we take it, and it's not going to be expedient, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| So I just want us to understand what we're really getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| And if you want clarity on those statements, I'll turn it to the law director and let him clarify what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| I guess I was not clear that we were asking us to join an ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| I thought that we had asked basically just a little more detail that we asked the state attorney general to investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| If the state attorney general finds, as Mr. Jarrett said, finds reason to bring an ouster to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:49| My intent would be for us to send a letter to the state attorney general seeking ouster against Mr. Lockett, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Now, however, he would choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Well, that's the process that is prescribed that the state attorney general investigates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| And then if he finds cause, can bring an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| And that's what we would be directing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| As far as I can tell, what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Well, I guess I was looking for a little bit stronger language in telling him that we want an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| I mean, you know, he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I think we can ask him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I think realistically, and Joe might be able to help us with this, that he will rely pretty heavily on our district attorney locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| That's typically the way these things happen, or at least the attorneys I've spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| That's the sentiment that they have given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| So we can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| But we're not joining an ouster suit at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| I would be willing to join an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| That's not part of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| But that's not part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| No, part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| But if we vote it down, then I would be willing to be ten very interested citizens to go ahead and pursue that avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| So I could be clear, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Under the ouster statute, just so you know the grounds, knowingly or willfully commit misconduct in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon such officer by the laws of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| And then there are some others, and they are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Intoxication produced by strong drink or engaging in any form of illegal gambling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| any act involving a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| But the first two are very broad, as you can imagine, knowingly or willfully commit misconduct in office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| or knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| They're very broad and give a lot of discretion to the investigative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Sorry, Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| If we send a letter to the State Attorney General and he refuses based on just saying he's referring back to the local DA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| and, like Mr. Hammond says, he wants to join the House for a lawsuit, I'm thinking that comes out of his pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| I would not ask the citizens to pay for that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| No, that's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Whose pocket would it come out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| It comes out of the taxpayer's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| The DA has to proceed with it at the county's cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| I believe the question, though, was if the DA refuses, then, yes, you would be appearing as citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| If the DA refuses and you have the proper evidence, you can bypass the DA and go straight to the grand jury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and present your evidence if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Well, but, again, the grand jury is a criminal indictment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| They may refuse it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Then you would have to hire an attorney to proceed it on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| No, but just so we're clear, sir, the grand jury is meant for criminal indictment, not for civil ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| Well, the law, I believe, says that you can go straight to the grand jury to get a true bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| That's what we were informed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Also, Mr. Jarrett, when we met down there, Commissioner Armstrong was exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| We had to present evidence, and they told us no evidence would be used in the prior term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| It had to be for the time that they were in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| So we may be wrong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| If Mr. Lockett hasn't committed anything in this office, there's no grounds for ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Because they said it had to be during the tenure of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| No matter what he had done, if he had been elected before, no matter what he had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| if he had stole $100,000 off the account or $2 million, they could not use that to oust him if it was in a prior term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:34| My question was if the DA, the state DA, refuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| then the ten concerned citizens have to foot the bill for the attorney to put together the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Is that correct, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| I guess for the law director, the TBI is investigating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Yes, sir, but they're not investigating it in light of ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Are they not passing the information that they gather on to the state attorney general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| Well, they're passing it on to the special prosecutor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| to determine whether or not there are grounds for criminal sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Could that special prosecutor bring an ouster suit if they felt a need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| He would normally defer to the local attorney general, but as he's conflicted himself off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| yes, he can conceivably look at the evidence and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| I don't think it rises to a criminal indictment, but I certainly see ouster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| and then he can go right ahead and file an ouster suit if he desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Okay, but the information that the TBI is gathering is going to the special prosecutor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| not necessarily to the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Again, the TBI is a criminal investigative unit designed to assist the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| as to whether or not an indictment should be had before a grand jury for a criminal proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:08| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Our citizens want to know what we're going to do, so I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| Well, I don't see any other lights on, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1395)|

| 0:24:09| They're here, Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1449)|

| 0:28:22| One short thing I would like to say about visiting with Julie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and walking, like, through the lunchroom or down the hallways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| I guess it's with the little kids, they have to look up to you because they're little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| But the thing that impressed me most was that if it was just one little kid running down the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| the child had to stop and grab her by the leg and look up and get a pat on the shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| And there was interaction that I think really fosters an atmosphere of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| which allows the kids there at Carter Elementary to do their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| And it's in that spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I know sometimes it takes a dollar or two to make the experience run a little bit quicker or smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| I want to say that I have a dollar or two also to help you, your staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| and your students celebrate the accomplishments there at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| And, Julie, this proclamation from Mayor Ragsdale says the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| but it also proclaims June 22nd, Principal Julie Thompson Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| The unfortunate part is there's only six hours left in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| So if we could have done it at 2 o'clock, you'd have a little bit longer day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| I'd like to thank the Knox County Commission, Dave Wright, and Bud Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| for acknowledging my recent award from the Education Consumers Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| It's with great pride that I accepted the first place award for East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| on behalf of the staff and students at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and also on behalf of the Knox County school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| Excellence in education is something that doesn't come without hard work, dedication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| and a clear focus on our responsibilities of educating every child in our care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| I'm privileged to work with a staff that understands the need to come prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| to do their best work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Our children, parents, and society depend upon us to do whatever it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| to ensure that all children learn and learn well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| This award has recognized those efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and I would like to commend the staff and teachers of Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| that are with me at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| We've recognized them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Without their dedication and determination, this award would not have been possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:56| The Education Consumers Foundation Award has set the bar high for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Please know that we will continue to work hard to maintain that same level of achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and we welcome the accountability associated with this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| Again, thank you for acknowledging my achievement and that of my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| I'm proud to be the principal at Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| and I look forward to serving that community for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Ms. Thompson, I need your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| 6726 Little Flat Creek Lane, Coryton, Tennessee, 3771.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| Commissioner Hammond, is Laura Cole here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Ms. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Yes, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Ms. Cole, if you'd like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| We're going to number 17 under Other Business, number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| This is a discussion involving Laura Cole and runoff problems concerning her property in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Yes, Ms. Cole is here, and I'd like to just turn the floor over to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:32| Laura Cole, 316 Bob Smith Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:42| Two years ago, I came before this body to ask for help with stormwater runoff problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| Since that time, I've worked with Knox County Engineering, the Tennessee Department of Conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| and the Environmental Protection Agency in good faith in an effort to resolve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| Unfortunately, the problem continues, and so I'm before you tonight to again ask for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| I've passed out some pictures taken from 2006 to, well, the 21st of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:20| I'm going to repeat what I said to this body in April of 2007 when I was here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| because nothing's really changed and it's still relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| This is what I said in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| I'm here today to talk about stormwater, but I'm not going to go into the technical aspects of the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| I want you to see what stormwater runoff looks like from my back porch, and I want you to see what keeps me up at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| I want you to know that the stormwater ordinance is worthless unless it's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| Six and a half years ago, I bought a farm in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| I could have settled anywhere, but I picked East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| I don't know where I would have found such beautiful land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Because I'm familiar with environmental issues, I set out to do everything I could to protect the farm and the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| I worked with the Natural Resources Conservation Service and installed best management practices on my farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| I made sure the livestock was fenced out of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| I installed waters with erosion controls, a grassed waterway, and a stream crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| A short time later, my neighbor upstream decided to construct a high-density development next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| I was very concerned about the impacts of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| This area has a lot of steep ridges, sinkholes, hidden streams, limestone, and soils that erode very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| This plan called for 168 units on 69 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| I visited with MPC, Knox County Engineering, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to express my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:55| I even spoke with a design engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Everyone assured me that I would have no runoff problems with this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| and unfortunately, this development has gone like many others in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| The ridge was stripped, the landscape raised, and the growth policy recommendations were ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:14| In April of 2006, construction began and the muddy water invaded my pastures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| I have documented and filmed the pollution on my farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| I send many of you my photographs and videos, and I also send them to county and state regulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| The pictures you see today will show you what I see when it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| Keep in mind when looking at these pictures, 2000 and 2008 are considered drought years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| My farm will likely be destroyed within a few years, and I have few options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| I can sell or I can sue, and neither of those choices is a good choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| It's not a constructive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| We all say that we believe in balance between development and preservation, and this is not balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| This is destruction of one person's property for another's profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| There are more sites like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| They may be worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| What is certain is that this will continue unless we find within ourselves the political will to enforce the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| that are in place to protect the community from this kind of destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Commissioners, these were my words two years ago, and they're still relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| I really don't want to be here tonight bringing you yet another problem, but I'm compelled to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| What is happening to my property is wrong, and I'm here to stand up for my rights as a citizen and a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| And I would like to leave you with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| As you look at these pictures, if this runoff was on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| and your family's well water was at risk, what would you do about this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you, Ms. Cole, for bringing this again to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| This has been going on for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| I guess my question is, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| I mean, she's asking us for help and has asked us for help for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| Is there anybody in Knox County Government that can give us an answer to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:13| Well, if somebody from the city can come over and help us, let's get somebody from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| We could have adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| It's been Ivan Harmon out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Gray Rosenberg, Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| I'm not over stormwater, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| However, you know, I've been in contact with Ms. Cole several times over the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| before they even broke ground on the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and we've certainly had our share of problems with that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Our stormwater engineering department is aware of the issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| They are out there routinely, and we are in contact with Ms. Cole routinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| on the issues she's having with that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| and also in contact with the commissioners in that district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| So we're going to continue to monitor the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| and hopefully find some resolution to some of the issues she's having out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| That's all I can say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| I can't speak to the technical issues that are taking place because I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| I'm not in stormwater engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| However, I've been in contact with both our stormwater engineering department, Ms. Cole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| and commissioners to try to work through these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Grant, you brought up a very valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| If this were your property, what would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| She has very valid concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I know, but, I mean, she's brought it to us, and it's been two years, and here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I mean, is there nothing Knox County can do to protect this lady and her property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Well, we've issued notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| We've issued fines on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| We've followed our enforcement protocol, as far as I know, as well as we have, as well as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| Are you collecting any fines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| I'm not saying there's an easy answer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| So we just passed this big stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Does not the law allow escalating fines for each day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| And has that technique been employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| I missed your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| That's quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| I believe that the law allows escalating fines based on each day of noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| Have we done that as a sort of stick to move this developer toward resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| Because it seems to me if we just make a little fine and then don't go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| they're just going to accept it as a cost of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| And I don't have a file with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| I don't know the entire enforcement history and what level of fines we've given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| and what level of enforcement Knox County has given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Because, again, Chris Gronju is our stormwater director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| He has all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I'm just kind of filling in because he's not here, just speaking to some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| because I'm somewhat familiar with some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| So the most we could do maybe is pass a resolution encouraging or I suppose could we require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| Bruce Weitrig and the folks at engineering to enforce escalating fines on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| as a means of prompting action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Could we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Theoretically, I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| That's the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I'd like to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| We are limited as to what we can fine per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| And per violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| But we have issued those fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| I know in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| I know we have issued fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I don't know the level of fines or how many we've issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I just don't have that information with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| How long do we fine before we take legal action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| I mean, is there no protocol set up for this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Just being honest with you, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Again, I'm not in stormwater engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| I'm over code enforcement and zoning enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| And I know with regard to zoning and codes enforcement, I mean, there is no set time when we take legal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| It just depends on, you know, the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| It's usually a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Well, this is not the only place in the county that this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| And I think we need to get the proper folks in here at the next meeting to discuss this in depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:08| and determine some ways that we can do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| You know, I look at these pictures, and it's a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| And I say it's not the only place that's happening, but that's a very, very serious violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| Now, normally when a developer builds like this, they have to put a retention pond in that can hold supposedly any runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:34| for X number of hours, days, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| Evidently, this is not being done in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| So what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| If fines don't work, you've got to come to a point where you shut somebody down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| I mean, that's that simple to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| And a lot of that water retention is generally post-construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| I think a lot of the issues we're having are actually during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| And the way the economy is and the way a lot of subdivisions are across Knox County right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| we have a lot of subdivisions that are half built that are still under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and will be under construction for some time now because, you know, developers are running out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| And, you know, development is taking so long that you're having a lot of these erosion control issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| Mr. Chairman, would it be in order that I make a motion that we direct the powers that be to be here the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:27| to be on the agenda for this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| So I'll also make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I've just got a few things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I have been to Ms. Cole's farm on more than one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| And as has been stated before, it's not the only rodeo in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| And we've got a lot of approvals for development that is failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| And I don't mean just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I mean a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I know Ms. Cole's situation personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I know that from an environmental standpoint when she started her farm and what she did with her farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| and what she said about her farm is not rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| She has gone way out of what I would think most normal people would even know to do to keep her water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| and streams pure from her own activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| And then we as a community allow activities on neighboring property that has literally devastated that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| Now, I have talked with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I have talked with stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| I have talked until I'm over talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| And there's a few things we're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Number one, we've talked about even stream restoration in her case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| And I want them to come before county commission with some answers because I've talked to them personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| and I have gotten to a certain degree what I thought, okay, we're moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| we're going to be able to do something, but nothing ever happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| The second thing is that we need to look in the future before we approve development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| And I am not anti-development, but if our best management practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| and what our engineers are proving now keep failing like they're failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| we're going to have to do a better job on the front end because it is killing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| On Father's Day, I was standing out in the rain in six inches of mud in a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| where people couldn't even get out of their own homes because of a development failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| with bales of hay and riprap washed out into the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Now, there's something wrong with our technology and our approval of technology when you have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| And I can't tell you how many times the taxpayers, us, have had to go out to some of our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| and clean up these failures at taxpayers' expense to help people get in and out of their own homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| So it's not just Ms. Cole's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| It is Knox County's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| And it's going to be incumbent upon us, and I think Commissioner Hammond is in the same wave as me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| we've got to do something, and I don't want to say drastic, but drastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| And we owe some correction to where the harm has come from our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| We've got to give these people some relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| And I really want the people from engineering and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| and stormwater to be able to come here and address the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| and what we can do and advise us what we can do to make this quit happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| Because I cannot tell you how many days we have been standing in neighborhoods, in the rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| watching the mud flow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I'm not talking muddy water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| I'm talking mud flow down the hills into other people's property and other people's things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| and ending up in other people's houses, on other people's carpets, and et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| because somebody is making a dollar at other people's expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| And we've been misled to a certain degree that we have the technology that we can do these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| and it works out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Well, right now, we don't have the technology or we're not doing it right because it's not working out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| And I've asked and I've had meetings and I've called meetings with stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| and everybody's tried to play fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| But fair play is about over because we're not doing the right thing with our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| when it comes to development, at least in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| And I'm sure that we're not the only game in town that's failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| So we as a community are going to have to stop and rethink our, yes, this is okay, it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| And I'm really scared to death about phase two in this development that we've got coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| because the slopes are steeper and the potential harm is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| And we don't have the easy one fixed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| And there are streams on that other side in the rain right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| In the rain, you can dip the water out and you can drink it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| But that's before phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| In phase one, before phase one, you used to be able to do it on Ms. Cole's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| But you can't even see the waterbed anymore because it's silted up so bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| and it floods so bad and the mud flows so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| And I don't even own the property and I'm over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| So we as Knox County need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| And I'm begging us to try to really look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And I thank you, Commissioner Hammond, for coming on board up front with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| and being concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| But whatever we've approved is really not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| or we've got to break down somewhere, whether it's either in our technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| or our enforcement, but something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. Arms, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| We're planning, hopefully in August, with CTAS, County Technical Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| a workshop we'll invite MPC, County Commission, and BZA to look at how we go forward in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| And I don't want to be defensive of staff, but once these are approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| and I think you hit the nail on the head, once they're approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| all the problems come back to reflect on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| And there's only so much we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| We're meeting next, the mayor's meeting with Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| and James McMillan next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| We'd be glad to invite Ms. Koh to that very meeting and look at what we can start doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| But once the, I think it's clear to say, once the development has been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| remediation after that is going to cost taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| There's only so much we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| And some of these fines are at such low levels that a developer can almost take the fine and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So we're going to have this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| We'll invite Ms. Koh to this meeting with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| And we realize it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I think Ms. Koh can verify how often our stormwater people and Koh's people have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| Mike, I agree with you that we've got a harm now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| And we need to be looking at what our remedy is going to be now for the people that are already damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Because our decisions have helped result some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Now, the other side, you know, we're saying it's going to cost taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| Well, it's going to cost somebody money somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| I'm not necessarily saying it's going to be taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| But we need to get this property and some other properties back right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| And I think we're on the, I'm not knocking the staff, but I'm saying whatever, we're doing something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| And we're not being able to overcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| And I'm tired of it just going on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| This is two years here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| And the other one that I looked at is over a year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| And I've been out there eight or ten times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| And nothing is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| But I appreciate the August thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| But I'm thinking tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| We're meeting Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| Is it Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| I know it's this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Thursday at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| One other point that Grant alluded to, which is something we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| a lot of these developments are under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| and they have different requirements under construction versus completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| where they're supposed to fix all their remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And we've had these issues with developers who are just out of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| and the construction job is halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| I mean, we've had complaints about people who bought a home a year and a half ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| and there's four other houses that are under construction that have stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| and weeds are growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And we're trying to deal with those developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| and they're on the verge of bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| And the last thing they're concerned with is coming over and mowing the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| So that's another issue we're going to deal with that's closely related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| What happens when you're on a construction schedule for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| and suddenly because of the economy you're almost at a dead stand still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| You know, you need a remediation pond and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| You just don't have the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Maybe we need bigger bonds on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| We've got to change our policies and how we're doing this some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| And those are some of the things we're going to discuss at that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| But we will meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| We'll schedule a meeting with Ms. Coe and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| And I know we may be able to propose some remediation issues that may cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| And nobody knows better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| I mean, Mr. Granger is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Mr. Weitrich is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| But nobody knows better about the types of things that they would be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And Ms. Coe does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| And so, Laura, would you mind answering a few more questions probably from several of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| I just wanted to say that in the process of a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| in the process of developing the stormwater ordinance, we make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| We are doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| It's better than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| And certainly even we're better than the city in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| Every time you go outside, if you look out of our office and look at the Tennessee River after rainfall, it's orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| It's orange because every creek and stream in Knox County is in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| And that means we are not even close to sequestering all of these soil particles that are being washed into our streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:41| We're not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Our stormwater ordinance, in the process of developing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| one of the provisions that did not get written in was a yearly review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| I'm going to request or I'm going to make a resolution in the next month that we have a review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| a formal review of the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| And that may be some helpful in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| It doesn't address Ms. Coe's problem in the near term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| I've been to Ms. Coe's property a number of times as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| I've talked to Ms. Coe a dozen times probably about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| I've talked to Mr. Grandjew a dozen times about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| I share the same frustration as you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| The gatekeepers, the people that are supposed to prevent this, we are them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation, they are supposed to be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| It's not getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| And so we approved, since I've been in office, we've approved dozens of stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| or covenants with new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| I think they're all deficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Every single one of them that comes out is deficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| And those are going to be serious problems, even bigger problems in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| because of some of the shortcomings in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| I know you've got more to say, Ms. Coe, and you probably want to keep your statements brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| There's a couple of things that I wanted you to, and you can add anything you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| anytime you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| I did want to, in the process of looking at your pictures, it looks like over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| and I call it a four-year issue more than a two-year issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Isn't that really true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| They broke ground in 2006, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| There are times, you've had periods where probably during the drought period in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:49| were there times where the runoff seemed to be not as difficult as others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| Now, we've got a wet period this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| This is a relative, well, not really wet, but a normal rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| It's a normal rainfall spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| It feels wet because it's in comparison to the drought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Over that period of four years, do you think now that we've got kind of a blowout situation again of some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:20| I assume that everything's vegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| Everything pretty much at the site is revegetated with grass and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| For the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| There are a couple of sites under construction that are bare, but for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| So how do you get, in your estimation, where are the particles coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| If everything's vegetated and you get orange water in your creek, how is that possible in your estimation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:49| I think there's a couple of things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| As the sites changed over time, there's always been a particular problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| At one point, the entrance of that site, we've always had runoff problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| It goes directly into the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| It's still being routed there, and it needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| For some reason, it hasn't been repaired, but we talked about that in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| Another problem is a site was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| A temporary sediment pond was filled in, and in the process of filling that in, they filled in a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| And a lot of the water now is being routed to a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| And it goes underground and comes back up again in a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| So that's just two of the problems that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| But as the site changes, you change the hydrology, and you could add another problem, change the direction of the flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:46| But there's several things going on, some related to surface water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| some related to surface water that's not being properly routed to a retention pond or detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| And then some where water has actually been illegally routed to a sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| and is now going underground and eroding what I assume is fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Dr. Harmon alluded to the sort of accelerated penalty phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| and I know that's a difficult thing from your experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| It's difficult from an evidence standpoint to really put the, you know, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| well, we're going to, this is where it's coming from exactly, without a doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| because there are these underground systems and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| Do you have any, in your experience, do you have any suggestion for if it was you in the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:43| in the Knox County Stormwater Department, what would you do as an employee of that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| given you've got your situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| I'd be out there in my boots on the ground when a rain event occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| I would not wait until a sunny day a week later and come out and see if there's any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| So you've never had a county official there during a rain event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Shortly around rain events, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| But not really, we have a big rain, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| But I have to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| And I spoke with an EPA, our region four representative in enforcement, Umberto Gonzalez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| and he told me that you definitely have to be there when it's raining to see it because it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| It flushes through and you don't really see, you can't find where it's coming from unless you're there when it hits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| Well, that doesn't seem like that would be that difficult of a task for the county to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| if we requested that our stormwater department have some people there during an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:45| It's raining a lot right now, and it's raining between 8 and 5, and we could request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| And I will personally try to make that happen with Mr. Grandjou and see if we can't get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3532)|
| 0:59:01| if that's something that one little brick in this, or one little piece in this puzzle that might be helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| I'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| There is something else I wanted to say regarding escalating fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| When I spoke with the EPA representative, he told me that often fines don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| Developers become accustomed to that as a cost of doing business, and they take the hit and keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| And it takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| You know, in defense of those who are trying to enforce these laws, it takes a long time to get a lot of paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| and they're chasing their tails sometimes trying to get these fines paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| But he did tell me that he thought the most effective enforcement was a stop work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| That gets their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| That gets them their stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| They can't go any farther until they correct the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Is there work being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Is there work being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Is there work being done now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| What is the type of work that's being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Well, there's homes under construction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| There's maybe three, two or three right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| It's going very slowly right now, like everything else is in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Are the sites in your estimation, the sites that are under construction, are they properly protected in terms of erosion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:19| I haven't looked at every site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I tend to stick to the ones that are close to the property line because I'm uncomfortable about going across the construction sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| But I can tell you that the one that is causing the biggest problem right now in terms of runoff is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| There are some issues with the stormwater controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| It's not the sites that are under construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| It is the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| It is the sites under construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| I was just going to make a statement as she asked the question, how would we feel if this is our property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| And I think most of us would be very disturbed if this was happening to a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| particularly one that we were trying to manage in a very environmentally friendly way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| I think that what we probably need to do is, first of all, not let this just slide under the radar screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| and then another two years she's coming back with this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| But seeing what we can do either with ordinances to solve this problem, because this is a problem all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| It seems like about every two months I get a call from someone even out west where there's a lot of construction going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| on this issue and whether we need to, as I think Commissioner Brown said, to put a larger bond on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:37| So if they need to build retention ponds where the stormwater is not being properly controlled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| there will be the financing to do it or to insist that there's a certain amount of capital that the builders have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| and they can't say, well, it's a slow economic time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| And then finally, you know, we're spending an awful lot of money on trying to get rid of a law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| We found there was a couple of hundred thousand dollars taken out of the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| And I think if we're going to put up with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| the least we can do is to try to do something positive and protect the citizens and their property when something like this comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| and maybe even as we approve these different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| And I am very developer friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| but we absolutely have to protect people that have property adjacent to the developed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Mr. Arms, this is sort of recap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| I want to make sure I've heard a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| There's no need to speak to the issues again because I believe all the issues are in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| But on this specific property owner and this property, something will happen during this month, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Maybe Chris will review the fine history and the violations we've gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| Chris Cronjie is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| He's been on site several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| But what I'm more interested in hearing is what we will hear at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| We can promise you recommendations at the next meeting, some possible actions that could lead to solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| If there's nothing you can implement in between, that will be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| I would like to see some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| And you're hearing some other things that our staff agree with, bigger bonds up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| You know, we're dealing right now with developers that have gone out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| and they didn't have the bond money up front or the capital up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| And, of course, that's tougher on development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| But I'd like for Chris just to give you a two-minute update on what he's been doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| And maybe then we need more than just the administration speaking to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| Maybe we need the developer speaking to the problem next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| How do we go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| We need to hear them say what they think they're doing right or what they might be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:08| We can always ask the developer to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| I appreciate that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| Would you name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Chris Grangeau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| I guess it would be 205 West Baxter Avenue, County Stormwater Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| I don't have a scintillating summary here of our fines issued and notice of violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| You can rest assured many have been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Fines have been issued, and in response, a lot of action has been done on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:48| We've seen a lot of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| I apologize for being late on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| I was told we were starting this at 6 o'clock, and so I missed the beginning of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| But there were a lot of problems early on in the Graysburg development that the developers did remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| At the same time, we were doing a lot of the improvements to our stormwater enforcement program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| getting our stormwater ordinance in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| They gave us a lot of the tools that are necessary to do the enforcement that I believe you all are asking for in a general sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| Some things that might be relevant for you to think about in response to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| It's a very good point about the effectiveness of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| Civil penalties is what we issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| If you have somebody who has no money, getting money that would be used to effect repairs on a construction site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| may not be the best use of their resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| It's a problem that talking to the same person with EPA, it's a problem that persists throughout the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| You have developers who are overextended, walking away from construction sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| or foreclosed banks who aren't able to make repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| In some cases, entire construction sites have been abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| In some ways, we're doing a lot better here in Knox County than we could be if we were, say, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| In response to these issues, one thing that I think is important to know is to talk about bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| Bonds are a very important tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| One of the changes that we've made in our process, in our program, is to require a grading bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| basically an environmental bond, which is in addition to the bond that ensures that roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| and drainage structures are constructed correctly on a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| But this bond would actually cover the cost for reclamation and doing repairs on a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| However, that process doesn't engage retroactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| So what we're dealing with right now is this and many other sites where we have a limited set of tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| because the tools that we've been working on the last few years are simply not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| were not in effect at the time these projects were permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| We have as-built requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| We have, without going into too detailed a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| we have a lot more stringent requirements for verifying controls are in place and controls are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:33| And we also have an inspection protocol that helps catch issues that could exist on a site like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:43| a lot earlier in the process than may have happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| At the, right now at Graysburg, the outstanding enforcement case seems to be revolving around a single house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4068)|
| 1:08:00| construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| They have basically a yard that's not stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| They have dirt that's stockpiled in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| They do have erosion controls and it's simply a matter of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| It's time for them to get grass on the yard and for that they'll be receiving another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:25| I think they've actually received a civil penalty and they'll be receiving another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| The site itself, by virtue of the controls that are in place, appears to be compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:40| So one of the things that we are looking at, I think I've spoken with some of you about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| is we're actually considering, we've talked to some folks at the University of Tennessee to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| source tracking of sediment, basically putting something in the sediment where you can trace the sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| from the construction site to Ms. Cole's property or the stream downstream to try to get an idea of really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| where this sedimentation is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you, Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| I just want to emphasize that I totally agree with what all the other commissioners have said on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| And I have requested a meeting with our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| It's 3 o'clock this Thursday, the 25th, in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| And I believe you're going to be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| And I think we also have TDEC that's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| We have Bruce Weedrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Everybody that I know of that we've called in for Knox County to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| I've known James McMillan all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| And I'm very aware of his family farm that's been in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| His love and the love that that family has and has always taken very good care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| And they've got well water that his brother, that's the only means that he has of getting water into his house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| that they can't drink because of the muddy water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| That's from a development that's going on over off of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| I've also had people call me that live up on the top of Black Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| All of you all there are familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| That's going out before you get to the top, going up the hill toward Hall's community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| They have seen the McMillan farm and all this development from all the way up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| They have called and said, what in the world is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| It's nothing but a big muddy mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| So I know how much McMillan and how everybody else cherishes and loves your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:49| And I do believe that Knox County is failing our Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| in making sure that we are taking care of their property and keeping it up, and especially these farmlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| James McMillan is probably, I guess, one of the only farmers I've known from the time that I've grown up as a little boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| And that's all he's ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| So I'm in with making sure that Knox County, that we do what we need to do as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| to make sure that these people's properties are maintained and cared of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| We've really got two problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| The problem we're trying to deal with here is trying to put a Band-Aid on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| And it's going to be a costly Band-Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| It's because things were not done right in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| And that's the big problem right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| The developers who fly with the seat of their pants come in, do a skimpy project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:57| Whoever sets, you know, maybe we need to look at the protocols that are set up up front on what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| if this water goes here or if this road goes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Most developers are not held responsible for a lot of the infrastructure work that happens around the particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| They build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| They come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| They make their dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| And they leave the community with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| And then they're up here saying, okay, Mr. Commissioners, we need you to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| Come out and give me a Band-Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| I agree that it's going to have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| And the longer we let it wait, the more it's going to cost to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| If we can put some teeth in these things, like putting stop work orders instead of fines, as was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| sometimes the developers count this as part of the cost of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| That's another fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| So what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| But if they do have to stop work on it until something is fixed, then I think we can get to see more solutions to our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| So we need to work on two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| We need to work on fixing these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| We also need to work on this meeting that Mr. Arms mentioned a while ago in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| where we can sit down and make some rules and regulations that can prevent this stuff up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:17| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Chris, can you talk to me just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I'm not one to put you on the spot, but I guess I'm going to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| I don't see any other way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| We've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| We've jumped up and down together about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| We've been on the phone about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| We've talked about solutions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| And I was going really good until we made one statement a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| This house that we've got up here in Graysburg right now, it's a real slow construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| Is that what you're telling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I mean, it's like three or four years old and it's starting to leach now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| or is this like how long they've been building that house that's causing this trouble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| You know, to be honest, I don't know the date they pulled the building permit on it, but it's not that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:07| It's fairly recent, within the last six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| So the pictures that I've been getting before that has nothing to do with that house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| I just want to make sure we're on the same page when we come to start talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| I'm not going to be pointing fingers about who did what right or who did what wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| I mean, we're all in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| We're all in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| We've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| We need to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| We need to get that stream fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| We even talked about stream restoration, you and I, did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| You were going to check into that for me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Still am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| And we need to get some progress reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| We need to work on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| And I don't think we're in an adversarial relationship, are we, you and I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| We're all working for the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| So I guess I just want to make sure that when we come together, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| Arms, and we're all on the same page, we're all going toward the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| and we're going to reach some kind of solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| But these new houses are add-on problems to what we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| They're not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| And I think we even talked about tracing this root cause analysis, if you will, through soiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| just like you mentioned earlier, at this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| So I do know that the technology we use fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| I've been to three or four different locations in the past week that I don't mean fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| It's like nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Hay bales floating down the roads, riprap chasing after it, mud on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| So I guess what I'm saying is our technology, even as we accept it, is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| So as an engineer representing us, I want you to be able to come to the table pretty soon and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| you know, think outside the box for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Say, Bud, here's what we can maybe do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| I'm talking technologically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| I'm talking where your strength is to help solve our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| And I appreciate what you do, but I think we need to look harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| And I'm going to help you if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Similarly, Mr. Granger, we've talked a bunch about Ms. Cole, and I think you're in a very hard spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:29| And as with Mr. Armstrong, we would like to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| And I think that you know probably a way or ways that we can help in terms of the county's problem with stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:44| and the ordinance as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| So, for the record, this body is willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| And I don't know whether that's any assurance to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| It is an issue to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| We're going to, if we had to take a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| it would probably be a 16 to 2 type vote that we want to equip you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| and empower you to do whatever that you need to do to help preserve the creeks and streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| and the waters of Knox County, which are the waters of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| And so I want to say that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| And then on the short end, Ms. Cole had a request that I think you can grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| and that is that could we supply some of your people during a rain event directly for her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| you know, during one of these rain events that we're having so regularly here shortly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| Yeah, well, that's a tough promise to make because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| No, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| You can do this, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| There's acts of God involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| But there's lots of acts of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| There's a whole bunch of them that have been happening here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| We've, in all seriousness, we have tried to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| and I think Ms. Cole and I finally got in sync with it in one of the last rain events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| not this in the last week or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| but over the last month when we were actually able to get somebody on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| You know, in all seriousness, it's tough to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| but that's exactly what we're trying to do, too, because we take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| You're going to do your best at making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| We have a motion on the floor to request the stormwater management to attend the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:48| Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Caringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| Is that a factor that he's already been here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| All for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| We still want that, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| We want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| We can go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| We don't need a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| I'd like to have you at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Can we take five minutes before we start zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| You know, I wanted to speak to 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:28| If we could, and I know I've been holding the Chief of Staff up for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| so I can either speak to it now or we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:45| We're supposed to start zoning at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| How long is yours going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| It won't take me long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| I don't know about Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| It won't take me 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| Commissioner Hammond, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| It won't take me long either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Put us on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| You don't want me to put you on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| Mr. Chairman, I wonder if it would be possible to put these discussions at the end of our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| because people are up here for zoning and a lot of these discussions are different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Well, you know, we really spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Come on, make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Let's go on to 915 because we can be through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| This is a resolution asking the Knox County Legislative Delegation to hold a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| forum, and not full on any bill in the General Assembly that seeks to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| clarify, or modify the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Seven-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Seven-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Okay, Commissioner McKinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| And I know Commissioner Hammonds has his reasons, but what I'd like to do is request something as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| And this is, again, as we kind of got an assault on our charter during this last legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| we gave our lobbyists something, some actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| And I guess I'd like to get a report from, I guess, all three of our lobby entities in Nashville as to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| and this would be great to have before the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| What I'd like to see is a detailed list of which representatives they spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| and kind of a one-sentence synopsis on their stance on this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| We instructed them, we instructed the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| and he agreed to go out and ask our lobbyists to campaign on us against passes of this assault by Representative Faulkner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:49| to kind of bypass the Knox County process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| So if I could get that, I would greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| And just very briefly, frankly, I'm told by members of the General Assembly that our lobbyists did very little on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| and that's why I would be very interested to see that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| So, you know, you hear things, but I would just like to know because we did direct them to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| and from what the feedback I'm getting is that it just basically didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| Also, the only thing I'd like to add to this, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| is in addition to our sending a letter to the Knox County Legislative Delegation with this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| that we also send letters to the leadership of the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| which would be the House Speaker and also the Lieutenant Governor as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| so that they're in the loop and they know that if something like this does come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| that they know that our legislative delegation will be asking for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| and perhaps they would be in support of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Do we have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Makers of the motion accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Commissioner Norman and Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| We need to take a five-minute break before zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Just five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5020)|

| 1:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Members of the Commission, this is an item before you that probably all of you are somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| It's been before you in two or three different, slightly different forms over the past two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| The applicant today is presenting a plan amendment and a rezoning for property located on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| south side of John Sevier Highway, east of Winkle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| The property is also to the west of the intersections, approximately a little over a mile from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| intersection of John Sevier Highway and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| The applicant submitted an application to MPC for consideration of a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| change from low-density residential to medium-density residential and a companion rezoning for PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:56| plan residential and, as the application stated, nine dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| Staff looked at this proposal considering, in some ways, previous requests that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| been made for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| This is actually a smaller version of property that I believe was considered by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Contains roughly 21 acres, almost 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| It is located on the south side of a major arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| Staff in looking at the application for the plan amendment noted several things that led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| to their recommendation to approve the applicant's request or to recommend approval of the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:46| General plan policy 10.9 states that in establishing land use patterns, you should avoid creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:55| zoning boundaries that result in unlike uses facing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| If you take a look at your map, either the zoning map or the plan amendment map, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| notice that on the north side of John Sevier Highway, you have medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| as a plan designation for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| You also have plan residential zoning at one to eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| That's a little bit less than what the plan shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| But you do have a pattern established on the north side of John Sevier Highway, roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| on the opposite side of the road from this development that shows medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| So you have a general plan policy consideration if you're looking at amending a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| that you maintain like uses facing like uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| General plan policy 11.2 states that medium-density residential densities are appropriate in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| plan growth areas identified on the urban or the growth policy plan, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| Knox County and the town of Farragut have agreed to and adopted several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| The plan growth area, as opposed to the rural area, anticipates a little more intense level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| of development because it is plan growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| It is that first ring of development intensity that you have outside of the urban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| And it anticipates that versus the rural area, you are going to have a little bit more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| development take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| So the plan growth area, the general plan policy, consistent with the intent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:38| plan growth area, identifies MDR densities as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| Also too, they also identify MDR densities appropriate along arterial streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| And John Sevier Highway is a state highway, which is comparable to an arterial street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| on our major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| The property itself is a little more than a mile to the intersection, to the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| of the intersection of John Sevier and Chapman Highway is approximately six-tenths of a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| to where the intense pattern that you see around that intersection begins, where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| have medium-density zoning under the RB zone and commercial zoning prevalence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| So you have it very close to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| And it is an urban pattern surrounding that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| And as it turns out, that intersection as well as much of the property to the east and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| north side of John Sevier Highway is shown in the urban growth boundary, which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| urban area that is at the center of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| So you're in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| You're already designated plan growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| You're right across the highway abutting the urban growth boundary, which is the most intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| of the designations on the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| And you are very close within a half a mile to a mile to the commercial node at Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:15| John Sevier Highway and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| There was a lot of testimony at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| Applicant and those in opposition presented their findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| The Planning Commission, first of all, approved a resolution recommending that the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:36| adopt by resolution the amendment from LDR to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| And that was by a vote of eight to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| And after a lot of discussion, several failed votes, instead of approving the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:54| or supporting the staff recommendation of rezoning at plan residential at nine dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| units per acre, they voted to recommend that you approve plan residential at 7.5 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:06| units per acre by a nine to five vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| Does the opposition or the applicant want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| You get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| I'll let the opposition speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| I need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| My name is Bob Dykes, 7544 Galleon Lane, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| I'm speaking on behalf of the South Dole Homeowners Association, and we ask that you vote no to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| the proposed sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| The applicant currently has zoning appropriate for his original project, which was approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| 80 condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| That's now up to about 110 based on additional property that he's purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| That zoning is LDR, five units per acre, and was changed from agricultural with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| opposition from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Excavation work is actually started about two years ago, but it was not completed, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| now it's causing stormwater runoff concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| This LDR zoning was consistent with the character of the neighborhood, and most importantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| for us as a community, the condo project is consistent with the South Knox County sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| plan adopted and currently in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| We're here today not to object to a development on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| We still encourage the developer to proceed with his plan to build high-quality condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| utilizing his proposed concept of low-impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| We are objecting, however, to what we consider an inappropriate, unwarranted, and incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| change to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| As we pointed out to this body before, this sector plan is the product of long hours and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| hard work on the part of literally hundreds of South Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| We recognize what it is and appreciate how it's supposed to be used to guide the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| of the land in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| We understand how it's supposed to work in concert with the designation of this portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| of Governor John Severe Highway as a Tennessee State designated scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| The sector plan has served the entire community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| Without this proposed amendment, it is not wrong, it is not flawed, and it should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| be changed in the way it's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| As we have argued here before, this proposed change to the sector plan is nothing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| than spot zoning, which the sector plan was designed to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| The original proposed condominium development is consistent with the existing sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| is consistent with the surrounding neighborhood, and it's acceptable to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| The sector plan should not be changed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| If it needs to be reviewed and changed, there is an appropriate process for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| There are specific criteria set forth for changes, but this change does not meet any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| of those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| We believe that MPC failed in at least three significant ways to follow proper procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| in this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| First, MPC did not provide a proper public meeting or hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| Second, MPC did not give meaningful consideration to the Governor John Severe Highway status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| as a state-designated scenic highway or to the sector plan provisions related to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| And thirdly, MPC did not state sufficient grounds for their eight to six vote in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| You have those three errors, if you will, are explained in detail in the email that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| you were handed just a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| Let me go through each of those briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| Public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| MPC's statute requires a public hearing prior to votes on sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| MPC's own regulations require that MPC staff, quote, shall incorporate the results of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| or more public hearings on all applications for sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| No public meeting was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| Scenic highway status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| As I mentioned earlier, the Tennessee Scenic Highway System Act designates the stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| of John Severe Highway between Alcoa Highway and Chapman Highway as a Tennessee rural scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| The Act states that its purposes and specific objectives include the recovery and conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| of natural scenic beauty along such highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| The Wells Creek property fronts directly on the designated stretch of John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| The South Knox sector plan reflects and expands upon the Act specifically as to John Severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| The plan states that the highway's rural scenic status mandates that development along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| edge of the corridor be severely limited to include increased building setbacks, reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| signage, and limitations of the intensity of development located along the road to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| greater protection of the scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| Further, the plan specifically calls for preservation of the historic area around the home of Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| John Severe, which lays less than half a mile west of the Wells Creek property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| The MPC staff report makes absolutely no mention of the scenic highway or the provisions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I will point out that currently in the zoning of that entire area, there's no MDR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:27| All property in that area is either agricultural or low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| Number three, insufficient grounds for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| The sector plan amendments may be made only according to specified criteria and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:40| MPC General Plan 2033 provides that amendments must be justified by either logical extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| of existing zoning or development patterns which are consistent with the policies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| the plan and which do not violate physical boundaries such as roads or substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| changed conditions such as unanticipated new roads or utilities, obvious and significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| errors or omissions in the plan, changes in government policy or trends that warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| reconsideration of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| In addition, as noted in Chancellor Fansler's 2008 opinion, the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:16| has set forth the standard that in order for an amendment to be approved, it must be found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| quote necessary because of substantially changed or changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| We would submit to you that restriping of Governor John Severe Highway is the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| that has changed since the last two times we've been before you on this same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| TDOT doesn't consider restriping of John Severe Highway a significant change and that's evidenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| in the letter, a copy of which you received shortly, I mean just prior to me speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| In conclusion, there was no public meeting, no consideration to the scenic highway designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| and no evidence that substantial change has occurred that would support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| We believe MPC's support of the amendment was improperly considered and County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| should not approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| We urge you, all those here this evening, to vote against this item to amend the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| plan from low-density residential to medium-density residential for the Wells Creek Tract on John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6795)|

| 1:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| You have five minutes to rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:34| My name is Victor Jernigan, 108 Stequoia Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville, 37912, and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| to let Mr. Gass speak for just about a minute and a half, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:52| I'm Edward Gass, 720 West Governor John Severe Highway, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| I'm speaking in favor of the Wells Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| I have resided in South Knoxville for 44 and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| Just in the last two or three years, I've seen quality growth in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| I do feel there is a great need for quality, affordable residential development in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| Mr. Jernigan's planned condo development will certainly provide this to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| My wife and I have attended all the MPC meetings on this as well as the County Commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:35| We've listened to the proposed plans and have seen the pictures and plans that Mr. Jernigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| presented regarding this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| We've heard the people of South Doyle Homeowners Association and their reasons that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| This development had been before MPC four times and has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| However, each time it came before the Knox County Commission, it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| At the last commission meeting, South Doyle Homeowners Association stated that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| not against the condos being built, but they did not want apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| Mr. Jernigan had made it very clear that the development would be condos at 7.5 units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:25| acre, which was approved by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Mr. Jernigan has contacted the landowners that were directly affected by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| None objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| The landowners expressed their approval and agreed that it would benefit the South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| And I trust Mr. Jernigan will build quality condos as he has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| Mr. Jernigan did request the MPC to consider 90 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| However, he advised he would accept the 7.5 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| The MPC did approve the planned residential at a density up to 7.5 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:12| In closing, I would request that the commission approve this planned residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| for 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| This is a flat piece of land, which is a rare find in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:28| And it's time to put something of quality that will benefit South Knoxville because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| And it will enhance our community greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| And also for the comment that was made a moment ago about the scenic highway, in some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| MPC meetings and county commissions, if you were looking at your minutes, you will find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| out a definition of a scenic highway is no billboards and no junkyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| So we do have a scenic highway in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| Condos is not a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| Condos is not a junkyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Mr. Jernigan will, if he is given the opportunity, will build something that will be fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:14| for South Knoxville, and we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| We haven't seen anything from the beginning of this, all the episodes of the MPC and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| So therefore, this is our last shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| And we do have just, we've got a few people, we don't have the support as far as that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| because we don't have as many homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| And I do want to say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| As a property owner of South Knoxville, that if these people, South Doyle Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:52| will be in support, whoever is building on this, if they will give the support, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7072)|
| 1:58:00| if they would even contact the members that are involved in the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:07| I have never had a phone call, letter, or anything, what the South Doyle Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| Association, do you approve of this or do you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| And I really do appreciate your all's time listening to me, and I ask you in all sincerity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:25| that you will vote to approve this, and we do have a few people that is in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| Would everybody stand up that's in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Thank you, Mr. Dassey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| You have one minute, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| And I'll be able to summarize quite quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| The issue in front is a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| The issues of scenic parkway and all of the other clatter and all the emails that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| have received and the phone calls that I'm sure you have received are just to cloud a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| very basic and simple issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| The sector plan was approved at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| The density was approved for seven and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| A site plan, a use on review, must move forward on this property showing the density of seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:14| and a half units an acre and how that will be implemented on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| It must comply not only with all of the zoning and setback and landscaping restrictions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| are part of the plan that are required, but it also must comply with whatever scenic parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| restrictions would be imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| What we're doing today is a rezoning of the property to give an opportunity to move this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| The opposition has three minutes rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:51| My name is Victoria DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| I live at 2921 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| Victor Jernigan has shown pictures to you all of some wonderful, wonderful things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| he has proposed to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| I'm sure that you all are aware that just last week on a development that was started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| by him, there was levied a $50,000 fine because of the stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7211)|
| 2:00:17| I don't know how many of you saw the journal, the Knoxville Journal, a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| The Wells Creek hit the front page with stormwater concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| The plan that he started four years ago, the stormwater was set up very, very well, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| it has been neglected as he has tried to come back here again and again and again trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| to get greater density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| Which, by the way, the scenic highway, one of the things that we need to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| about to keep it scenic was not just signage, it's not just building height, it is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| to limit the density of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| They said that MDR exists across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| That was from 30 years ago before a sector plan was ever agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| So, there is a sector plan that is a document that you are supposed to guard, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| was hours and hours and hours invested into the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| MPC has not even followed their own policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| There was not a public hearing provided by MPC on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| The area owners who are here tonight in support of this, last month on MPC there was a subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:35| item on the agenda that has been pulled, so you cannot see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| But it was to add the contiguous properties into another district to create a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:48| And I don't know about the contracts, if there are any, about purchasing development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| but if there are, I can see why that they would be in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| In fact, I recall, I believe, I remember that the gas property was considered as a possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7317)|
| 2:02:03| clubhouse for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| So, I would understand why maybe Mr. and Mrs. Gatz would be in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| I am very, very concerned about this project because I know that there are other landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:18| right now, our economy the way it is, people are wanting to make a living and to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| bigger buck if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| But by allowing a sector plan without having the reasons that you need to have one, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| letter that you have from the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation before you, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| you read, it says that during the resurfacing project, okay, that is not a widening of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| In fact, down it says, due to the narrow width, that not all the locations could even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| reserve a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| They said all this work was completed within the existing typical section of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| with no additional widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| So, you cannot consider the restriping of Johnsonville Highway as a major substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| And also, Johnsonville Highway serves as a barrier, and it would cross over into an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| that's not in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| So, I would urge you today, please do not allow the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| You have three minutes, Mr. Johnigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| Once again, the Southfield homeowners are interested in confusion on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:33| We had the reason that this property is being rezoned, this 22 acres, it was previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| rezoned, and the sector plan was previously changed after numerous public meetings, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| an MPC vote to change the sector plan a previous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| And that density was approved for 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| The Southfield Homeowners Association, which did lose a county commission, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| Southfield Homeowners Association said they wouldn't oppose low-density residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| two-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| So, I went back to acquire the adjoining seven and a half acres on Tipton Station Road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| add that property into this development to have a 29-acre total site and redo the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| on the density that would be available in a typical subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| Mr. Freeze, once again, at that particular time, generated this whole cloud of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:26| on transfer of development rights, which it was never a transfer, it was a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| So, because that issue became so contentious at county commission, that plan of low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| residential was lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| A second opportunity to go back and just purchase the property added into the project as low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| residential development was also opposed by the South Doyle Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| There have been numerous public meetings on this particular project in every possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| After the last attempt to acquire additional property as low-density residential and create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| a standard subdivision by clustering the homes as the best management practices would indicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| after that met resistance from South Doyle Homeowners, I then decided to come back one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| The original 22 acres that had been rezoned and changed to medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| had passed MPC sector plan change is what is before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| It is the second time this property has been approved by completely different MPC commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:30| completely different MPC commissions, as to how the density in this area should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:37| And, again, I believe that Chancellor Fantzler's decision leaves the change of the sector plan entirely in the hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:46| in Knox County, in the hands of the MPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| And I, therefore, ask you to ratify their decision to change the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| and approve the density at seven-and-a-half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| First thing I'd like to do is read a couple of sentences here from the Knox Heritage Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| It says, Knoxville is defined by the ridges and rivers and pastoral views that surround it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| Those views are threatened by development that is not asked to address the cost imposed on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:28| Our local government should act with haste to approve ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| and plans designed to preserve the signature views that distinguish our community from most others in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7592)|
| 2:06:39| Future development should minimize the impact on view sheds and ridge stops and pastoral views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| in order to preserve the stunning scenes that attract visitors and connect people to the places where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:54| The issue, the main issue here seems to be the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| I'm very familiar with this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| I have worked on every single one of those in the South County since we started doing them back in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7622)|
| 2:07:12| And as was stated earlier, this last time when we did it five years ago or five-and-a-half years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| we had over 200 people that worked on this as a community with the staff of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| to come up with a plan that we felt is what we needed for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| Now, once a sector plan passes this body, it becomes a law and a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7650)|
| 2:07:38| You cannot break a contract by one party's actions without consent of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:47| And I submit to you that that's what has happened in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| In the staff report at the last MPC meeting where this was zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| and, by the way, it might have passed MDR at MPC before, but it did not get past this body at MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| I'll come back to that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| But in the staff report at that last meeting, it says that the staff decided in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:15| that this and other properties should be MDR and changed in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| That constitutes change by one party without knowledge of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| And I can assure you that if this goes to court, it will be tossed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| Now, about two-and-a-half, three weeks ago out at John T. O'Connor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| there was a meeting of about 75 people who had a very long list of gripes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7717)|
| 2:08:46| and complaints about the actions and inactions possibly of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7726)|
| 2:08:54| I'm not here to rail on them tonight per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| but I will say this, that the Executive Committee has been pushing for a follow-up meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7737)|
| 2:09:06| to see what we can do to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| It's been shown when we talked in the storm water problems earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| If you don't plan these things up front, problems come down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| And that's what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| Our group, our homeowners group out there, agreed, and the first time around with Mr. Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| that condos at one to five we could live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| even though it's going to destroy some of these pastoral views that I just read about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:36| But he kept coming back and coming back and coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| Part of that comeback, as far as this transfer of development rights and adding these others on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| I have on good authority came from Mr. Donaldson, the idea to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| So when the director comes in and starts telling developers how to get around the laws that are on the books that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:55| supposed to be operating by, I have a serious problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| And I think that we have some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| Mr. Gass said he has no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| Has Mr. Jernigan offered to buy your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| I have the floor, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| You'll get your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| You'll get your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| I have the floor, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| Has Mr. Jernigan offered to buy your property, Mr. Gass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7816)|
| 2:10:26| May I ask you a question also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| Answer mine first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Yes, he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| Then you have a vested interest in whether his project goes forward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Tell me when I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| If you have the opportunity to better yourself or better your community, are you not going to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:53| Well, let me answer it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| The Constitution says you can do that if you don't do it at the, and I don't know what exactly the word is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7855)|
| 2:11:02| but in other words, if you don't impose something uncomfortable on your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:09| Basically, that's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Now, you've been asked, and I'm sure some of your neighbors have been asked to sell your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| so naturally you're going to be in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| So let's take that off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| That's all we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| Also, I've been informed that since this past NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| there was a grading estimate put out that said this was going to be apartments, not condos, but apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7887)|
| 2:11:34| And everything we've heard from Mr. Jernigan has said condos, condos, condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| But the grading estimate says apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| He said this is a rare piece of land that should be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Somebody said that a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| How are you going to preserve it if you fill it up with houses where you can't even see any green space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| We talked about unlike developments facing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| Let me remind all of you that the John Sevier Highway is a dividing line between the city and no man's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7920)|
| 2:12:11| That means, as far as I'm concerned, it don't matter what's on the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| And I think that an NPC is making a big imposition when they say that because one's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| And we're talking about different boundaries here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| We're talking about urban versus rural or planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| So that dog just don't hunt in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| What's the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| MDR and arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Where is it written in blood that there has to be MDR on arterials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| An arterial road should be a traffic mover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| It should not be congested with 2,300 more vehicles a day coming out on one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:52| That's another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| Mr. Jernigan comes back and increases that 80 because he needs to get over 100 to get an extra piece of commercial property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7975)|
| 2:13:03| for a little more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| So here we are looking at solving a problem for one man who wants to make a dollar at our expense in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7984)|
| 2:13:14| that we've got to live with from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| I made the analogy at that meeting over there that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| we talked about public process and being vetted up here at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| If you were in court and on trial for murder and the judge looked down to your attorney and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:33| you've got five minutes to prove this man guilty or not, you wouldn't be happy, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| But the same thing happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| That judge is going to hand down a verdict that you've got to live with the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| The verdict that's passed down here, our community has to live with the rest of our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| So, Mr. Chairman, I vote that we deny this petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| Sir, do I have the floor now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| Go ahead and address what he's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| You mentioned a lot of this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| You called me up here for one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| I didn't ask you to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| You didn't say to sit down either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| If you could have just went ahead and just made your comments, I would have went ahead and sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| Mr. John, can he address you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| I believe on a couple of matters if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| And I want to actually thank Mr. Brown for pointing out and reading that article from Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| because if you'll refer to the color drawings you'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| you'll see the little red circle on those drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| which clearly show that in all of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| there's very little or no land left for attached medium-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| Everything is a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| It's too steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| It doesn't have a main road that connects, or it doesn't have sewer availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| This is one of the few tracks left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| because the South Doyle Homeowners Association has meticulously had an assault on every piece of medium-density residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:14| that can be built on in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| They rezoned 78 acres to a highway commercial for the Super Walmart and the Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| They rezoned 58 acres and supported the rezoning of 58 acres where the Lowe's is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| that was already developed into a subdivision with sewer and water gas already run on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:35| That subdivision was torn up so they could build the Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| The other handouts that you have, one is from the EPA talking about how density benefits society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:45| and all of the stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| The attachment to that is the 37919 zip code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| basically the two miles surrounding the intersection of North Shore Drive and Morrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| The other one is the South Knoxville area, and the whole South Knoxville sector is about five miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8157)|
| 2:16:04| and I've used a three-mile section of the South Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| And what's really important about that is that if you look at the densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| and you look at there's 21,000 people approximately in a two-mile circle around North Shore at Morrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| There's 11,000 people in a three-mile area around the South Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| There's 4,000 people, soon to be 5,000 people, working at the intersection of John Sevier and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:30| It's the largest employment, single employment node outside of the Park West area in all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| And yet there's no medium-density residential property available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| And the other point which keeps coming up, my goal is to build condos on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| and the South Doyle homeowners are absolutely adamantly afraid of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| But if you'll also refer to the West Knoxville section, the Morrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| you will see in comparison South Doyle, the South Knoxville section, three-mile radius, has 17% renters in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8214)|
| 2:17:03| with a median income of I think it's $54,000, $55,000 average income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| The West Knoxville section, the two-mile radius, I believe it's 37% of the group is renters, 37% are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:23| I'm sorry, 32%, 31.6% are renters, almost double the number that are in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| There's no logical correlation between the positions supported all over Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| that South Doyle has meticulously assaulted and taken on and destroyed every medium-density residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8255)|
| 2:17:42| that's buildable in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| Mr. Brown's assertions, again, are typical of what I've encountered in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part2?start=8265)|
