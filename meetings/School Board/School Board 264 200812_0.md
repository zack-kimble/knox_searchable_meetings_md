| 0:01:56| but I wanted to review the additions to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| and as always, we can have discussion on these items as they are read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=119)|

| 0:02:28| The TDOE requested the grant assurances be returned by August 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=148)|

| 0:03:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Okay, and also just if you're, I always forget to say this at regular sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| but if you are watching, please know that we also discussed this agenda last week at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| Now I would like to ask Ms. Renee Kelly, who is our Chief of Staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| to come forward for the introduction of our Minority Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=214)|
| 0:03:49| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| I didn't want to, Scott, I hated to take away your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| In an effort to honor social distancing, I'll introduce the MAC members that are present this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| but they will come in in increments of five and then will excuse themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| Many of you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| but the purpose of the MAC is to provide an important voice for certified minority educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| in the district's decision-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| and to provide the superintendent with minority teachers' insights, suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| and perspectives on critical educational issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| The MAC, the Minority Advisory Council, will enable better educational and administrative decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| and ultimately, that's why we're all here, will lead to greater student learning outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=273)|

| 0:17:48| Ms. Catterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Just, I would like to just give my line of thinking behind presenting face covering policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| and then we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| So the district is opting to reopen schools, and I think it's our, in making that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| level decision to reopen schools, and if that's the course that we're taking, I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| we need to make a district level decision with enforcing as much as possible to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| people safe within our schools, and so that is the, that's the reason why, also I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| that we have some schools that are 100% mask only, like if you're coming into the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| you must have a mask on, and then we have other schools that are abiding by what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| in the reopening plan that is when social distancing is feasible or available, or can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| I don't have the language pulled up, but you know what I'm talking about, and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| that that's a recipe for disaster, because you're going to have different schools doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| different things, and different communities doing different things, and then we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| open, and then we have an uptick in one community to where the other community could possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| So that's another reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| And then third, when I asked about a month ago at our last board meeting about how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| handling the mask situation, there was a lot of, like people were just unsure of what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1146)|
| 0:19:16| looks like, and if we're unsure at the leadership level and at the board level, then I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| with what the unsureness looks like in the classroom level, and so I think that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| then when I also was asked what happens if a child completely refuses, it was suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| that they use a dress code policy, and the dress code policy leads to suspension, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| so that is also where I think we need clear guidelines that aren't punitive to what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| if masks are not enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| In the policy itself, if we do take the approach to do the policy, I'm completely open to amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| and changing and what direction it needs to go into, because this is one person's concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| that I worked with also with Gary, but I think everyone's input needs to be shared with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| but the biggest thing that I recommend is that we do have a policy in place that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| leave room for people to just do what they decide that they want to do in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| So that's my line of thinking, and that's where I stand, and I'm not going to be as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| yeah, that's just where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Okay, thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Personally, I think this policy is too restrictive, but as I read through my emails today, I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| to share the thought of one of the emails, but there were many that were similar, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| said, this new mask mandate that is happening on first reading tonight is not fair or well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1241)|
| 0:20:49| thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| This is not what you and we explained to parents when they made their decision of online versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| It is not what teachers knew when they made their decision of returning to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| It is not what went out to parents in our back-to-school reopening plans, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| it is extremely unfair to do this kind of adjustment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| So I won't be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Okay, thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| I think the real issue that we have with different interpretations is one of communication, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| when we really semantically break this down, this policy says the exact same thing as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| opening plan for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It says it differently, but it says the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| All of the same things are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| They are just worded slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| The issue comes from some individual schools that sent out opening plans that did not match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| our district plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| And when we have individual schools interpreting things because we have been unclear at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| district level, that leads to problems and that leads to misunderstandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| So looking at this policy, I can't find anything in here that isn't in our opening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1325)|
| 0:22:14| I've talked to principals throughout my district and some others, and they are also supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| They did ask – let me pull it up here – they did ask that there be language that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| students to remove masks when outdoor at recess if social distancing guidelines are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| And I think that language is here in line 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| It says, determined by the principal in consultation with the teacher, and that permission would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| not be unreasonably held – unreasonably withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And that's for specific instructional needs and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| I think that's perfectly reasonable, and that is also clear in our opening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| So all of the things that I've seen in emails from parents and from principals is supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1376)|
| 0:23:06| of a policy that clearly matches our opening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| And this does match our district-level opening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| The problem is with some individual school plans, and I think we need to take a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So when we say for students who refuse to wear a mask and the consequences to that – verbal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1409)|
| 0:23:39| warning, second offense verbal warning, quarantine from general population and parent pickup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| – how is that going to be documented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Is that a disciplinary action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I mean, if the parent has to pick them up, is that going to be considered a suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| It would be documented like a regular disciplinary – offenses are documented, so that way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| keep up with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| So if we had an elementary student that repeatedly took their mask off and was sent home multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| times, I mean, what would happen with that student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Oh, to follow the consequences within the discipline policy that – currently that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| the board has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| So, again, that would vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| I think it would depend on the offenses and warnings and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| So a progressive disciplinary action would be taken by the assistant principal principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| Are you asking me what specifically will be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Well, I'm just wondering if we're going to be expelling students for not wearing – or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| for taking masks off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| You know, I'm thinking younger students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| I'm thinking kindergarten, first, second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| And what the consequences if, you know, we have to send them home multiple times, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| Well, again, I think using good judgment on something like that, you know, I would – our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| principals are very adept at using good judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| So I think in terms of the offense, the warning and looking at the situation and taking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So, you know, again, we've not done this before, so it'll be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| But we just know from the standpoint of the data, the scientific data, that if we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| to try to prevent and stop the spread, then, you know, the importance is wearing the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| And, you know, I think we have to have a way to enforce that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| So I think until we get into it and actually get some experience with it behind us, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| know, we'll know more maybe after the first week or two of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| But I think our folks will use good judgment in terms of enforcing the policy and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| the discipline that goes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| So it's going to take some getting used to, obviously, since it's brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| And I've been trying to say, too, along the way, you know, if you've got a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| that's going to be in person in school, get a mask and have them get used to wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| that, because that's what we're going to do to try to protect each other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| our teachers, our staff, and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| So another question is about the, I guess, the last paragraph, where principals shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| address visitors who refuse to wear masks or face coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| You know, I did have an administrator reach out to me saying, you know, they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| want that to be at their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| It should just be you have to wear a mask if you're coming in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| You know, to the other end of that, they don't want to be policing adults coming into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| the building, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| So I don't know if that would be necessary to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| And then the third question was from a parent who is asking, if there's room in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| classroom, does it still apply, like, if you might have 10 kids in a classroom that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| are socially distanced, can they take that mask off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Would that fall under the principal and teacher's discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| That would be the principal's decision, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Mr. Thomas, is it your opinion as our superintendent that a policy is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| I do support the policy, just because, again, without it, there may be challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| I know Mr. Dupler has worked with Ms. Satterfield on this, and I think it's good to have a policy in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| I do, as Ms. Owen stated, see that so much of this is things that are already in the opening plan that the schools put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1680)|
| 0:28:13| and it is a shame that schools that are not following this, which I do think are the exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| can't be dealt with individually instead of having to do something on a blanket level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| That said, though, I do appreciate the fact that sometimes policy is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| because it strengthens the position of an administrator when they make these kind of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| So I do, as much as I hate to add restrictions, I do see where there could be some merit to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1718)|
| 0:28:50| I do like Ms. Christie's suggestion about the stating that masks are required of visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1730)|
| 0:29:01| and then if the principal has reason to say they don't need one, they certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| But initially, I would support that change being put in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1749)|
| 0:29:18| And also dealing with the discipline issues of students that may refuse to wear masks and continually refuse to wear masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1758)|
| 0:29:33| Mr. Thomas, is it possible that if this is in fact the attitude that a child or perhaps a child parent may take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1773)|
| 0:29:47| and we probably will run into this, that we could require that student, in lieu of suspending, to enroll in virtual school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1787)|
| 0:29:57| I mean, can that not just be what the action will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| I think we'd have to look at that on an individual basis and see what the circumstances around it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| I think first preference would be, if you're not wearing a mask, you're going to have to be physically distanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| provided that the classroom would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| And just have conversations with the parent, child, and look at each individual situation, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| So it could be a situation where virtual learning might be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| I'd rather look at that on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| All right. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Yes, when I looked at this policy, I mean, the people that to me are the most involved in what's going on at the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| and trying to come up with their plans are the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| So I really wanted their opinion, and so I sent this to all of the principals in my district and their eight schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| And four, I did not hear back from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Three, I immediately heard back from that they appreciated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| There were some minor tweakings and some things, like the thing about the recess was brought up by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| but I think that that's covered in the policy and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So three definitely did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| One responded that they didn't think it was necessary, and then I didn't hear back from four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| So I did feel like at least three of my principals were very strongly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| And then I did hear from a few people that were against this face-covering policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| but one thing I would have to note is I look at the controversy over July 1st when our county decided to do a mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| and, oh, my gosh, it was all over the place what people thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| But it was amazing once it was put down there and once the signs went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Most of our community has been very compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| and sometimes you just actually have to put the rules out there to get people to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| And, you know, I know this is one of those things that we have a lot of disagreement in our community on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| and I get that and I respect that people feel differently about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| But to try to get schools back safely, you know, I do respect this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| and I respected the opinions that I got from my principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Yeah, I would just like to, I guess, piggyback off what Jerry said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| I do like the idea of if you have a repeat offender, at least giving them the option to do virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| And my concern is it's not that I'm against the masks in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| It's when we rolled out the reopening plan and we asked the question, what if a student won't wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| it was, well, it's going to be positive reinforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| It won't be punitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| And that's what parents heard when they signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| So, you know, they might have realized that their students might struggle with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| but because they heard us say that it wouldn't be punitive, they went ahead and chose to do in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| So I do feel like, you know, because obviously we're changing that a little bit now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| so I do think that we need to give parents some options rather than just multiple suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| Okay. Ms. Edelman, I don't know who had their mic down first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| I wanted to directly speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| This is the reason why I want something in place for guidance on what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| because I don't want high suspension rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| So as a team, as a collective, we can come up with that incentive to put in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| But when I was told that it would go to the Dress Code policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| and the Dress Code policy itself leads to in-school suspension and multiple days at home suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| You have the opportunity to correct the behavior or someone brings you clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| If you don't do that or they don't do that, then you're in ISS, in school suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| So I support that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| No one has been able to give me an answer of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Ms. Edelman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I just wanted to offer a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And before I do that, I would also quote a principle as saying that consistency or lack of is why we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| And so the amendment speaks to Ms. Kresge's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| And if we can change the last paragraph on the second page to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| visitors shall wear face coverings at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Those who refuse may be removed from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| And I think shall wear covers requirement and may be removed can also cover those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2072)|
| 0:34:40| who may have some reason that they can't wear a face covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| And then the principle can determine that or whomever their designee may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| Can you read that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Visitors shall wear face coverings at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Those who refuse may be removed from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I don't see a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I'm just offering a friendly amendment if it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| So, Ms. Butterfield, would you, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you, Ms. Edelman, for the reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| And do we have discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| I have no problem with your amendment, Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| But it seems to me that maybe we might be making too much out of this, out of this particular aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2133)|
| 0:35:45| We have security there on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| And the principle could call security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| You know, we don't have to put that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Or if they still refuse, then he or she or somebody, either security or the administrator, could call law enforcement at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2157)|
| 0:36:13| But I don't think that needs to be in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I think that, you know, surely we've got enough faith in our administrators to follow through with something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2177)|
| 0:36:27| Now, I do have a little, and I support masks, wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| If they have room, once they get in the classroom, and a principal approves it, that they can social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| That's a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| But while they're in the hallway, on the bus, at lunch, you know, other than just eating, I think they should wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2204)|
| 0:36:56| And I also, having spent 30-something years in the classroom, I think that you're going to have some kids, for whatever reason, that just will test you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2216)|
| 0:37:12| You know, they can't make me do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| What are they going to do, call my mama and send me home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| I'll be back in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| That seems, you know, I don't want to get into positive and negative reinforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| But I do think that there has to be some consequences that the students are aware of and that they have a little bit of fear of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2248)|
| 0:37:43| Well, maybe fear is too strong a word, but they don't want to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2263)|
| 0:37:51| Now, you know, I'm not recommending this, but this quarantine deal, who decides on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2271)|
| 0:38:03| The principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Well, that suggestion came from, I know that some of our schools are, if a child is struggling with the mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2286)|
| 0:38:16| they're creating these spaces for students to take a moment to get in, like a space room, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| But I guess, again, asking for support on how to develop the policy that's going to work best for Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| if we need to put in there at the discretion of the principal or the discretion of the teacher to determine that from the general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| I know it's going to, what we have now, what I've heard from principals is that masks are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| If the child refuses, the teacher calls the principal, the principal then takes it under their control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| and either call home or they sit in the principal's office X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| So that's what some schools are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| I think, and I'm okay with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| The biggest thing is that schools are doing individual things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| And if we're opening schools at a district level, then we need to have a district-level policy regarding the safety of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| So I support whatever direction we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| I don't disagree, except I think it should be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| And maybe it, did you say a half hour or did I misunderstand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| Well, maybe that might be a little light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2364)|
| 0:39:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I don't have an exact thing that I want to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| And I know this wouldn't work in every situation, but this has been probably, oh, 30 years ago, 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2380)|
| 0:39:53| probably nobody in this room except for Bob and myself know this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| But Billy K. Knisely was principal at Doyle and it was called Doyle in those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| And he had two boys that had been sent into the office freshman for scuffling in the hallway or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| And these were good kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| They had never been in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And he walked back to his office, he said, trying to figure out something that would punish them and they'd get the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2419)|
| 0:40:29| And at the same time, he didn't want to be too hard on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| So he put them in conference room and made them stay in there for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| Brought their lunch to them and he played music for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| Played jingle bells for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| And he said he never saw those kids back in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Now, I mean, no, no, I'm not suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| But, you know, it could be something without being extremely harmful as long as they're aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2461)|
| 0:41:11| I guess the biggest thing is that they wouldn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Now, you know, you could do something like after the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2475)|
| 0:41:25| have the parent come and pick them up as long as it was before 1 o'clock or before 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| If it was after, have them have to get off from work, come pick them up the next day at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| I'd say, I'm just guessing, of course, but I would say that if a parent had to split their work shift and go get that kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2500)|
| 0:41:54| I doubt seriously that they would repeat it too many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Now, you might have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| You might have some that don't work, so it wouldn't matter, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| But that's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| I'm for masks, but I do think you have to have some reasonable consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2530)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| And I'll just make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| The, I think the, I heard from, I've heard from parents, I've heard from teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| and I've heard from principals that I reached out to specifically, the principals, to get their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| And they were positive about, they had positive comments about having a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| and having some direction on consequences and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| I think that the, I heard, the thing that I heard from parents and teachers was what Ms. Christie had said already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| that this is not what we signed up for, that this was not what they, you know, thought they were signing on to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| and that it's another change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| And I really think that it's more probably the way it's phrased, more so than a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| I don't think that it's as much a change as it is the way it's phrased, if I'm understanding it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| which I would like to see it spelled out a little more clearly so that it's more congruent with what the reopening plan says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2602)|
| 0:43:33| And I also heard from principals, like Ms. Owen said, that they would like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| I think it needs to say specifically, if kids are outside with distance, that they don't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| So we probably need to add that, because I heard specifically about recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| And then the other, and I'm looking at an old version of the policy, but in number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| it basically says that that gives latitude to the schools to allow kids to remove their masks when distancing occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2640)|
| 0:44:12| if I'm reading it correctly, if that is appropriate for the, you know, whatever they're being directed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| I think that's what it says, but I don't think it's clear enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| I don't think it's, if that's what it says, I think it should more closely match what our reopening plan said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| if that's the intention of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| So do you want to speak to that, Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| And I guess that leads for interpretation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| But I know that in some schools that they're offering mask breaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| and so the autonomy for a teacher by case-by-case is the opportunity for them to provide mask breaks, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| That was the line of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| One of the issues, you know, that I heard, and I'm sure that it's shared by many, is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| a lot of the elementary teachers and a lot of the teachers in general have been tasked with going into their room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| and creating space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| So they've taken out furniture, and they've done all that they can to try to, you know, get as much space between students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| So if we have teachers who have done that successfully because that's what the reopening plan called for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2716)|
| 0:45:25| then if that's not what we're saying, that is certainly a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| And I think that we need to, you know, that it needs to be recognized as a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| So I guess that would be my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| And here's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| For a school that has thought through their theater class, their chorus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and they've decided to use the auditorium where they can literally have 15 feet between kids who are singing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| And so they've addressed it with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| So this number three would accommodate that particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Mr. Dupler, do you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| I'll be happy to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| So let me talk about first the purpose of a board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| The purpose of a board policy has always been to give direction across the district, but also to be somewhat general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2781)|
| 0:46:30| Historically, board policies have not been so specific that they break down each and every rule and regulation for a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2790)|
| 0:46:40| A school would then look to administrative procedures for that, would look to their handbooks for that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2800)|
| 0:46:49| would look to, in this case, the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| In talking with Ms. Satterfield, the purpose of this particular policy was to be read in conjunction with the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| And there are certain areas in here which are intentionally general to give principals the latitude they need at their schools to do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2821)|
| 0:47:13| So, for instance, what's been discussed, indoor versus outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| This policy specifically covers indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| It doesn't cover outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| So if you're outdoors and you're socially distanced, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| This policy doesn't apply at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| That takes care of your recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| And, again, this needs to match the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| It's number three now, but you were correct, Ms. Warren, that the previous version had a little bit different language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2858)|
| 0:47:50| But that was in there just for the purpose of classes that would need to have masks removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2870)|
| 0:48:00| For instance, band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| I mean, that's a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Chorus would be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Probably a PE class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| And there could be many different classes, frankly, if you're spaced out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| And the principal and the teachers can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| The policing the adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| I mean, that amendment's been read into the record, and that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| Again, the purpose there was to have the principal have his or her control of her building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| and wouldn't have to automatically throw somebody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| But I think with the language that's been suggested, that would work fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| So that's the purpose of the plan, and I was thinking there might have been something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| That word was used intentionally because, again, that could look different from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| A school could have a particular place for quarantining children, could be a particular part of a classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| could be a partition, could be all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| Again, this is an attempt to make something district-wide that will still look a little different from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| And I guess part of my, you know, and I had, you know, underlined the word inside, that this is inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| but we all know that when things aren't stated, then they, you know, people assume that this goes for the whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| you know, outside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| So I guess that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| I just want to know, Mr. Thomas, you said you supported this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| So the intention behind number three, which let me just read it for people who are not looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| employees and visitors may remove masks or face coverings on a case-by-case basis for specific instructional needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| or other activities as determined by the principal in consultation with the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| and permission will not be unreasonably withheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| in which case the teacher will utilize appropriate social distancing measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| So is the intent of that, would your understanding be that it does line up with what we've stated in the reopening plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| which says that you need a mask unless there is social, if you cannot maintain social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| This is just a more pointed way to say it so that it's, so that the teacher's working with principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| And I guess there's a lot more specificity here than the plan was a little bit more general in terms of saying physical distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| But this is a little more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| But that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| So you don't see it as being different than the reopening plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| I know Ms. Satterfield had a comment, and I see Mr. McMillan and Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| So, Ms. Satterfield, do you want to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I don't think I, I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Ms. Owen next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I was just going to offer a possible amendment that might allay the difficulty in number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| Looking after the line of instructional needs and other activities, Mr. Dugler, would it work to insert a parenthetical that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| such as when six-foot distance can be maintained, outdoor recess, and other appropriately distanced activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3090)|
| 0:51:40| I think that would be more, I think that would give the schools more clarity and provide for less questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| Does that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| I was also, one person reached, this is one person, so we can, it's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| But they also mentioned that how they read it and interpreted it was also for teachers who are doing virtual training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| I mean virtual teaching in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| So, do we need to put for in-person learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Like, I don't, I don't know if that even brings confusion or if I just brought confusion to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| To your point, I had a question from someone, and I forgot it until you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| So, if we have a virtual teacher in the building and the teacher's alone in her room, obviously there's social distancing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| So, what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| But can we, do we need to add, would it be clearer if we add if you are alone in your room or something to that effect that, it should be, it should be apparent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3149)|
| 0:52:43| Yeah, it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Yeah, it should be apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Your social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| As long as we understand that if there's, if you cannot maintain, basically if you can't maintain social distancing, you need a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| If you don't have a medical reason and blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Mr. McMillan, did you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Maybe we should put, we just, if you're alone in your room, just use common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| That would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| We could use that for some other places too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| I don't think we can mandate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Mr. Law Director, I understand what you're saying about the keeping things general, but I guess what concerns me is that we need a degree of consistency, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3197)|
| 0:53:41| And if, you know, if one school does this and a school 10, 15 miles down the road does something that's totally different, it's not even in the ballpark in comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3221)|
| 0:53:59| I don't have a problem with them doing the same type of activities, whatever they may be, for the same amount of time or approximately the same amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3239)|
| 0:54:12| But how do we just, are we just at the mercy of our administrators, just have to ask the superintendent to put out an edict to make sure that they do stress this to them, the consistency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3252)|
| 0:54:32| Because this, folks, you're not going to satisfy everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| You just aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| So you might as well, if you're trying to satisfy everybody, and you alluded to it, Ms. Satterfield there, with one person, you just can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3279)|
| 0:54:51| So what we, as I see it, what we need to do is do whatever benefits is consistent and benefits the vast majority of the kids that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3291)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Mr. McMillan, I mean, I think this policy, and I think Ms. Satterfield's intent in this policy was to bring some more uniform measures to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3315)|
| 0:55:28| Now, to your point, Mr. McMillan, is it going to look exactly the same at every school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| But if you have one school that is allowing, you know, no masks, without social distancing, then this policy will enable Mr. Thomas, the director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3334)|
| 0:55:51| to step in and say, hey, school, you know, you need to follow this policy and look similar to all of our other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3351)|
| 0:56:00| So I think this policy will give you that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| Another thing, let me say this as well, and Ms. Satterfield and I talked about this, so as another amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| you'll want to add that you're asking that this policy be waived for second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| because I believe you'd like this to go into effect before the school year starts, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Yes, the next second reading will be on the second, September, or even after that, because that's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| I don't know. I don't know. It's on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| But school starts August 24th, and so to even give us a shot of even staying in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| I would like to make the motion to, whenever the time comes, because I think we still have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| Yeah, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Okay, to pass it and enforce it before school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| Okay, that's helpful to bring out while we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I have another question regarding the students who would have the exemption for their medical condition with their IEP or their 504 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3409)|
| 0:57:00| We're not saying, I mean, the way this reads, it makes me concerned that they have to have that written into their IEP before it can be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3420)|
| 0:57:10| But I don't think that every, I mean, it could be that some students come back to school before they have an IEP for this year, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3430)|
| 0:57:18| or before it's added. Can you address that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| I can. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Obviously, if it is in a 504 or an IEP, it needs to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| But, and that's just what that's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| I mean, you know, but obviously if a student has any type of medical reason, you know, asthma, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| or some condition that makes it difficult for them to breathe, then, you know, those accommodations can be made with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| Okay, so they would not have to have a 504 or an IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| No, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Okay, all right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Along the lines of what you were saying, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think we'd have any administrators that would be so brazen that they wouldn't tell students to wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3480)|
| 0:58:18| or insist that they wear them at least at the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| But if that should occur, then, in my opinion, that's a matter for the superintendent to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3503)|
| 0:58:33| And he needs to, because of the severity of this situation, it's not just like, oh, I forgot something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3513)|
| 0:58:44| There needs to be serious consequences with the individual that was charged with enforcing it and failed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3524)|
| 0:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you. Ms. Cobb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Do we need a second on Ms. Satterfield's amendment to vote on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Ms. Owen had a friendly amendment, and Ms. Satterfield was agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Can we have that read back? Does Ms. Coatney have it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| So the motion, the amended motion would be to approve new Board of Education Policy C-240 with added on page one in parenthetical after and other activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3551)|
| 0:59:25| such as when six-foot distancing can be maintained, outdoor recess, and or other appropriately distanced activities, close parentheses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3565)|
| 0:59:35| And on page two, in lines nine through 11, the language would be replaced with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| visitors shall wear face coverings at all times, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Those who refuse may be removed from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| And then the amendment would also waive second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3588)|
| 0:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Are there any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3599)|

| 1:00:01| We have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| So we're voting on the friendly...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| No, we don't need to vote on that because she's agreeable to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| So we're good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| So we're just voting on the policy to approve or not to approve the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| So all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3615)|

| 1:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Ms. Downs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| So we have eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=3625)|

| 1:08:31| the work that they've done and also with our HR folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4111)|

| 1:08:39| And these numbers right now are still not exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| I think they're a little bit lower based on what's happened today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| So, we've really made great progress in terms of narrowing down vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| So, if you look at the total number of teachers, last week we were in traditional program or in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| We were 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4136)|

| 1:09:10| So, again, just tremendous progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4150)|

| 1:09:20| And our teachers have really responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| You know, we talked about paying a little bit extra for giving up your plan period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| and teaching during the plan period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| And folks have really stepped up to the plate there and helped us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| And so, Dr. Ryser helped me with this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| What I was looking at a minute ago was the text, just trying to give you updated numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4177)|

| 1:09:49| And now we're down to 311?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4193)|

| 1:09:56| So, it's a huge improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| So, we had 5,597 high school students request virtual total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| And if you figure they each have four classes, that is, to Mr. Thomas' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| 22,388 classes we have to cover, if you think of each student taking four classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| And at this point, to Mr. Thomas' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| we only have 311 of those classes that will be going to Florida Virtual School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| And the cost, around $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| Correct, over $300,000 as opposed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| To 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Right, that we thought we might be at last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| So, again, just to compliment the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| and the hard work that they've done over a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| And that's what we said, you know, preferably we want to use our own folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| So, you know, I just think the whole point of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Florida Virtual would be using a lot less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| maybe even less than what we're talking about right now by the time school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| That's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Great progress, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Okay, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| I would just like to point out something with these numbers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| This is right in line with where we've been in the past on the first day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| I was looking at something a couple of days ago where the first day of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| we still had 50 certified vacancies in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| So this is, we have 49 right now, and it's definitely not the first day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| So those are the in-person classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| And to have 43 1⁄2 in a program that is completely brand new, that's fairly remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| I would like to make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Some of the, I know that we were very concerned about requiring our teachers to not be teaching both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4299)|
| 1:11:48| and we use the word simultaneous, but I want to be very clear that I mean all at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| in person and virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| However, we have some teachers who are very willing and feel that they are capable of doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| and I would hope that we could look at offering a stipend to those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| just like we would if they were giving up a plan time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| What I'm seeing from a lot of teachers is they are saying, well, I have four classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| and I have 30 and 30 in my in-person classes, and I have 18 and 18 in my online classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| If that were spread out into something that was happening simultaneously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| they could have four, still four classes, but divide those students out throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| That would allow for distancing in their in-person classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| and it would spread out those numbers so that their classes were more even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| So if there was a way to look at teachers who are willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| I know we have some who are already doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| but if we could look at offering a stipend to those who would be capable and want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| I think that would be terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Yes, I'd be glad to get with our team and see if we can make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| I think that would help a lot. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| And I know just the other day, I know a teacher asked to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| The concern initially was, you know, it's hard enough teaching in-person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| and then to ask you to do virtual while you're doing in-person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| we just didn't want to put that kind of demand on our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| But you're right, we've had some teachers who have said, hey, I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| So I think we can certainly look at that and hopefully make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you. I know specifically our ELL teachers are very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| They know these students, they've been in class with their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| and they want to continue that relationship, and they feel very comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| I have some questions about the contract, Mr. Dupler, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| First, on the first page, it says that the contract is for global school licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| and that there will be full credit courses or half credit courses with certified teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| Do we know where those certifications come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Will they have certifications that are comparable to Tennessee certifications and licensure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| I'm going to defer to Mr. Reiswick if he doesn't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| because, I mean, he and I and Shannon Jackson worked together on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| and I was doing mostly, you know, just putting what they wanted into this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| So it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| We have had, Ms. Jackson and I have had conversations with both the State Board this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| as well as Lisa Kuntz at the State Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| And so they will be required to have Tennessee certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| So we have two possibilities for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| One is Florida Virtual School has agreed to try to hire Tennessee teachers to be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| who already have Tennessee certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| And then for those who can't, they'll be able to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| We've already talked again to both the State Board and the State Department to get those licensures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| So say they are certified in Georgia or Florida or somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| there's some reciprocity for some of that licensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| but we would get them certified or the State Department would then have them certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| to teach those courses for us in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Do we have any concerns that we could lose teachers that we have who are currently on leave to this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| I probably couldn't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| There may be a better one for HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| I don't know for sure on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Mr. Dupler, looking at the second page, and I don't have one on every page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| but looking at the second page, I'm concerned about the timelines that are listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| I do understand that it says that it will be a million and a half per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4555)|
| 1:16:03| but then it could also be three million per year depending on additional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| and those services seem to be provided and then approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| which is concerning to me that we could have some additional services occurring throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| I would like to see something that says all services should have prior approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| or they would not be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| This looks like an opportunity to nickel and dime some revenue from us, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4589)|
| 1:16:36| Then we also, in number six, have a piggyback clause, which allows other agencies to also use this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| and if we are not already piggybacking on something else in the state, where's the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| When did this go out for proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| How did we come to this contract if it's not already a piggyback contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4615)|
| 1:17:03| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| So, Ms. Owen, you're right about the amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| I mean, the amounts are not set at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| The intention with this particular form was to provide some example amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| and I think the $1.5 million came from discussion last week as opposed to this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| so I think that that portion could possibly change in negotiations with Florida Virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| and then the $3 million was just there as a worst-case scenario type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4662)|
| 1:17:50| So this contract really is meant to be what I would say more of a term contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4670)|
| 1:17:57| which would mean that you can enter into business with this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| but you don't know the exact amount until the administration and the company work out what that amount is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| and that's all going to be based upon how many students are using the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| So based upon what we've heard tonight, it's going to be significantly less even than that $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| So this contract will allow whatever amount needs to be spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| but we can certainly tweak it a little bit to even show a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| As far as the piggyback clause goes, where this originated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| this is actually a form that was used by Metro Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| and we looked at using Metro Nashville's contract because it had this piggyback clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| and the problem was Metro Nashville was using a slightly different version of the Florida Virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| They are using Florida Virtual, but using it in a different manner because I believe they are completely virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| So we could not piggyback off of Metro for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4738)|
| 1:19:09| So what we did was we contacted Knox County Procurement to make sure that this was okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| and instituted more of an emergency procedure so that this could be in place if needed for this particular semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4754)|
| 1:19:24| So that was the thought behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| And then we continued to use the same type of form that Metro used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| with the intent that we could provide Florida Virtual with something that they were familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| and something that they might approve as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Okay. I have one other concern there, but based on what you have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| it also concerns me that if Knox County Procurement has agreed that this is an emergency situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| when we get down to the signature line, Knox County Procurement is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| So I think it is important if Knox County Procurement agrees that this is an emergency situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| that we have that signature that they fully understand what we are agreeing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| The reason the money concerns me so much is that when we get down to number 12 on page 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| and the termination of funding, actually that may not be exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| Wherever the severability is. Oh, there it is. The next one, number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| The termination for convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| It very clearly says we can terminate the contract at any time with 30 days' notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| but the termination date will be at the conclusion of a semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| So even if we got into this contract, let's say we had our students in the class for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| and we determined that this is not in their best interest, we can terminate that contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| but we still get to pay it until the end of the semester, if I am reading that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| Is that correct, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| Well, so I don't believe it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| I mean, I will ask John Ryswick's help on this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| but it's my understanding that the way it works is that the program has to be ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| for at least two weeks before they start charging for a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| But with that caveat, I mean, I would say yes, that once a student has been committed, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4892)|
| 1:21:41| to this program, I think in part, like it says, for the best interest of the student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| I mean, if you've gone two weeks down into the material, then continue with that for that semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4907)|
| 1:21:55| So yes, I mean, that's how it reads. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| The next place I have a concern, of course, the maintenance of records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4925)|
| 1:22:13| but the hold harmless indemnification on page six says that we agree to hold each other harmless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4933)|
| 1:22:22| including for negligent or intentional acts or omissions of either party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| And it concerns me that we would have a hold harmless clause that includes negligent or intentional acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4947)|
| 1:22:42| Number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| That also says to the extent permitted by law, Tennessee law doesn't allow us to hold them harmless for those acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| OK. Are they fully aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| I don't know if they are or not, but I mean, that's where we are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Then if we can move way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| Somewhere here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| In the second part, in Exhibit A, it's the student data use and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| We are agreeing to provide student data, student personal information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| and of course we do that often with many, many contracts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| But the list of data that can be obtained by them or that could be provided by us is fairly vast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5015)|
| 1:23:46| much more than I have seen in other contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| It includes food purchases, political affiliations, religious information, email, text messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| network, Internet or cellular communications, documents, drawings, artworks, biometric records, voice recordings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| handwriting, computer device identifiers, and geolocation data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| That's quite a lot to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| Also something that we are to include is social security number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| something that we don't even have at our schools, and disciplinary records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| Then when we get down to the next paragraph, the de-identified data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| it's talking about data that when it is used or when it's returned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| here are the things that will be redacted basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| All of those things are not listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| And I realize it's not meant to be an inclusive list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| but if we are going to have a contract that so very clearly lists the kinds of things they can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5085)|
| 1:24:53| but so lightly touches on the kinds of things that they would redact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| I would consider that very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| I can respond to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| So, Ms. Owen, you're correct that that's quite an exhaustive list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| and not every contract has that exhaustive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| I think that this form took the time to list out a lot of things that people might not otherwise think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5117)|
| 1:25:28| But FERPA, that particular federal law and other laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| there's also a companion law in Tennessee that further extends the federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| But all that would be considered personally identifiable information, or PI as they abbreviate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| So, you know, it's just listing out examples of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| And if any of that data, all that data is PI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| and all that, according to the law, would have to be redacted before anything could be produced as far as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5156)|
| 1:26:06| But it could be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| It's not saying that it will be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| It's just giving examples of the type of data that may be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| I think some of this, particularly with regard to things like computer slash device identifiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| is going to come up in that virtual setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| and I think that's why they took the time to list some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| But it doesn't mean that it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| The biometric records especially concern me because biometric records can be something like keystrokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| It could be camera photos when you knew or didn't know that the camera was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5200)|
| 1:26:48| Biometric data is used to determine how a person is interacting with the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| And so that may open our students to a level of intrusion that we should very much be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5215)|
| 1:27:05| Biometric data can track everything you are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| everything from how long it takes you to type a sentence to whether you are blinking regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| So those are things I have great concerns with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| when we are looking at someone using those for any kind of tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| whether it's just for their own data or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| We're talking about our students being put in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| And that greatly concerns me about this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| One thing I wanted to say too when I talk about the vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| just a reminder that school begins on August 24th in person and virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| It will be half a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| And the plan is to open, looking at our reopening plan, is to open in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| And that is still the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| So it seems like there's maybe some word going around there otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| But just please be reminded we're in yellow and we'll be in school on August 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| Thank you for clearing that up for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Any other questions on this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you for that, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| There has been a lot of speculation, so I appreciate you clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| And also just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| because I know we received a lot of concerns that we were not reaching out to our own people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5310)|
| 1:28:38| And clearly your numbers indicate that that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| So is it a fair statement to say that, and maybe this is for Mr. Bolden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| that's certainly your decision, that our teachers that went on administrative leave without pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| and our teachers that may have resigned or retired early because of all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| that the majority of them have been contacted if there was a vacancy that was needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5340)|
| 1:29:11| I see Scott jumped on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| So let me let Mr. Bolden respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Hello, can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| So a little bit of a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| First, Madam Chair, I'd like to use that in order to receive you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| So the problem with the – can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| Yes, thank you, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| The problem with opening that up when you're talking about people that are on leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| and giving them the option to apply for Quest is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| I think it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| The problem with that are Quest positions are not permanent positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| Quest positions are temporary due to funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| We have 18,000 students that have elected for online instruction this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| So we don't have any – it could drop to 2,000 next semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| And so part of that, those are temporary positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| So a person that's currently on leave is in a permanent position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| And so in order to transition from leave to that Quest position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| it would require them to forfeit their permanent position as a resignation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| No, I wouldn't encourage people to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| but that's what it would take in order to transition to a Quest position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| I will say this, though, a number of our teachers that have medical concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| that have reached out to us by way of our reasonable accommodation procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| we have been able to work with those folks in scheduling when best possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| to try to accommodate their needs as suggested by their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Ms. Browns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| I was just going to say given the large volume of emails that we all received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| urging a vote against this contract and outsourcing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| I commend our staff for all of their hard work in trying to fill these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| And I think it's obvious from the numbers that you all worked very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| in the last four days to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| And so I would just encourage some of the same people that urged us to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| against this outsourcing contract to email the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| and his staff and tell them the job's all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| It's always easier to complain than to compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5518)|

| 1:34:16| Tonya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| President of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Madam Chair and Board and all who are listening, I cannot say thank you enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| Okay, it's going to fall, and I didn't break it because I can't afford to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5665)|
| 1:34:34| Our salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Okay, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| I just want to say thank you in regards to, first, about the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| and supporting teachers and students across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| You all know too well that these unprecedented times has caused us many challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| and just having this added burden of getting ready for a one-day test a moment in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| it takes a lot of time and energy to make sure our students are prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| So the educators had a roaring sound that this resolution is going to go to the state board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| and hopefully they will pass a policy to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| I know this will not be the only resolution across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| As Knox County, we like to be the first and the fastest to make sure that we're doing it first for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| and not only for our students but for the educators in Knox County, and this is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| COVID has showed us a lot of challenges that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| And then secondly, I want to say thank you again for the commitment you have made for the educators of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5738)|
| 1:35:45| in regards to approving the amendment, a memorandum of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| between the Knox County Education Association and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| I know this has been a lengthy process that we have went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| but just know that this is the second time that you have approved a contract before the current contract expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5758)|
| 1:36:07| And we continuously want to have a working relationship with Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5767)|
| 1:36:14| As you know, you have nine people that represent you as it relates to working conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| and the seven other things that we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| But just know that your hard work and the people that represent you is their administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| They sit and talk on your behalf and we collaborate with the educators across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| And some of these challenges that we are presenting before that you all know too well is that we don't get paid enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5792)|
| 1:36:41| But just you should know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| You have made a concerted effort to actually raise our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| In the last five years that we've had a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| we have went from just those that are comparable to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| if you think about Williamson County, Davidson County, and those counties like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| we have went from being 11th to number four in raising our teachers' salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| Now, do we have a way to go? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Because we as Knox County, we want to be number one in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| But it's also going to take the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| So I want to say here that COVID shows the challenge about some of the resources that students desperately need in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5832)|
| 1:37:21| And with this continued collaboration with your educators across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| again, I can't say thank you enough to all of us, from all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| And knowing that we are continuing to work on this commitment to make sure that we are not only supporting the students in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| but you're supporting the educators as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Becca Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| If you'll just state your name and county of residence, then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5871)|
| 1:38:02| Becca Edwards, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you, Madam Chair and school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| I come to you today on behalf of the group of parents of Knox County students with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| who circulated a letter encouraging Knox County schools to reconsider its reopening plan regarding students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| Our effort garnered over 800 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| We are optimistic that our efforts will continue to cause KCS to be attentive to the unique needs of students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5902)|
| 1:38:31| We appreciate that the reopening plan will allow families to make informed decisions to attend school virtually or in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| after IEP teams have had an opportunity to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| We also appreciate that often virtual learners will be given access to on-campus, in-person services if determined appropriate by the IEP team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5921)|
| 1:38:50| Our focus now turns to a necessary understanding of what options are authorized by KCS for IEP teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5930)|
| 1:38:58| To consider when discussing supports and services described in the student's individualized education plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| We want to ensure that every child has access to the curriculum and a portion of students with disabilities will not have this access if there is a shift to virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| In other words, the reopening plan does not provide for the education of some of our most vulnerable students on red days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| The following is the forthcoming updated guidance from the Tennessee Department of Education as provided by the Director of Media at TDOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5961)|
| 1:39:29| If a local district moves to remote learning, the IEP team should meet to discuss the way in which services will be provided remotely and update the IEP as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5969)|
| 1:39:39| For some students, however, the IEP team might determine that the student is unable to access instruction remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| The team should consider whether a change in placement is warranted, which can include homebound instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| IEP teams might also consider bringing small groups into the school for face-to-face instruction with careful attention made to safety precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=5992)|
| 1:40:01| Please note that the KCS reopening plan precludes the possibility of services continuing to be provided in person if the district or the student's school is on a red day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6001)|
| 1:40:11| In other words, the plan runs afoul of the Department of Education's guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| Our son, Benton, is certainly one of the students who is unable to access instruction remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| Benton has autism and is nonverbal and, like last spring, will receive no services and support under the reopening plan if KCS shifts to red days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6022)|
| 1:40:32| If Benton's IEP team meets to develop a contingency plan in the event of an all-virtual learning district-wide shift or a shift at his school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6032)|
| 1:40:40| how will KCS staff members on the IEP team know what KCS will permit without clarity in the reopening plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| The state guidance clearly outlines that service delivery configurations are a local decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| But an IEP team certainly cannot make a decision to, say, send a one-to-one aide into the home or have that child and others with disabilities attend school with careful attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6054)|
| 1:41:04| made to safety precautions unless the IEP team knows what KCS will permit with respect to services and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| IEP teams are meeting across the district. However, they are meeting without adequate guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| The following are a few open questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| How will students with profound disabilities access the curriculum? How will we educate these students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| What menu of services and supports are available if the district or school is on a red day under the reopening plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| What happens to an aide that has already been funded and hired based on the IEP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| How is that aide to provide the service through a computer for a student who is clearly unable to access instruction or support remotely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| What happens to that position and the funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| You cannot simply leave it up to the IEP teams without informing parents and educators of the available options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| We understand that each plan is individualized, but the decisions made to meet the unique needs of our individual children require the menu of district-approved possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6118)|
| 1:42:08| That is what we are asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| We know what will happen to our kids without disabilities, and leaving it entirely up to the IEP team to decide absolutely any service delivery configuration is short-sighted at best and discriminatory in effect at worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6130)|
| 1:42:23| If it is left to the IEP teams, they may be forced to issue plans that cannot be implemented because KCS has failed to consider fully the services and supports that students with disabilities will require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6143)|
| 1:42:34| We respectfully request that KCS amend the reopening plan to provide more clarity with respect to students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| and provide an opportunity for in-person services, even on red days, in accordance with the Department of Education guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| Please do not leave these vulnerable children without access to services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Thank you, Ms. Fab. And that concludes our meeting. Meeting adjourned. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200812?start=6176)|
