| 2:53:37| And so for, you know, the 78% of adults with significant disabilities who don't have those jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10417)|
| 2:53:44| it's a very devastating blow, not only to them financially, but also to their self-esteem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10424)|
| 2:53:51| and to the workings and success of their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| So our services are meant to try to address those problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10435)|
| 2:54:00| those problems of unemployment and all that results from unemployment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| both in adults and in young people exiting the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10444)|
| 2:54:09| I'm very pleased to tell you that through our work that about 60% of all the adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10449)|
| 2:54:15| that we work with with significant disabilities have jobs now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| rather than that 22% national figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| and that a pilot project that we're involved in with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| has resulted in about 75% of young people with significant disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| exiting the school system with a job already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| as opposed to that 13% national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| So our services are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| They are making a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| and they're helping young people and adults with disabilities to be empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10486)|
| 2:54:51| and to be a part of our community as participants rather than as observers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10491)|
| 2:54:56| And they're allowing the remaining family members, the moms and dads and siblings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10496)|
| 2:55:01| to be able to function in a more normal way and to support themselves as a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10501)|
| 2:55:06| and not to need, you know, local and governmental resources to support the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10506)|
| 2:55:12| I've been the executive director of this agency for 32 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| and one thing that I think I can say is that I have perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10517)|
| 2:55:21| When I first started in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| people with significant disabilities were gathered together in one place, in buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| They were treated as individuals that really couldn't be part of society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10528)|
| 2:55:34| or part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| All the services were provided in group settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10536)|
| 2:55:40| And the thought was, the innocent, very well-meaning thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| was that all people with disabilities, significant disabilities, had similar needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| and so it would be more economic to provide these services in large groups and in facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10548)|
| 2:55:55| and that then they would get the special services they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| But what has really been learned over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| and where society has evolved to and where our community has evolved to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10563)|
| 2:56:08| and where the field of disability services has evolved to is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| people with disabilities, after all, are just people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10573)|
| 2:56:16| and they have a right and can be successful members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10576)|
| 2:56:22| And all we have to do is see the positive and not the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| And that's just a real powerful and also real simple change in people's mindset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10586)|
| 2:56:32| that if you look at all of us, we all have our own strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10592)|
| 2:56:35| and we have our own weaknesses, we have our abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| and we have things we're not real good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| And so the philosophy of our agency in the field of disability services today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10600)|
| 2:56:44| is to look at the positive and to see what people can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10604)|
| 2:56:49| and what talents and natural-born abilities and aptitudes people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| and then to work with that and then help them to get jobs that will be successful because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10613)|
| 2:56:59| help them to form relationships in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| to join civic organizations or trauma clubs, Kiwanis clubs, Lions clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10622)|
| 2:57:08| to help them develop hobbies and leisure activities that you and I are involved in and that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| And what we've learned is that when we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| and when people are a part of society and a part of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| then it is better for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| It's better for the entire community when everyone is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| So that's what our agency is up to these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| Our proposal, as you will see, says that we're working with about 75 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| in what we call day services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| Our agency also provides other services, such as residential services and family support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| but we're not asking for any financial assistance for those services, just our day services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| I want to thank you for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| And if there's any questions, I'll try to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10672)|
| 2:57:57| Seeing none, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10680)|
| 2:58:19| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| I'm Rhonda Rice, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| I'm the Executive Vice President of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| Commissioners, I appreciate you letting us tag along into this session today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| Obviously, we are not similar to some of the agencies that have been represented today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10713)|
| 2:58:39| and are not a part of the community grants funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| However, the Knoxville Chamber is a part of the contractual funding from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| However, I felt it was necessary and important for us to speak to you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| given that in the budget that has been proposed to you, the Chamber's funding has been decreased by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10732)|
| 2:59:02| And in order for us to be successful and continue our economic development efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| I wanted this opportunity to address you publicly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| The Knoxville Chamber provides a lot of the marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10750)|
| 2:59:13| and out front initiatives for economic development in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| And the Development Corporation, which will be following us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10757)|
| 2:59:21| provides those hard cost land and development opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| The Chamber provides the essential economic development services for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| We have been very fortunate and appreciative of the support and funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| that the Chamber has received in the last several years for our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10776)|
| 2:59:41| And what we have requested from Knox County is that we continue that same level of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| for our Innovation Valley Economic Development Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| In the total budget for Innovation Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| our request from Knox County represents about 14.5% of the overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10793)|
| 3:00:00| So that you know, the City of Knoxville has funded the Innovation Valley Program in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10800)|
| 3:00:06| and is continuing to do so in this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| Seventy percent of the funding for the Economic Development Program for Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10810)|
| 3:00:15| is from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| Private sector individuals have made a five-year commitment to this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| because they understand that it's a continuous program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| and that it must be maintained in order for us to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| Innovation Valley is a specific work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| The strategies and tactics that we have presented to you before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| in the meetings that we've had with you, both individually and as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10834)|
| 3:00:38| are very specific strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| We have industries that we have outlined and targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| There are sub-industries from those groups that we have also identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| as opportunities that we believe are possible to grow the economy here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10847)|
| 3:00:54| These sub-industries and consultants that we are approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10854)|
| 3:00:58| they take a continued work effort in order for us to make those matches and to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10858)|
| 3:01:05| The University of Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| are also helping us to identify growth opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| But in order for those to be successful, we have to have the resources to go to those shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| to meet with those consultants, to contact those companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| to be in front of them on a continuous basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10879)|
| 3:01:22| so that we can make sure that they understand that Knox County is open for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10882)|
| 3:01:27| and that we are looking for investments here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| If we do not continue the same level of funding that we have had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| we are going to have to look at this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| and identify areas that we're going to have to eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| We're going to have to look at opportunities that we have been very successful at in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| and see what's going to make sense in order for us to continue our momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10907)|
| 3:01:52| In this economy, as many of you have heard today and many have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| this is not the time that we need to stop selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| This is not the time to pull back and slow down in our momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| We have to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| We have to sustain that level of competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| because at the same time that we are working with recruiting new companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| there are other communities and other locations that are recruiting companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| right out from under us here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10934)|
| 3:02:18| Companies such as Goody's and White Lily and Rubbermaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| they're experiencing layoffs with their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| While these things are happening, we have to rebuild that pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| We want to make sure that we're keeping the job market as stable as we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10947)|
| 3:02:31| and providing new opportunities for job growth here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10951)|
| 3:02:37| Whether it's through supporting these existing industries, through new recruits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| through workforce development, we must be able to maintain that tax base in order to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10961)|
| 3:02:49| I think many of you have heard a recent announcement that we've had in the past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10969)|
| 3:02:54| about Green Mountain Coffee Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| I hope you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| There's still a few final details that we need to accomplish in order to make that a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10977)|
| 3:03:03| But this is a new company that is looking at investing $55 million in Knox County, creating 360 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10983)|
| 3:03:12| They identified Knoxville as a potential opportunity when they were doing their selective search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10992)|
| 3:03:19| In the fall of last year, the chamber, as part of its work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10999)|
| 3:03:24| we were a part of a consultant visitation trip in Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| In this deal, we go and we call in different groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| and we make sure they know about the opportunities that we have here in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| make sure they understand all the resources and assets that their companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| and clients can be successful in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| In February of this year, TVA, which is one of our partners in economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11022)|
| 3:03:48| they called and said they had a project that was looking at this area from Chattanooga to Middle Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| to East Tennessee, but thought Knoxville had a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11032)|
| 3:03:57| As soon as we saw who the consultant was on that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| we recognized it as one of the individuals that we had visited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| and made contact with through our visitation program with these site consultants in Chicago in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11043)|
| 3:04:09| Doug Lawyer immediately picked up the phone and started talking to that consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| and establishing that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11052)|
| 3:04:15| In doing so, he steered them toward a building in the forks of the River Industrial Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11055)|
| 3:04:20| a 334,000 building that had been available and on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11060)|
| 3:04:24| The company had moved out and jobs had been lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| This was an opportunity for a new company to locate here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11067)|
| 3:04:32| It's been a very fast-paced project, and all the final details, as I said, are not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11072)|
| 3:04:38| But once they are done, we will have a new corporate citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| and I think you will see a return on investment for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| unlike anything that we have seen in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| They're working with local contractors, local architects, suppliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| A lot of individual both direct and indirect jobs will be created from this recent company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11091)|
| 3:04:59| There's also a lot of talk and speculation about a certain automotive manufacturer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| looking at an assembly plant in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| If this project does happen, and a lot of people from the state of Tennessee feel very positive about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| if we are fortunate enough and that assembly plant does happen in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| Knox County stands to benefit significantly from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| We are in a prime location and in a great target area for suppliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| and other companies that would be directly related to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| to locate up and down the I-75 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| We must be prepared. We must have the land. We must have the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11133)|
| 3:05:37| We must have the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| I encourage you to look at the Innovation Valley Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| to ask us any questions, but that you continue to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| and fund the Knoxville Chamber's Innovation Valley Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| at the same level that we have had in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| Thank you for this opportunity, and I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11153)|
| 3:05:59| Commissioner, I promise to keep it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| You were arguing here for the Innovation Valley Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| where it was shorted $200,000 from what you'd asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11164)|
| 3:06:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11167)|
| 3:06:08| Also up here on the Knoxville Chamber, it was about $40,000 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11173)|
| 3:06:14| You want them both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| I would be reticent if I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| However, we are willing and we can certainly understand the need to tighten our belt in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11179)|
| 3:06:24| and we're willing to do that and understand the needs for that $40,000 cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| I think the Innovation Valley Program is the area that I would like you to really focus on and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11188)|
| 3:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11196)|
| 3:06:42| Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11206)|
| 3:06:47| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11207)|
| 3:06:48| My name is Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| I'm the Executive Vice President of Development Corporation in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| We're located at 17 Market Square, No. 201, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11213)|
| 3:06:58| I want to take this opportunity just to talk a little bit about who the Development Corporation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| and what we do, and I promise not to take more than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| Let me thank you for funding the Development Corporation of Knox County since 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11226)|
| 3:07:12| The reason in 1991 is because that's when Knox County chartered the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11232)|
| 3:07:18| A read from our charter says to cooperate and act jointly with the county in the promotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| and stimulation of economic community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| It was decided at that time the Development Corporation would be set up as a 501c3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11245)|
| 3:07:30| not-for-profit, with its own board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| But that board has a direct tie back to Knox County and Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| Of those 11 members, the Chairman of Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| who obviously is Tank Strickland, serves on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| The Chairman of the Intergovernmental Committee, Craig Luthold, serves on that board presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| And the Chair of the Finance Committee, Paul Pinkson, serves on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| as well as Mayor Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11271)|
| 3:07:54| So as you see, there's still a lot of involvement in Knox County, even though we have an independent board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| And it's that board of directors who governs how we operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| and what it is we do on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| In Knox County, other than Forks of the River Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| there has not been any industrial or business parks in which the Development Corporation has not been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11290)|
| 3:08:16| It's the Development Corporation that has developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| and manages five business parks on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| And the availability and management of those parks is critical to our ongoing economic well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11301)|
| 3:08:27| Just within the Development Corporation-developed business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11307)|
| 3:08:32| there are over 5,000 people employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| In addition, on the I-275 business park, which the Development Corporation was involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11315)|
| 3:08:41| there's another 250 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| And when you look at Forks of the River Industrial Park, that's 4,700 people in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11323)|
| 3:08:48| Through the county's efforts, through itself, or the Development Corporation of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| there are 10,000 people-over 10,000 people-employed in these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11331)|
| 3:08:58| We don't only do industrial and business parks and management of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| We also perform many other functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| We manage Knox County's business incubator, which is called Fairview Technology Center, located in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11345)|
| 3:09:11| Since its inception, over 50 technology companies have been able to start up and get going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11351)|
| 3:09:17| I want to mention two, one of which is NukeSafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| a company that's involved in the development of technology and equipment that protects our airports and our borders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11360)|
| 3:09:29| not only in the United States but across the world, from what's nuclear sources for what's called dirty bombs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11369)|
| 3:09:35| They employ 74 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| Protein Discovery started at Fairview Technology Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11377)|
| 3:09:41| They're located right here in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| And they develop technology and equipment used to help bring to test pharmaceuticals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11384)|
| 3:09:49| that are coming to the market to improve people's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| And they employ 11 high-tech, well-paid employees, and they're continuing to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11392)|
| 3:09:59| We manage Knox County's manufacturing and industrial skills programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| It gives the people to increase their skills in technology areas which are in high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11403)|
| 3:10:09| Ultimately, that equates back to them to more value to their employer, higher wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| And the beauty of that program is they carry those skills with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| If something happens to the employer, they don't lose those skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| They take those to another company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| Or if it makes more sense for them to make more wages, they can take that to another company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| And since 1999, over 4,700 people have been trained through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11428)|
| 3:10:33| We serve as this county's staff for its Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| Health, Education, and Housing Facility Boards, and manage all those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11436)|
| 3:10:41| In 2000, the Development Corporation began serving as Knox County's Joint Economic and Community Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11441)|
| 3:10:47| which was mandated by the growth legislation in Chapter 1101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11447)|
| 3:10:52| That's an important board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| And what that means to this county is that if we don't continue serving in that role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| and that function does not happen, this county does not have access to THDA grants through the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| industrial infrastructure and training grants, T21 grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| which are used extensively to create alternative means of transportation, sidewalks, greenway trails, and tourism grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11466)|
| 3:11:18| Those are all that board has to meet and maintain that function for us to be eligible for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11478)|
| 3:11:24| And when a company is considering to locate or expand in Knox County, it's the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11484)|
| 3:11:29| along with the Knoxville Chamber, that answers the phones, that responds to emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11489)|
| 3:11:33| that staffs the offices and mentors the economic development programs on behalf of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11493)|
| 3:11:39| We have proposed a budget to Knox County in the amount of funding of $1,066,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11499)|
| 3:11:46| which represents 90% of our total operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| The other 10% comes from the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| which was part of the growth management agreement between the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11512)|
| 3:11:58| And we've worked within this total operating budget basically for the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11518)|
| 3:12:03| What was proposed was that we would receive $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11523)|
| 3:12:08| It's a $166,000 cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| This would then also equate to a cut from the city of Knoxville of about $18,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11531)|
| 3:12:16| about a $185,000 cut in total, which is not insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11536)|
| 3:12:21| So what I hope is that you can see is the Development Corporation serves a vital role for ongoing economic health of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11541)|
| 3:12:29| and requests your continued support from commission that's necessary for us to maintain these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11549)|
| 3:12:36| and provide your economic development staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| And I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| Mr. Napier, do you think the 10% that the city pays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| is that a fair share of what you'd provide for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11568)|
| 3:12:53| 10% seems small to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| Well, it's what was agreed to between the city and the county, and that's the current contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| I will say that other than we manage Brookside Mills site, which is about a 19-acre site in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11581)|
| 3:13:09| and then we provide some services to the city's Industrial Development Board, which they give us some funding for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| almost all the property management that we do is all of it's within the county except for the Brookside Mills site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11595)|
| 3:13:22| So I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11602)|
| 3:13:28| Why are you even here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11608)|
| 3:13:33| Why are you even here when this isn't a community grant, this is a contractual grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| Well, that occurred to us about 10.30 this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| There's been some discussion in regard to how to, for you all, might cure problems that you're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11626)|
| 3:13:56| And when we looked at the budget process, we were not part of the county's line item budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11636)|
| 3:14:06| At the city, we're in the mayor's office budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| We're not in grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| And yet we felt that it was in your best interest and our best interest for everybody to understand clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11653)|
| 3:14:21| and to ask us these questions as to what we're doing and the implication of taking $166,000 out of an operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11661)|
| 3:14:33| that has, as though it has no consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| It is not a matter of tightening the belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11676)|
| 3:14:39| We've kept this budget flat for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11679)|
| 3:14:45| It's not, it does have consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| In regard to Innovation Valley, usually it's about a 50-50 split between the public side and the private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11690)|
| 3:15:03| Here in the Innovation Valley, the private dollars are going to be 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11703)|
| 3:15:08| It's going to be a very aggressive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| It is an added workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11710)|
| 3:15:12| In addition to the recruitment, it's got a number of programs, and I think you've all seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11712)|
| 3:15:17| And 14.5% of a five-year program is pretty good leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11717)|
| 3:15:26| If you add the cities and then 70% of the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| and that is a core mission of any government to try to make sure that you're going to have jobs in a community that are going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11731)|
| 3:15:39| Rhonda mentioned several companies that are sort of easy ones to mention that are leaving or have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11739)|
| 3:15:50| This is going to be a very aggressive, changing economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11750)|
| 3:15:55| And if we don't stay out there, one of the greatest stories, William, you may have remembered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11755)|
| 3:16:06| About eight years ago, nine years ago, Austin, Texas, was the most phenomenal example of the new American economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11766)|
| 3:16:18| And there wasn't any state or any municipality that wasn't looking at Boston or, more importantly, Austin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11778)|
| 3:16:25| and saying those are the folks who are riding the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11785)|
| 3:16:32| The problem was two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11792)|
| 3:16:33| One, they started to believe their own press, and they quit doing all their economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11793)|
| 3:16:40| They quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| Number two, dot-com tanked, and they tanked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11803)|
| 3:16:48| The guy that they finally brought in was a guy that used to be in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11808)|
| 3:16:54| And I called him one day, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| I'm looking at something right now that shows that we have fallen below Hattiesburg, Mississippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11816)|
| 3:17:03| It's taken them about five years to get back into the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11823)|
| 3:17:08| These relationships that Rhonda mentioned, it is very important to know these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11828)|
| 3:17:15| and to be able to call them and have the confidence in you that they will work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| and you're not going to mess up their deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| Another example was Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| For one budget, the Memphis government got upside down with their chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11846)|
| 3:17:31| They cut it all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| And the headline about this time last year was, and this was the headline in the Memphis paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11854)|
| 3:17:41| Memphis dead last in economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| And now they've put together a huge economic development program that is very aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11864)|
| 3:17:53| But, man, they waited until they got to the tank to try to turn this thing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11873)|
| 3:17:59| You just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11879)|
| 3:18:02| You just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| And I didn't answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11885)|
| 3:18:08| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11888)|
| 3:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| We have six people for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| First is Donna McGilvers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11898)|
| 3:18:39| Whoa, what a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| And you guys still have budget hearings to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| You have my sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11924)|
| 3:18:46| I'm going home and get in the pool after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11926)|
| 3:18:50| My name is Donna McGilvers, 12630 Early Drive, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11930)|
| 3:18:56| I have just a point or two that I want to make before I give my little talk after sitting here all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11936)|
| 3:19:03| I would ask, if you haven't already done so, that you review salaries on these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11943)|
| 3:19:15| I'd like to give just a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| These are the two top salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| Legal aid, requested $10,000, received none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11960)|
| 3:19:25| Top two salaries, $130,000 and $111,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11965)|
| 3:19:31| Boys and Girls Club, they requested $47,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11971)|
| 3:19:35| They received $31,725.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11975)|
| 3:19:39| Top salaries, $119,000, $84,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11979)|
| 3:19:45| Free Medical Clinic, requested $20,000, received none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| $150,000, $42,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11990)|
| 3:19:56| Chamber, what we just heard on development, Knox Area Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=11996)|
| 3:20:03| Top salary, $216,000, almost $217,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12003)|
| 3:20:09| Second salary, $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| And they're asking for a lot of money from the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12012)|
| 3:20:15| I hope you'll look at the salaries before you make any decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12015)|
| 3:20:20| I had the privilege of serving as the chairperson for the Social Services Panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12020)|
| 3:20:25| one of the five groups which reviewed the grant requests made by charitable organizations to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12025)|
| 3:20:31| There were 12 panelists in our group, and we reviewed 41 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12031)|
| 3:20:36| We met four times following the initial receipt of the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12036)|
| 3:20:40| At our first meeting, we scored the applicants on the narrative portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12040)|
| 3:20:44| which we had read prior to coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| In order to have a consistent comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| each applicant was required to provide information in specific categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12049)|
| 3:20:55| One, project program description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| Two, community need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| Three, funding need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Four, support and commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| Five, timeline for implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| Six, budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| Seven, overall application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12070)|
| 3:21:13| This method is similar to the information requested by United Way for their grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12073)|
| 3:21:18| An applicant could receive a total score of 20 to 100 points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12078)|
| 3:21:22| depending on the completeness of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12082)|
| 3:21:26| Each panelist verbally announced their score, which was recorded by Mr. Hoagland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12086)|
| 3:21:31| Needless to say, there was some discussion by panelists during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12091)|
| 3:21:37| Our second and third meetings were held to entertain oral presentations by the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12097)|
| 3:21:42| Each applicant was given five minutes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| followed by a question and answer session, sorely lacking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12105)|
| 3:21:51| Following each question and answer session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| the panelists were asked to score the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12114)|
| 3:21:57| Again, the scores could range from 20 to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| Most scores were close to the narrative scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12121)|
| 3:22:05| At our final meeting, each panelist was asked to give a recommended percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| of requested funding for each applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| This percentage ranged from 0% to 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12132)|
| 3:22:17| Mr. Hoagland recorded each response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| It was at this last meeting that we were told how much money was available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12140)|
| 3:22:24| to the social services panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| We had reviewed 41 applications, with a total amount requested of $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12147)|
| 3:22:34| We were given only $475,000 to disperse among the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12154)|
| 3:22:41| The agencies were ranked by a combination of their narrative and interview scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12161)|
| 3:22:46| Based on their standings, each agency was allocated the percentage assigned by the panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12166)|
| 3:22:52| and that was the percentage divided by 10 members at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| When the allotted funds were exhausted, we had to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| Unfortunately, this meant that there were agencies which did not receive any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12180)|
| 3:23:06| In a perfect world with unlimited resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12186)|
| 3:23:10| in a perfect world with unlimited resources, I feel I have to repeat that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12190)|
| 3:23:15| we would have been provided with the financial means to fund all of the requests submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12195)|
| 3:23:21| However, just as each one of us must live within our financial boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| so too did all the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| Funds were allocated in the most equitable manner possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12210)|
| 3:23:35| There were no hidden agendas or political pressures among any of the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12215)|
| 3:23:41| Our meetings were held in a fair and open forum in strict compliance with the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12221)|
| 3:23:49| I am asking each of the commissioners to please support the recommendations as put forth by the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12229)|
| 3:23:56| If you do find a means to increase funding, I would ask you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| where are the additional funds to come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| How will these funds be dispersed among the unfunded charitable organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| Commissioner Hammer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12255)|
| 3:24:18| First of all, thank you for your service and thank you for spending the amount of time that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| and it's obvious that you all put a lot of thought into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| You just didn't meet one day and say, oh, let's do this or draw names out of a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12264)|
| 3:24:28| You had a deliberate way that you looked at this, and thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12268)|
| 3:24:31| I do have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| Some of these folks or organizations that more than doubled in the amount that they received last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12273)|
| 3:24:41| I know I have a question about the fact that if someone received like $25,000 in last year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12281)|
| 3:24:48| and now they're going to double that with your recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| what was the thought process behind giving them as much as twice the amount that they had received before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12292)|
| 3:25:01| I know that that had requests, but as to what they actually got last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12301)|
| 3:25:05| and what you're recommending this year, in some cases it was more than double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12305)|
| 3:25:10| I'm just familiar with any of the grants that we might have handled in social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12310)|
| 3:25:15| My guess would be by reading over the narrative, the information provided by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12315)|
| 3:25:22| they had to justify why they were seeking additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12322)|
| 3:25:29| And then they were scored accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12329)|
| 3:25:32| I don't know how else to answer that, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12332)|
| 3:25:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| But we had the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| We had to review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12338)|
| 3:25:39| We had to look and see how they could justify this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12339)|
| 3:25:43| And then, of course, the oral presentations were a great help as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| and the Q&A that followed in deciding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| And you realize that by scoring them, that was how we actually got them in the order from high to low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12349)|
| 3:25:58| And then they were funded based on the percentages that came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12358)|
| 3:26:05| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| Yes, I second Commissioner Hammond on all of the volunteers who went through and reviewed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12368)|
| 3:26:14| I know that that was many, many hours of work on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12374)|
| 3:26:17| I do have a question, and Donna, maybe you can help me out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12377)|
| 3:26:23| When I look at the column for average funding percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| and then I look at the column where it mentions the overall score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| Okay, let me get a sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| You don't have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12394)|
| 3:26:35| I have them back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12396)|
| 3:26:50| You'll have to keep in mind I have not looked at the applications since they were all turned in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| so I don't recall details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12414)|
| 3:26:56| You're talking about the social funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| Yes, the social funding recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12420)|
| 3:27:01| The overall scores, like were they, I guess that was the average of the application score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12421)|
| 3:27:07| and the average of the interview score?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12427)|
| 3:27:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12430)|
| 3:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12431)|
| 3:27:12| The top one, their child and family Tennessee, received an overall score of 89.83%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12432)|
| 3:27:20| Then over in the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12440)|
| 3:27:21| Yes, it's not a percent, that is a score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| A score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12444)|
| 3:27:25| Then in the next column it says that the average funding percentage was 97.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12445)|
| 3:27:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| Now what I don't understand, and if you could clarify this for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| down for the Cerebral Palsy Housing Corporation, their overall score was 84.36%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12456)|
| 3:27:43| That was their score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12463)|
| 3:27:44| However, they were funded 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| Can you explain why those don't seem parallel or those don't seem to correlate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12467)|
| 3:27:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12472)|
| 3:27:55| When we scored on the narrative in the interview, those were number scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12475)|
| 3:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12480)|
| 3:28:01| Then we were asked at the last meeting to give a percentage of how much of the amount requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12481)|
| 3:28:09| each individual panelist would be willing to allocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| So if, for example, on child and family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| you could have had a rate of percentage anywhere from 0% of funding by a panelist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12498)|
| 3:28:25| to 100% of funding by a panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| We all put in our percentages, divided them through by 10 at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12509)|
| 3:28:34| We had 10 members and came up with 97.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| So the column where it says the average funding percentage then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12518)|
| 3:28:43| what I'm taking is really at the end of the whole process that you encountered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12523)|
| 3:28:49| that was the average of the percent in summation of what each individual would have allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12529)|
| 3:28:56| to that particular grant applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| That is the percentage that you take what each panelist said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12541)|
| 3:29:06| which ranged anywhere from 0% to 100%, divide it through by 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12546)|
| 3:29:10| you come up with 97.5 in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12554)|
| 3:29:15| Which meant that they were, instead of getting the full 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12555)|
| 3:29:18| they were only going to get 97.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12558)|
| 3:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12560)|
| 3:29:21| In cerebral palsy, we all came across at 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12561)|
| 3:29:25| It seems to me, though, that the final determiner then on recommending the funding amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12565)|
| 3:29:33| was really reflective on the average funding percentages and not on the overall score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12573)|
| 3:29:39| Is that a fair assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12579)|
| 3:29:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12582)|
| 3:29:43| The overall score helped place the agency, one through whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12583)|
| 3:29:49| We had 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12589)|
| 3:29:50| So one through 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| One through 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12592)|
| 3:29:53| This is how you got ranked was by your score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| The funding that you were going to get was by percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12596)|
| 3:30:05| I mean, if you went and looked at this and went through it alphabetically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12605)|
| 3:30:09| which is when we had our applications, they were in the notebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| and basically they were in our notebook alphabetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12612)|
| 3:30:16| Well, you would have had maybe like the YWCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12616)|
| 3:30:20| which ended up getting 92.5% of their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| They would have been way at the end, right, because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12623)|
| 3:30:28| The Alansia del Pueblo would have been the very first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12628)|
| 3:30:32| and as a matter of fact, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12632)|
| 3:30:34| And you can see they scored very low overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12634)|
| 3:30:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12637)|
| 3:30:38| So no funding, besides the fact that we ran out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| Yes, you made it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12646)|
| 3:30:47| I guess just the process confuses me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| I don't know if any of the commissioners are following my line of thought on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| but it just seems to me that the average funding percentages was the summary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12652)|
| 3:31:01| your personal designation where the overall score seemed to be follow a more rigid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12661)|
| 3:31:09| rubric or standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12669)|
| 3:31:12| Well, the scoring, I mean, that was a number of 20 through 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12672)|
| 3:31:17| That was the score, and it was based on the application, narrative portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12677)|
| 3:31:23| and on the interview and the Q&A that followed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| That was a score between 20 and 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12686)|
| 3:31:28| Now, when you start looking at percentage, you could go from 0%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| which in some cases, some of our panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12692)|
| 3:31:35| when they were asked about a particular agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12695)|
| 3:31:38| what would be your recommended funding amount or percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| Zero percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12703)|
| 3:31:44| The person sitting to my right might have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12704)|
| 3:31:46| gee, I think that would be funded 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12706)|
| 3:31:49| And Donna, again, don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| You're just the first one who came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| So this is just questions that I have about not just this one but all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12713)|
| 3:31:57| and I thank you for helping me figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12719)|
| 3:32:00| I'm glad to try and help you out if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12720)|
| 3:32:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| Donna, again, appreciate what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| You really jumped in it with both feet, and I think you've done a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12729)|
| 3:32:13| I've done a lot of this through other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12733)|
| 3:32:16| and I feel I know what I'm going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12736)|
| 3:32:19| I attended a lot of the panels, did not get to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| I was curious about one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| When you guys looked at their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| did you take into consideration how much they were asking for versus how much their board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12745)|
| 3:32:33| Let's say I'm the American Cancer Society, and I'm wanting $100,000 from the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12753)|
| 3:32:40| How much does my board of directors, how much do they do in special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12760)|
| 3:32:44| How much do they raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12764)|
| 3:32:46| Are they doing their part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| Are they pulling up and doing most of the fundraising and just asking for a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12769)|
| 3:32:54| or are they wanting Knox County to just carry the load for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| and their board of directors raise $10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| There was a portion in the application where you were asked about your funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| What were your other sources of funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| We didn't have dollar amounts from the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| Many of them had other resources that they were going to, no dollar amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12793)|
| 3:33:19| All we could base that on was, well, you're asking for $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12799)|
| 3:33:23| but your grant request is only for 10%, which is $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12803)|
| 3:33:27| You have other sources of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12807)|
| 3:33:29| You're out there fundraising, or you're getting other grants, or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12809)|
| 3:33:33| They're picking up the $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| They're picking up the slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12815)|
| 3:33:36| So, well, okay, that doesn't look too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| That may be something you want to look at next year, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| We'll just see how much that they bring to the table also themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12821)|
| 3:33:46| That the board of directors bring to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12826)|
| 3:33:48| That they do in their special events and fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12828)|
| 3:33:51| I'm not counting the grant work, the grants that they ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| because to me that's just give me, give me, give me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12833)|
| 3:33:57| If the board of directors feels strong about that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12837)|
| 3:34:00| they need to be out there raising the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12840)|
| 3:34:02| And if the public supports it, they need to be out here giving money to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12842)|
| 3:34:06| I don't care if Knox County wants to give some money to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12846)|
| 3:34:09| but I don't want Knox County to be the main source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12849)|
| 3:34:13| It just makes the lazy board of directors what it ends up doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12853)|
| 3:34:17| We did have a few organizations on social services where they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12857)|
| 3:34:22| they've been coming back to Knox County year after year after year looking for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12862)|
| 3:34:28| And, I mean, there does come a point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12868)|
| 3:34:30| where you've got to be able to stand on your own two feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12870)|
| 3:34:34| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12874)|
| 3:34:35| Thank you for the advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| Yes, Donna, I know you put in a lot of hours and you can't please everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| But you said you just stopped when you got out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12885)|
| 3:34:46| Does the need of these grants have anything to do with the way you picked them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12886)|
| 3:34:53| In other words, what I'm concerned about is we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12893)|
| 3:34:57| just like the free medical clinic over here in south Knoxville, there's a need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12897)|
| 3:35:04| But yet you didn't give them anything, but yet the restoration of the Tennessee Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12904)|
| 3:35:10| you funded them, you funded this horse haven of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12910)|
| 3:35:14| I see that there's a lot of things it looks like you funded that there's a greater need for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12914)|
| 3:35:19| Okay, I'll speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12919)|
| 3:35:22| Now, the free clinic was in the health category, so I didn't review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12922)|
| 3:35:29| But, once again, every panel, every group, we all scored the same way, different numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12929)|
| 3:35:37| but our scoring was all done the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| Percentages were all handled the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| And then at that last meeting for each panel, you were told how much money you could disperse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12941)|
| 3:35:46| and when that money was gone, it was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12946)|
| 3:35:49| Free Clinic of America, by the time it got down to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12949)|
| 3:35:53| there were three other organizations ahead of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12953)|
| 3:35:56| there was no more money for the health panel to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12956)|
| 3:35:59| Yes, but what I'm saying is it looks like we funded things that there's greater need for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12959)|
| 3:36:03| Here's another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12963)|
| 3:36:04| Now, let me ask you, you just said you split it up into three panels, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12964)|
| 3:36:09| No, sir, there were five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12969)|
| 3:36:10| There were five, and you only reviewed certain things in your panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12974)|
| 3:36:15| You didn't score these other four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12977)|
| 3:36:18| I know another panel did, but these scores may have been different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12978)|
| 3:36:23| if you had scored on every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12983)|
| 3:36:26| If you had sat in on every panel, you may have scored some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12986)|
| 3:36:30| that were lower in the other panels, you may have given them a higher score, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12990)|
| 3:36:35| Well, as an individual, had I looked at all 141 applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12995)|
| 3:36:39| certainly I may have scored differently from the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=12999)|
| 3:36:43| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13003)|
| 3:36:44| So, really, this really wasn't very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| In my opinion, it wasn't very accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| because you did not hear about the other panels on their need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13010)|
| 3:36:56| or what they were doing for the community, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| No, sir, we were divided into five panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13020)|
| 3:37:04| Okay, what panel did you sit on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| I sat on the social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13026)|
| 3:37:08| All right, the other four panels, did you sit in on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| No, sir, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| No, but what I'm trying to say is, ma'am, I didn't sit on any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13032)|
| 3:37:16| but did you vote to score any of the other panels at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13036)|
| 3:37:21| No, sir, only on the social funding, on the applications that I reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13041)|
| 3:37:26| But if everyone, I've sat here and listened to every one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| I think there's a need for some of them that was not funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13050)|
| 3:37:33| and not a need for some of them that were funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| And what I'm trying to say is, if you had sat on all five panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| and everybody had sat on all five panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| the scores may have been different, would they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13064)|
| 3:37:45| Let me step in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13065)|
| 3:37:46| Each panel had their own monies and each panel had their own system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13066)|
| 3:37:50| No, the system was the same, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13070)|
| 3:37:52| Let me correct myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| It might have been the same system, but each panel had their own monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13074)|
| 3:37:57| But you may have voted for one and give them a 70%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13077)|
| 3:38:00| and I may have thought the need there was to give them a 77% if I had heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13080)|
| 3:38:04| the needs of that panel, too, is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13084)|
| 3:38:07| But everybody within her social services heard everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13087)|
| 3:38:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13090)|
| 3:38:12| Yes, sir, regarding social services, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13092)|
| 3:38:14| So I wouldn't know anything about tourism because that was totally separate money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13094)|
| 3:38:21| Did I kind of correct it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| I think it's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| You know how I feel about it, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| I would say one thing, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| I believe the method that each one of these panels went through is far better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13113)|
| 3:38:38| and more fair than what you have just spent today doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13118)|
| 3:38:42| hearing a five-minute oral presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| Donna, thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| I appreciate all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| I'm just sort of curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| Who told you how much money you were going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13141)|
| 3:39:04| Who determined that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13144)|
| 3:39:06| We were told at the last meeting that the finance director, Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13146)|
| 3:39:11| had passed the information to community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13151)|
| 3:39:15| Eric Hoagland told us the dollar amount that we had to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13155)|
| 3:39:21| If you had had more money to distribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13161)|
| 3:39:27| I don't want to call it spend, I want to call it distribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13167)|
| 3:39:33| would you have given more money to the ones that received some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13173)|
| 3:39:37| or would you have just gone further down the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13177)|
| 3:39:40| We would have gone further down the list until we ran out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| So you wouldn't have said some of them that you might have thought might be more deserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13185)|
| 3:39:52| wouldn't have got a higher percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13192)|
| 3:39:54| you would have just gotten more agencies at least some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13194)|
| 3:39:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13198)|
| 3:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13199)|
| 3:40:03| Because I was curious as we heard a lot of these groups come up before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13203)|
| 3:40:11| and you just sort of explained that a little bit to me, I guess I get it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13211)|
| 3:40:15| because some of them were saying, well, we were slated to get some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13215)|
| 3:40:18| but then we ran out, and I didn't understand that until just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13218)|
| 3:40:23| so I appreciate you answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| Did they give any explanation as to why that's all the money your group got versus others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13226)|
| 3:40:37| We were told there was a total of $2 million that was going to be split among the five groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13237)|
| 3:40:44| And I say split, not evenly, because we had 41 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13244)|
| 3:40:48| Another group had fewer applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13248)|
| 3:40:51| So that's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| Our particular panel, we were told we had $475,000 that we could donate or assign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13253)|
| 3:41:02| And when it was gone, it was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13262)|
| 3:41:07| Unfortunately, I only got three out of the five of these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| I don't know what happened to the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| I mean, you can see we wanted to, you know, when you look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13276)|
| 3:41:20| we wanted to fund everybody at least something, because they're all worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13280)|
| 3:41:25| And I appreciate that systematic way of going through it, but I guess in my own mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13285)|
| 3:41:31| and it's just a matter of how you want to split it, and it's probably just splitting hairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| but I would have thought I would have given the ones I felt were absolutely needed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13295)|
| 3:41:44| I would have tried to help them out more than maybe some of them at the very bottom that maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13304)|
| 3:41:50| instead of maybe someone who's asked for $10,000 and instead of giving them $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13310)|
| 3:41:57| I think I would have rather given that $1,000 to someone that I thought really needed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13317)|
| 3:42:03| and instead of giving them $9,000, give them the whole $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13323)|
| 3:42:07| Because I would have thought that $1,000 would have been better for and better spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13327)|
| 3:42:13| with the one that I felt was more worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13333)|
| 3:42:17| Do you understand my thinking on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13339)|
| 3:42:20| I would say that I think the way we did it, though, was a far more fair and equitable method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13340)|
| 3:42:26| Well, and I'm just saying that's how I would have, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13346)|
| 3:42:31| is that I'd rather spend a dollar very wisely than maybe on one that wasn't quite as wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13351)|
| 3:42:40| But I'm not, that's just my sort of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| But I think all of ours were wise choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| And I'm not saying that they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| I'm just saying that's just two different approaches as to how you could go through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13367)|
| 3:42:51| and I think that might be how some of these commissioners are taking a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13371)|
| 3:42:56| I appreciate what you all have done, every single one of the panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13376)|
| 3:43:00| and I'm going to take your recommendations very, very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13380)|
| 3:43:05| and be a major factor on how I decide how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13385)|
| 3:43:09| But I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13389)|
| 3:43:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13390)|
| 3:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13391)|
| 3:43:12| Mr. Chairman, can I answer his real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13392)|
| 3:43:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13394)|
| 3:43:15| Craig, one thing that they looked at on the panels, you say $10,000, give them $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13395)|
| 3:43:20| They want to fund the full project or nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13400)|
| 3:43:23| In other words, if some of the groups, if you gave them $1,000, that wouldn't do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13403)|
| 3:43:27| They couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| So, you know, they wanted to do as much of the project as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| And they couldn't give them just a tiny bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| Yeah, and that's why I get back to giving someone $1,000, it may not even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13413)|
| 3:43:41| they may not even do what they were wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13421)|
| 3:43:44| so you might as well have spent that $1,000 somewhere that it could be more helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13424)|
| 3:43:48| And I'm not saying you got, and that's taking something at the very bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13428)|
| 3:43:51| So, you know, some of those that were sort of halfway down, it might be very worthwhile to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13431)|
| 3:43:56| So I'm not trying to say, I'm just trying to get down to the nitty-gritty here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13436)|
| 3:44:00| And I guess, and maybe Donna, you're not the right one to ask how they decided it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13440)|
| 3:44:07| but I'm curious as to, because you mentioned the number of applicants that you went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13447)|
| 3:44:12| but I was wondering if they took a look at how much dollars requested were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13452)|
| 3:44:19| And I guess that's probably, because you could have 40 and have $1 million being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13459)|
| 3:44:28| and you could have 40 and have $2 million requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13468)|
| 3:44:32| So I'm not sure if that's how they decided it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13472)|
| 3:44:36| and that's probably just something I'll have to ask John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13476)|
| 3:44:39| Oh, yeah, I have no idea how finance arrived at, you know, the $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13479)|
| 3:44:44| But thank you, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13484)|
| 3:44:46| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13486)|
| 3:44:49| He's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13489)|
| 3:44:50| Thank you, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13490)|
| 3:44:52| He's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| Commissioner Moore, glad to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13494)|
| 3:44:58| Donna, and I'll echo what, oh, here, on this side, echo what everyone else has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13498)|
| 3:45:04| We appreciate what the panel's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| It's a lot of time, and we do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13506)|
| 3:45:10| I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13510)|
| 3:45:11| One of them, did you all take into consideration what the city of Knoxville may have given some of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13511)|
| 3:45:19| in their grant process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| We didn't know what the city of Knoxville gave to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13521)|
| 3:45:24| Okay, so you don't know if they did or did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13524)|
| 3:45:28| Secondly, did you kind of weigh what some of these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13528)|
| 3:45:34| say if the county uses taxpayer dollars to give to an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| did you weigh if they were not funded what it would cost the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13538)|
| 3:45:44| And I know it's hard to say which one I'd use, Helen Ross McNabb, Child and Family Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13544)|
| 3:45:50| But looking at, say, Helen Ross McNabb helping someone, or they end up in jail or somewhere like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13550)|
| 3:45:57| that increases the cost to the taxpayers on the county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13557)|
| 3:46:00| did you all take into consideration if these organizations weren't funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13560)|
| 3:46:04| that someone else either picks up the bill for them on the county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13564)|
| 3:46:08| or if they end up incarcerated or in a hospital that someone has to pay the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13568)|
| 3:46:14| You know, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13574)|
| 3:46:16| Personally, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13576)|
| 3:46:19| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| You know, I just felt, number one, I would have liked to have given them all their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13581)|
| 3:46:26| but we are living in tight budget times countywide and at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13586)|
| 3:46:33| And, you know, even charitable organizations sometimes have to pull on the belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13593)|
| 3:46:39| and maybe they can't operate a program or make cuts in an existing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13599)|
| 3:46:45| Personally, I didn't think about that aspect at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13605)|
| 3:46:49| Okay, because, you know, if we're giving away taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| we need to make sure that we give it where it really affects on the county side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13611)|
| 3:46:57| I mean, you know, if we give an organization per dollar, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13617)|
| 3:47:02| and it saves the county $14, you know, that's probably a good give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13622)|
| 3:47:07| But if we give someone something that the county doesn't even have to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13627)|
| 3:47:10| or if it's just for something that's nominal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13630)|
| 3:47:14| we ought to spend our money wisely, as you say, in a tough budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13634)|
| 3:47:18| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13638)|
| 3:47:19| That was a good question, but I personally did not even consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13639)|
| 3:47:23| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13645)|
| 3:47:29| Again, let me ñ I'd be remiss if I didn't thank you all for all that you did for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13649)|
| 3:47:36| But let me ask, I think, Commissioner DeFries' question in another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13656)|
| 3:47:41| because I do agree with her in that you had a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13661)|
| 3:47:48| and you had a basis that you went through in three meetings to determine this interview score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13668)|
| 3:47:55| You had the six things that you looked at, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13675)|
| 3:47:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13678)|
| 3:47:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13679)|
| 3:48:00| Then at the last meeting you were asked to give a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13680)|
| 3:48:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13684)|
| 3:48:05| What was the basis of that percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13685)|
| 3:48:08| It couldn't have been, in my mind, it couldn't have been those six things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13688)|
| 3:48:12| because those six things are what led to, in this case, you know, just picking one out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13692)|
| 3:48:17| those six things led to the University of Tennessee V-Power Training Seminar to get a score of 71.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13697)|
| 3:48:25| So you all used a set criterion to develop that number, to get to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13705)|
| 3:48:32| And then in the last meeting you gave them 64% of their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13712)|
| 3:48:39| And so I'm trying to understand the basis for giving that percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13719)|
| 3:48:44| Was it just a gut feeling that each person had and you divided those numbers by ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13724)|
| 3:48:49| or what was the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13729)|
| 3:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13732)|
| 3:48:53| I have to speak for myself, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13733)|
| 3:48:56| because I really don't know about the other nine members how they arrived at their percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13736)|
| 3:48:59| although we were all relatively close to one another when it came to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13739)|
| 3:49:04| The percentage, I would pick out a number kind of based on what I had done with the scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13744)|
| 3:49:12| If I thought you really, really had a good application, a good interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13752)|
| 3:49:17| I probably scored you pretty high on percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| Maybe even 100% could have been 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| And you can tell by the V-Power, their scores were in the low 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13764)|
| 3:49:31| So they obviously didn't get real high scores on the narrative in the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13771)|
| 3:49:37| But in something like that, I might say, well, I'll give them 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| But that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| And that really was a low score and a low number, but they still got money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13784)|
| 3:49:50| They still got money because we still had money to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13790)|
| 3:49:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| But I guess, and maybe it's the scientists in me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13794)|
| 3:49:59| is that you guys had a basis to come up with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13799)|
| 3:50:03| And I guess I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13803)|
| 3:50:07| Being honest, I do have problems with kind of coming up with a feel-good kind of number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13807)|
| 3:50:14| for lack of a better word or way of putting it, to come up with the final dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13814)|
| 3:50:19| So I just want to kind of put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| I know we've heard a lot of grief for us wanting to dig back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13821)|
| 3:50:26| And then also to kind of piggyback on what Commissioner Pinkston said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13826)|
| 3:50:30| we have to look at this thing in a total way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13830)|
| 3:50:34| I mean, we have to look at the full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13834)|
| 3:50:36| And you all may have felt real strong about social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| but if that meant money away from this tourism piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13840)|
| 3:50:43| I would hope that the public understands that, hey, this tourism piece, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13843)|
| 3:50:49| really might end up being a better program for the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13849)|
| 3:50:55| So that's all I've got to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13858)|
| 3:51:00| I just want to make a comment and reiterate this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13860)|
| 3:51:04| Doc, did you volunteer or were you appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13864)|
| 3:51:08| Did a commissioner appoint you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13868)|
| 3:51:10| Or did you volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13870)|
| 3:51:11| I volunteered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13871)|
| 3:51:12| You know, commissioners, we, at least I nominated five or six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13872)|
| 3:51:16| They never one got on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13876)|
| 3:51:18| And, you know, I felt like I nominated some very sharp individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13878)|
| 3:51:22| And the panels that I did attend, there were some very sharp individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13882)|
| 3:51:26| So I don't want to be too critical of the group because, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13886)|
| 3:51:29| we're the ones appointing these people, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13889)|
| 3:51:32| We didn't appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13892)|
| 3:51:33| You were given notice to make appointments several times from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13893)|
| 3:51:40| I took advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13900)|
| 3:51:41| I threw some names out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| And then it was you volunteered yourself, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13905)|
| 3:51:48| And it was in the newspaper, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13908)|
| 3:51:49| If you wanted to volunteer, you can volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| And that's what these people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13914)|
| 3:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13915)|
| 3:51:56| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13916)|
| 3:51:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13918)|
| 3:51:59| Anyone that wanted to be on the panel was put on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| As long as they didn't have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13922)|
| 3:52:03| No, they didn't have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13923)|
| 3:52:06| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13926)|
| 3:52:07| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| I had the privilege of getting to speak to Donna and Jim and Antonio all at various times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13929)|
| 3:52:16| once with Donna on the Hubert Smith Show on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13936)|
| 3:52:21| We need to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| We've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| Let's get our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13945)|
| 3:52:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13948)|
| 3:52:30| I was on the Hubert Show, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| There was a point to that, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13952)|
| 3:52:34| Let's ask the questions so we can get answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13954)|
| 3:52:38| First of all, I think it's tough for the government to try to fund nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13958)|
| 3:52:44| I think that when nonprofits raise their own money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13964)|
| 3:52:47| then it shows that the community supports that nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13967)|
| 3:52:51| Based on that and based on the process as you went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13971)|
| 3:52:55| if you had the opportunity, what would you change about the process for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13975)|
| 3:53:01| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13981)|
| 3:53:02| Boy, you put me on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13982)|
| 3:53:07| I guess one thing I already recommended, and hopefully it will happen, would be smaller panels, fewer panelists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13987)|
| 3:53:16| The salary information that I was reading you, maybe I could have accessed that sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=13996)|
| 3:53:24| but I just found that information last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14004)|
| 3:53:28| That would help me because, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| when I see someone who's making what I consider very high salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14010)|
| 3:53:35| and they're supposed to be in a charitable organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14015)|
| 3:53:38| that would, I think, influence me on my scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14018)|
| 3:53:44| Really, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14024)|
| 3:53:47| I think our process was pretty good for the first time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14027)|
| 3:53:51| and I'm sure that community development has got some other great ideas to try and make it better next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14031)|
| 3:53:57| I do know, in talking with some of other committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14037)|
| 3:54:02| that if commission elects to change all of this around, it may be hard to find volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14042)|
| 3:54:12| I know I will not serve again because I spent a lot of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14052)|
| 3:54:17| Thank you, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| Let's keep our questions on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| There's nothing on you, Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| I kind of let it get out of hand before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14063)|
| 3:54:27| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| I'll make this very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| Donna, this is still for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| Again, we're going to keep you on the hot seat real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14072)|
| 3:54:34| I did get an e-mail and a very long letter from one of the panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14074)|
| 3:54:38| and their concern was that it seemed to be weighted a little bit more toward the bigger organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14078)|
| 3:54:43| as to the smaller organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| And I thought it was interesting what you said about you put a lot of weight on the written application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14085)|
| 3:54:50| you put a lot of weight on the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14090)|
| 3:54:53| And sometimes, and I'm not picking on the American Red Cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14093)|
| 3:54:56| I'm just picking on a well-known one, is that they have professional grant writers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| they have professional people that present these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14100)|
| 3:55:03| and it seems that they're going to make a better impression than someone that comes in, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14103)|
| 3:55:09| like Dr. Kim, who filled it out for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14109)|
| 3:55:12| You know, there may be some language issues when he presented his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14112)|
| 3:55:14| We saw some others from these smaller groups in the churches who are not professional people at presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14114)|
| 3:55:19| and trying to sell an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14119)|
| 3:55:22| And do you think that the criticism that I heard from a panelist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14122)|
| 3:55:25| that it was maybe weighted a little bit more toward the bigger professional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14125)|
| 3:55:29| might have had an impact and an influence on the panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14129)|
| 3:55:32| that we might have to consider next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14132)|
| 3:55:35| I'll speak again personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14135)|
| 3:55:37| It influenced me and my scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14137)|
| 3:55:41| And I think justifiably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14141)|
| 3:55:44| This is our tax money that's being given out to the organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14144)|
| 3:55:50| and I would prefer to see the money go to organizations who really know their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14150)|
| 3:55:57| Yes, there were organizations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| They're just small operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14159)|
| 3:56:02| Their narrative was pretty poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| They were scored very low and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| They still do good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14167)|
| 3:56:08| Don't misunderstand me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| But we have few dollars, and I would prefer that they go to someplace that's really going to utilize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14170)|
| 3:56:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14178)|
| 3:56:19| Commissioner DeFriese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14181)|
| 3:56:22| Donna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14182)|
| 3:56:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14183)|
| 3:56:24| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14184)|
| 3:56:25| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14185)|
| 3:56:26| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14186)|
| 3:56:27| One was, was the salary information of the top paid employees not included in your review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14187)|
| 3:56:35| In the budget form that we had, there were salaries indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14195)|
| 3:56:43| It was usually for like maybe just that person who oversaw that particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14203)|
| 3:56:48| I didn't see some of these big numbers like I came across last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14208)|
| 3:56:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14212)|
| 3:56:53| So that was not in your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14215)|
| 3:56:56| I mean, we did have some salary information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14216)|
| 3:56:58| but, again, it was primarily for someone who was going to oversee this specific program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14218)|
| 3:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14223)|
| 3:57:04| And another question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14224)|
| 3:57:06| When you did the assessment to determine what percentage you would designate to these grant applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14226)|
| 3:57:17| were you given 100% total to designate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14237)|
| 3:57:22| So you could only designate 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14242)|
| 3:57:25| Or could you have gone through and given every single one 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14245)|
| 3:57:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14249)|
| 3:57:32| When I personally looked at 41 applications on the last sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14252)|
| 3:57:38| I was asked to put down the percentage that I would recommend this grant be funded for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14258)|
| 3:57:46| But I'm saying, okay, I understand that, but there's only 100% of the monies available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14266)|
| 3:57:51| So did you work within 100% and say, okay, if I was given 100% of the dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14271)|
| 3:57:58| I would put, you know, 20% here, 30% here, because that would be 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14278)|
| 3:58:04| Then you only have 50% left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14284)|
| 3:58:06| I mean, you didn't operate that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14286)|
| 3:58:10| Well, I didn't have any dollar number to work with when I was doing my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14290)|
| 3:58:15| But I'm just saying percent of the monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| I guess my question would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14297)|
| 3:58:20| You know, you see how all of us put in our percentage to arrive at the average funding percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14300)|
| 3:58:27| You do understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14307)|
| 3:58:28| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14308)|
| 3:58:29| But I'm saying the percentages that you designated in this column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14309)|
| 3:58:35| would the percentages that you personally designated, would they have totaled more than 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14315)|
| 3:58:42| Well, not for that particular applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| I mean, the most I could designate to one applicant was 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| Okay, but I'm just saying that it would seem confusing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14327)|
| 3:58:51| that if you could designate 100% to every applicant...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14331)|
| 3:58:55| Well, and if you look at cerebral palsy housing, as an example, under social funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14335)|
| 3:59:01| supported living, you see that they have average funding percentage of 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14341)|
| 3:59:05| So does that mean everybody gave them 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14345)|
| 3:59:07| Every panelist allocated 100% of the amount requested on their application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14347)|
| 3:59:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14355)|
| 3:59:16| Okay, every panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14356)|
| 3:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14358)|
| 3:59:20| There are no other likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14360)|
| 3:59:21| Thank you, Ms. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14361)|
| 3:59:27| Jim Burge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14367)|

| 3:59:36| Jim Burge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14376)|
| 3:59:41| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14381)|
| 3:59:43| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14383)|
| 3:59:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14384)|
| 3:59:45| Antonio Hinton, 702 Luttrell Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14385)|
| 3:59:50| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14392)|
| 3:59:54| I'm kind of glad you asked, Ms. McEvers, all those technical questions, to be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14394)|
| 3:59:59| because that's not what I'm here to really talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14399)|
| 4:00:02| I served on the tourism and culture panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14402)|
| 4:00:06| And the main point, the reason why I'm here is, call it gossip, call it rumor, call it what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14406)|
| 4:00:17| some people who served on these panels and some of the general public feel like that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14417)|
| 4:00:23| the commissioners, are not going to take into consideration or any consideration as to what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14423)|
| 4:00:30| you know, each of these people who had served on the panels' recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14430)|
| 4:00:35| I, for one, believe that that is certainly your right as elected officials, that that is not the issue I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14435)|
| 4:00:42| You have the right to fund more, fund less, do whatever you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14442)|
| 4:00:47| My only issue would be is that there are some people believe that the reason why this was created was in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14447)|
| 4:00:55| because of mishandling by county government to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14455)|
| 4:01:03| And so some people feel like we answered the call of our government to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14463)|
| 4:01:09| And again, some people believe to help clean up or, well, clean up a mess that was in part created by the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14469)|
| 4:01:19| That's not my personal feeling, but be that as it may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14479)|
| 4:01:24| Again, the issue I have is not necessarily how you decide to fund or not fund a particular panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14484)|
| 4:01:33| I would just say that I sincerely hope that you take into consideration the recommendations that we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14493)|
| 4:01:38| because of the time and effort that we put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14498)|
| 4:01:41| And again, because these, you know, myself and others took the time and the initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14501)|
| 4:01:48| to want to help a lot of these nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14508)|
| 4:01:52| And that would be my main point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14512)|
| 4:01:57| How you decide to fund them, you are the elected leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14517)|
| 4:02:01| I presume you know what you are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| And I have every faith and confidence in each and every one of you that you will make what you feel like is the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14525)|
| 4:02:13| Again, you know, just one more time, I would just ask that whatever we, the panel, for those of us who served on the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14533)|
| 4:02:20| that you take our recommendations into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14540)|
| 4:02:24| Now, you know, looking at some of the panels, there are some that I personally would not want to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14544)|
| 4:02:32| I don't think it's government's business to fund some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14552)|
| 4:02:35| But again, you guys and ladies are the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14555)|
| 4:02:39| And again, I just ask that being how we spent time and effort, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14559)|
| 4:02:45| answering the call from someone within the government to help with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14565)|
| 4:02:50| which I was glad to do and I'd be glad to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14570)|
| 4:02:53| And I actually look forward to doing it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| I mean, you know, this was a pilot program, so there were obviously going to be mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14575)|
| 4:02:59| And I think we're letting that kind of overshadow what this was really, really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14579)|
| 4:03:08| Again, this is the first time that something like this has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14588)|
| 4:03:11| And quite frankly, I think citizens should have a say in what's being done with their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14591)|
| 4:03:17| Because remember one thing, it's not your money, it's our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14597)|
| 4:03:20| And again, you know, I expected there to be some mishaps, some missteps, even mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14600)|
| 4:03:28| But I don't think that they were so grave that, again, whatever it is that we decided to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14608)|
| 4:03:35| could not be taken into full consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14615)|
| 4:03:38| And that's really all I would ask of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14618)|
| 4:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14621)|
| 4:03:42| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14622)|
| 4:03:44| Yeah, Antonio, I really appreciate the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14624)|
| 4:03:47| And Donna, I appreciate the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| And everyone who served on these committees, I really appreciate the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14629)|
| 4:03:56| And I know there's a lot of misconception out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14636)|
| 4:03:59| You know, I know that I've seen the blogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14639)|
| 4:04:02| You know, people are saying commission is going to just throw these recommendations out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14642)|
| 4:04:08| I can only speak for myself, but that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14648)|
| 4:04:12| I am going to strongly take these recommendations into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14652)|
| 4:04:19| There's other folks on the blogs that are saying that commission should pass exactly what you guys passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14659)|
| 4:04:28| And I don't intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| I do intend to tweak some of these a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14670)|
| 4:04:35| It's a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14675)|
| 4:04:38| You guys were the advisory committee, and you guys are a very, very valuable part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14678)|
| 4:04:44| And every bit of work you did, we were going to have to do if you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14684)|
| 4:04:49| And I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| But if a commissioner wants to tweak something here, wants to tweak something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14691)|
| 4:04:57| I don't want you guys to feel insulted because it's just a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14697)|
| 4:05:02| You did the groundwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14702)|
| 4:05:04| And then if we make some final modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14704)|
| 4:05:07| I don't want you guys to feel like we're throwing your work out the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14707)|
| 4:05:11| because we're building on the work you did and not throwing it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14711)|
| 4:05:14| And, again, I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14714)|
| 4:05:16| Let me just make one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14716)|
| 4:05:17| Again, I think all of the panelists knew, at least we were all informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14717)|
| 4:05:21| certainly the panel that I served on, that, again, you as commissioners had the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14721)|
| 4:05:27| or the ability to make whatever changes, i.e. in funding, that you wanted to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14727)|
| 4:05:33| So I think we all knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14733)|
| 4:05:35| Again, I certainly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| But, again, hearing and receiving correspondence that the entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14737)|
| 4:05:45| our entire recommendations were just going to be tossed to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14745)|
| 4:05:52| that is what kind of concerned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14752)|
| 4:05:55| I knew from day one that there were things that you could tweak, fund more, fund less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14755)|
| 4:06:01| Again, that is not my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14761)|
| 4:06:05| Again, you are the elected leaders of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14765)|
| 4:06:08| and unfortunately you have to do things like that sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| And, again, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14771)|
| 4:06:14| Again, my main concern was just not taking any of our advisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14774)|
| 4:06:21| or consideration at hand, and so that would be my main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| But just to kind of put a period at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14789)|
| 4:06:31| you don't have a problem as a person who served all those hours on a panel with this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14791)|
| 4:06:38| looking at and changing some of those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14798)|
| 4:06:41| as long as we truly value that it's not us going in and reinventing the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14801)|
| 4:06:47| Well, again, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14807)|
| 4:06:49| I do think citizens ought to have some say what's being done with their tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14809)|
| 4:06:53| again, because this is taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14813)|
| 4:06:56| And what I would say is that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14816)|
| 4:07:03| I understand that you have to do it according to how you see fit as an elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14823)|
| 4:07:11| because it's we the people who put you there, i.e. through elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14831)|
| 4:07:16| So, again, in other words, just to give you an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14836)|
| 4:07:24| there was some here that decided to get no funding whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14844)|
| 4:07:29| and I believe it's the County Commission's intention not to fund it at all, probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14849)|
| 4:07:37| based on the fact that it received very, very low scores based on our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14857)|
| 4:07:44| Now, if you decided to fund it, just as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14864)|
| 4:07:47| the East Tennessee Television and Film Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14867)|
| 4:07:50| it received a fairly low score, in fact, a very low score relatively compared to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14870)|
| 4:07:58| There was no funding for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14878)|
| 4:08:01| Now, if you decided to turn around and fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| I would be okay with that just as, you know, the Keep Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14883)|
| 4:08:08| that was one of our highest, at least for my panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14888)|
| 4:08:11| the panel that I served on, that received one of the higher scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14891)|
| 4:08:15| Now, if you decided to turn around and not fund any of that at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14895)|
| 4:08:20| I certainly wouldn't agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14900)|
| 4:08:24| but that is something that I knew could possibly happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14904)|
| 4:08:29| And, again, that decision falls on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14909)|
| 4:08:34| But, again, if you decide to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14914)|
| 4:08:37| we are going to change everything, fund everything, or fund it and nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14917)|
| 4:08:41| or, you know, whatever that decision might have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14921)|
| 4:08:44| again, that was my only issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14924)|
| 4:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14928)|
| 4:08:49| Mission number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14929)|
| 4:08:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14930)|
| 4:08:51| Tony, thank you for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| I just want to say a comment that, not to you, but to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14933)|
| 4:09:00| that, you know, we hear these things like we're not going to take the citizens panel recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14940)|
| 4:09:06| and it's kind of citizens versus county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14946)|
| 4:09:09| You know, we should all be working on the same side to spend this money as wisely as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14949)|
| 4:09:13| to help as many people as we can to make our community a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14953)|
| 4:09:17| So, hopefully, that's what we're all doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| We're all on the same side instead of citizens versus county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| Well, if you come up against the citizens, you'll definitely lose because we elect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14963)|
| 4:09:27| So I would always say for the county commission, never try and take on the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14967)|
| 4:09:31| But let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14971)|
| 4:09:34| You know, I have my own personal beliefs about some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14974)|
| 4:09:37| Personally, I don't believe that government should be funding some of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14977)|
| 4:09:41| and it's not just, you know, mine in particular, the panel that I served on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| but I think that, you know, there should be no tax dollars going towards some so-called non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14984)|
| 4:09:50| because, quite frankly, they're not really non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| As Ms. McGevers pointed out, you know, you have some directors making six-figure salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14992)|
| 4:09:57| To me, that's not really non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=14997)|
| 4:10:00| But, you know, again, that decision falls on the people and the folks elect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15000)|
| 4:10:05| And, you know, again, that's just my personal belief and feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15005)|
| 4:10:10| But, again, I trust that you all make the right decisions based on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15010)|
| 4:10:16| thoroughly investigating and looking at, you know, whatever it is that you guys decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15016)|
| 4:10:23| Thank you, Mr. Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15023)|

| 4:10:33| Daniel Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15033)|
| 4:10:42| My name is Daniel Smith, 7108 Lawford Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15042)|
| 4:10:49| I appreciate the opportunity to get on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15049)|
| 4:10:53| And I was on the social services panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15053)|
| 4:10:58| and since there have been some questions that have been asked of the previous public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15058)|
| 4:11:05| I made a couple of responses that may clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15065)|
| 4:11:09| but then I wanted to tell you what I was going to say in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| With regard to the scoring and the amount of money that was allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15072)|
| 4:11:20| we were asked at the bottom of the last page of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15080)|
| 4:11:25| what percentage would you give this organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15085)|
| 4:11:28| However, with regard to the way it fell, it was all objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15088)|
| 4:11:34| Now, I can't remember, and you'll have to ask Mr. Hoagland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15094)|
| 4:11:41| but this whole thing was set up on a matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15101)|
| 4:11:44| and they used Excel, and they did way better with Excel than I can ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15104)|
| 4:11:49| I have trouble getting two columns to add up right, even if you just say some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15109)|
| 4:11:55| But the department used a sheet that took the information and spread it and set it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15115)|
| 4:12:04| and there was nothing with regard to the allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15124)|
| 4:12:09| and with regard to the scoring that was subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15129)|
| 4:12:16| It was about as objective as it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15136)|
| 4:12:20| I'm killing my time here, but I wanted to respond to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15140)|
| 4:12:26| We showed up. I answered an ad in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15146)|
| 4:12:30| I wish I had that kind of luck in trying to get a real job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15150)|
| 4:12:34| but I answered an ad in the paper and sent in an application and got chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15154)|
| 4:12:41| We all showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15161)|
| 4:12:42| We went down on Harriet Tubman, and the law was explained to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15162)|
| 4:12:49| Mike Armour spoke to us. The mayor spoke to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15169)|
| 4:12:52| Several of the people who were in the room asked the question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15172)|
| 4:12:57| now, are we just going to be spinning our wheels, and is this just so-and-so and so-and-so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15177)|
| 4:13:02| But anyway, we were assured by the mayor that the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15182)|
| 4:13:06| whatever the panels recommended, would be sent to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15186)|
| 4:13:09| and the county commission has the right by law to make the allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15189)|
| 4:13:13| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| Then we had another meeting, and we were assigned to panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15195)|
| 4:13:18| We didn't get to pick the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| And then we were given a book, and you've seen the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15201)|
| 4:13:24| They had blank apps in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15204)|
| 4:13:27| I mean, they had blank score sheets in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15207)|
| 4:13:30| And we took those home, and we spent whatever amount of time each of us spent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15210)|
| 4:13:35| And then we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15215)|
| 4:13:36| We were told, if anybody calls you, your name's going to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15216)|
| 4:13:41| You are not to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| I don't envy you, ladies and gentlemen, because you don't have that luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15223)|
| 4:13:48| You return phone calls, and if you don't, you get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| But I hope I made that part clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15233)|
| 4:13:56| I just wanted to give you a little insight in terms of how we looked at some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15236)|
| 4:14:01| And we looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15241)|
| 4:14:02| Commissioner Smith asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15242)|
| 4:14:05| We looked at it at bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15245)|
| 4:14:08| I'm not a big proponent of public funding going to faith-based organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15248)|
| 4:14:15| However, when one of the ministries came in and said they wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15255)|
| 4:14:19| I don't remember the numbers, $15,000, whatever it was, for feeding people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15259)|
| 4:14:24| And they can feed a person for $1.79 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15264)|
| 4:14:30| And they can account for it on a line, on an audited statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15270)|
| 4:14:36| That's a lot of bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15276)|
| 4:14:39| On the other hand, speaking of another one, when Lost Sheep Ministries comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15279)|
| 4:14:43| and again, I'm not meaning to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15283)|
| 4:14:47| and they ask for two pieces of kitchen equipment that cost $30,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15287)|
| 4:14:52| and they show a catalog sheet, and it's brand new equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15292)|
| 4:14:56| it goes through your mind as to have they shopped the used equipment market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15296)|
| 4:15:00| Or are there other non-profits out there who may have unused kitchen equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15300)|
| 4:15:05| similar to what they want, that they could just be given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15305)|
| 4:15:09| And so it's that kind of thought process that went into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15309)|
| 4:15:13| in terms of what kind of leverage that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15313)|
| 4:15:21| There were a couple of things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15321)|
| 4:15:24| I have a conflict of interest on a broad base because I'm a senior citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15324)|
| 4:15:30| I'm a veteran, and I go to the symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15330)|
| 4:15:34| However, I'm not on any of those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15334)|
| 4:15:37| But Commissioner Pinkston asked the question about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15337)|
| 4:15:40| what would you do with the other panels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15340)|
| 4:15:42| We can't answer that question because we weren't on those panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15342)|
| 4:15:45| You know, on a personal basis, we had funding for shut-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15345)|
| 4:15:53| Oh, I don't call them shut-ins anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| I forgot what they're called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15355)|
| 4:15:56| But anyway, see, that shows I'm a senior citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15356)|
| 4:16:02| I forgot what the new name for shut-ins is, and I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15362)|
| 4:16:07| But, you know, to fund a very small amount of money to put used computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15367)|
| 4:16:13| in the homes of people who couldn't get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15373)|
| 4:16:16| so that they could communicate by the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15376)|
| 4:16:19| It didn't get a high score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15379)|
| 4:16:21| You know, personally, I wish I'd had the money to write a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15381)|
| 4:16:25| and take care of it because it was really funding stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15385)|
| 4:16:28| and everything else was going to be handled by volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15388)|
| 4:16:32| With regard to Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15392)|
| 4:16:34| Mr. Smith, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15394)|
| 4:16:36| Yes, I knew this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15396)|
| 4:16:38| But anyway, with regard to Dr. Kim, if I had been on that panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15398)|
| 4:16:42| you know, I can't tell you how it would have come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15402)|
| 4:16:47| We only looked at what we had, and it was truly objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15407)|
| 4:16:52| And I just wanted to give you a little bit of insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15412)|
| 4:16:55| into how we looked at it in terms of bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15415)|
| 4:16:59| And I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15419)|
| 4:17:02| and I appreciate the opportunity to be able to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15422)|
| 4:17:08| And I really do think that after listening to the questions today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15428)|
| 4:17:14| and hearing the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15434)|
| 4:17:16| I really do think that you will look at what the panelists had put down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15436)|
| 4:17:23| because you personally, I think, don't want to take that kind of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15443)|
| 4:17:30| 50 hours per person, and go through it and do it all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15450)|
| 4:17:35| But if you want to, you are our elected officials, and that's your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15455)|
| 4:17:39| That's it, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15461)|
| 4:17:42| We have some questions, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15464)|
| 4:17:46| Yes, so then which panel were you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| Social Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15470)|
| 4:17:51| Okay, so what you're saying is there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15471)|
| 4:17:55| It was not subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| So that last meeting, you based your percentages off a set criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15477)|
| 4:18:02| Could you let me know what that set criterion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15482)|
| 4:18:05| It was all based on the score sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15485)|
| 4:18:08| It couldn't have been because the score sheet has numbers that don't correlate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15488)|
| 4:18:14| with the percentage oftentimes, most times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15494)|
| 4:18:18| that doesn't correlate with the percentage that was funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15498)|
| 4:18:22| Maybe that's what you did in your process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15502)|
| 4:18:25| but it couldn't have been across all ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15505)|
| 4:18:28| or the numbers would have paralleled the score sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15508)|
| 4:18:34| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15514)|
| 4:18:36| I think I understand, but you're a nuclear physicist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15516)|
| 4:18:39| And I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15519)|
| 4:18:42| The one thing I can tell you, and I cannot remember the setup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15522)|
| 4:18:51| all I can tell you is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15531)|
| 4:18:53| is that every time we made a number based on the score sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15533)|
| 4:19:00| and we made it two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15540)|
| 4:19:03| One was after we had reviewed the score sheets ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15543)|
| 4:19:09| and then we had to disclose what our scores were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15549)|
| 4:19:12| That was put into a matrix on an Excel sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15552)|
| 4:19:18| and it just ranked everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15558)|
| 4:19:20| And then we gave each applicant the opportunity to come and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15560)|
| 4:19:26| and answer questions and make comments if they wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15566)|
| 4:19:30| And then we reviewed the score sheets again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15570)|
| 4:19:33| and in some cases there were changes made on the score sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15573)|
| 4:19:38| And then those two numbers were averaged together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15578)|
| 4:19:41| and that completed the ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15581)|
| 4:19:44| And so then when the amount of money was put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15584)|
| 4:19:48| on the basis of the scoring, it just fell into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15588)|
| 4:19:53| Now the technical aspect of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15593)|
| 4:19:56| you'll have to speak with Mr. Hoagland about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15596)|
| 4:19:59| because like I said, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15599)|
| 4:20:04| Well, just like on the cerebral palsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15604)|
| 4:20:06| it has a final score of 77.05,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15606)|
| 4:20:13| but it got 95% of the asked for amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15613)|
| 4:20:19| So I guess I'm just really having trouble figuring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15619)|
| 4:20:24| So maybe that's probably a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15624)|
| 4:20:26| I apologize, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15626)|
| 4:20:27| That's probably a question for Eric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15627)|
| 4:20:29| so hopefully someone in the mayor's staff will help out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15629)|
| 4:20:33| and get myself an answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15633)|
| 4:20:36| I would suggest that you do ask the department to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15636)|
| 4:20:43| and show you how that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| because they took great pains to make sure that there was a consistent plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15645)|
| 4:20:51| and that everything was based on the scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15651)|
| 4:20:58| If I had had my way with regard to the Kansler Y,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15658)|
| 4:21:04| I wouldn't have wanted to see that on an arbitrary panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15664)|
| 4:21:10| I would have wanted to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15670)|
| 4:21:12| because they anticipated a guarantee from the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15672)|
| 4:21:16| for X amount of funding for X years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15676)|
| 4:21:20| and somehow or other it got on our panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15680)|
| 4:21:24| But I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| That was a non-responsive question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15687)|
| 4:21:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15691)|
| 4:21:34| Did I understand you to say that someone told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15694)|
| 4:21:39| that you couldn't accept phone calls from citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15699)|
| 4:21:43| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15703)|
| 4:21:45| What we were told is that we were not to discuss these things outside of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15705)|
| 4:21:56| and that it would be improper for us to be lobbied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15716)|
| 4:22:01| Was it made clear that you couldn't speak to each other outside the meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15721)|
| 4:22:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15727)|
| 4:22:09| But you know there's a difference when you're sitting on a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15729)|
| 4:22:13| like when I'm sitting here on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15733)|
| 4:22:16| There's a difference in me discussing business with a member of the same board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15736)|
| 4:22:22| and a citizen discussing business with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15742)|
| 4:22:26| I mean, a citizen has a right to speak to you if you're on a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15746)|
| 4:22:31| and anybody who told you that they didn't doesn't understand the First Amendment very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15751)|
| 4:22:36| As long as you're not serving on the same board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15756)|
| 4:22:40| the Sunshine Law does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15760)|
| 4:22:42| It does not apply to citizens speaking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15762)|
| 4:22:45| It applies to us speaking to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15765)|
| 4:22:47| So you had a right to discuss this with your family, with your friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15767)|
| 4:22:52| You just couldn't discuss it with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15772)|
| 4:22:55| Did someone lead you to believe otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15775)|
| 4:22:57| Well, it was made clear to us, and I perhaps was too general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15777)|
| 4:23:04| It was made clear to us that it was improper for us to be lobbied by the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15784)|
| 4:23:13| Well, whether it was your committee's procedure or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15793)|
| 4:23:20| it was not illegal for you to accept phone calls from folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15800)|
| 4:23:24| Nobody called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15804)|
| 4:23:25| And it's not illegal for you to be lobbied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15805)|
| 4:23:27| And I want citizens to know I may not be able to discuss county business with my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15807)|
| 4:23:33| but I want citizens to call me any time they want to to discuss things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15813)|
| 4:23:39| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15819)|
| 4:23:41| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| Yes, I just wanted to make sure that, and I appreciate your service, Mr. Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15823)|
| 4:23:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15827)|
| 4:23:48| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15828)|
| 4:23:49| Yes, I was talking to Mr. Hinton and to you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15829)|
| 4:23:52| He's sitting right there behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15832)|
| 4:23:53| And thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15833)|
| 4:23:55| No, you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| But what I wanted to make sure that everyone understood is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15837)|
| 4:24:00| while you did serve on your respective panel, we have to look at these in the totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15840)|
| 4:24:06| And so while you had to make a decision just in your little piece, we have to put all those pieces together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15846)|
| 4:24:13| And just as we had a lady this morning in tears talking about her mother at the Howard Circle of Friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15853)|
| 4:24:19| you know, that carried a lot of weight with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15859)|
| 4:24:23| And we had the Rossini Festival that basically they asked for $10,000 and received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15863)|
| 4:24:30| or last year they were awarded $10,000 and this year received $71,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15870)|
| 4:24:35| And Howard Circle of Friends got none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15875)|
| 4:24:38| And so we are lobbied by a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15878)|
| 4:24:42| And you have to understand that we have to listen to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15882)|
| 4:24:45| And we have to weight all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15885)|
| 4:24:48| And we appreciate your service, and we appreciate the legwork that you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15888)|
| 4:24:53| You did an excellent job for a first time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15893)|
| 4:24:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15896)|
| 4:24:58| You're welcome, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15898)|
| 4:24:59| And I'm not disagreeing with anything you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15899)|
| 4:25:03| You've got to look at all 100 and something or other applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15903)|
| 4:25:07| and there is no way that everybody is going to be satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15907)|
| 4:25:12| because there's only X amount of money to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15912)|
| 4:25:17| And I agree with Commissioner Pinkson that we didn't see everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15917)|
| 4:25:25| And I don't know what I would have done had I been on the panel for Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15925)|
| 4:25:30| I don't know what I would do without Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15930)|
| 4:25:34| And some people don't have it, but that wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15934)|
| 4:25:40| Seeing no other questions, thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15940)|
| 4:25:43| And I just wanted to say to Commissioner Lambert that while it was made clear with regard to the Sunshine Lawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15943)|
| 4:25:50| and everything, I didn't get any calls from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15950)|
| 4:25:54| So I guess I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15954)|
| 4:26:03| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15963)|
| 4:26:07| Yes, Mr. Hinton wanted to address Commissioner Lambert's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15967)|
| 4:26:12| I just wanted to make one quick point to your question in regards to what we were allowed to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15972)|
| 4:26:20| It was my understanding, at least in the panel that I was in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15980)|
| 4:26:24| that we were kind of bound to the same open meetings law as you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15984)|
| 4:26:31| because we were in part, in fact, an extension of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15991)|
| 4:26:36| In other words, we could not speak to each other outside of the actual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=15996)|
| 4:26:48| Pretty much the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16008)|
| 4:26:50| In other words, you could not speak with a fellow commissioner outside of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16010)|
| 4:26:54| Now, they did say that we could actually speak to, and again, this is just the panel that I sat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16014)|
| 4:26:59| I don't know how others did it, but I'm assuming they did it the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16019)|
| 4:27:02| But it was my understanding that we actually could speak to whatever organization was asking for some grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16022)|
| 4:27:12| In fact, a few of us actually said if a couple of us wish to go there and ask some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16032)|
| 4:27:19| to see how they function in operation because some of that stuff was not on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16039)|
| 4:27:24| We wanted to know what is their day-to-day operations and funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16044)|
| 4:27:28| or operations and whatever it is that they did, in other words, to justify the funding that they were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16048)|
| 4:27:36| So just to speak to that point, they said we were kind of an extension of county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16056)|
| 4:27:41| and the same sunshine rules and laws applied, i.e., do not speak about it with a fellow panel member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16061)|
| 4:27:48| outside of the actual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16068)|
| 4:27:53| Yeah, and that's the way it should have been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16073)|
| 4:27:57| This was the second time Tamara Shepard, a citizen that lives in my district that served on one of these panels in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16077)|
| 4:28:08| had said a similar concern that they had said that they were limited on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16088)|
| 4:28:14| Basically, she said they told her that she couldn't call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16094)|
| 4:28:18| And I said, well, we don't serve on the same board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16098)|
| 4:28:22| And I had forgotten about it until he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16102)|
| 4:28:24| So apparently, at one of the panels at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16104)|
| 4:28:27| it wasn't made very clear that the sunshine law applies to you guys talking to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16107)|
| 4:28:33| not you guys talking to citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| And next year I'll see that they make that very clear because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16115)|
| 4:28:39| you've got a right to ask your friends and family their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16119)|
| 4:28:43| I ask my friends and family their opinion all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16123)|
| 4:28:46| I just can't ask Larry his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16126)|
| 4:28:49| Well, again, it was my understanding that we actually could ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| but, I mean, I guess I don't know if they consider that lobbying or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16131)|
| 4:28:55| but that was my understanding, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16135)|
| 4:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16138)|
| 4:29:00| Beth Talley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16140)|
| 4:29:12| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16152)|
| 4:29:14| My name is Beth Talley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16154)|
| 4:29:15| I live at 247 Dietrich Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16155)|
| 4:29:20| And I'm not here to talk about the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16160)|
| 4:29:24| I'm here to talk about just articles that I've been reading about the library and just possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16164)|
| 4:29:33| well, I know that the director has asked for 14.9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16173)|
| 4:29:37| and the mayor has, I think, given you guys a proposal of 12.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16177)|
| 4:29:44| There are two small branches that would be affected dearly if you cut into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16184)|
| 4:29:52| and one of them is mine, which is why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16192)|
| 4:29:54| It's the Murphy Branch, and it's very dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16194)|
| 4:29:59| This is a branch that is small and tiny, and it should be much larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16199)|
| 4:30:03| especially for the community which it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16203)|
| 4:30:07| The community is very impoverished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16207)|
| 4:30:09| In fact, a lot of the schools, and the closest school is 90% on free lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16209)|
| 4:30:19| This is a community that doesn't have a lot of resources, and this is an asset to their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16219)|
| 4:30:27| And I'm just hoping and praying that you guys see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16227)|
| 4:30:32| and see the assets that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16232)|
| 4:30:35| And instead of asking the director, you know, how little can you get by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16235)|
| 4:30:42| asking the director a different question, what exactly do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16242)|
| 4:30:48| I know he's asked for 14.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16248)|
| 4:30:52| I would hope that y'all would give him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16252)|
| 4:30:56| This is Knox County, and I think I've grown up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16256)|
| 4:30:59| and I guess I expect excellence out of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16259)|
| 4:31:04| And especially within the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16264)|
| 4:31:07| The communities here, some especially, revolve around the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16267)|
| 4:31:13| So anyway, I just would like for you to just reconsider what you give to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16273)|
| 4:31:23| I know there's other things that I wanted to say, but I always tend to forget things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16283)|
| 4:31:30| I'm not the great orator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16290)|
| 4:31:33| But it is an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16293)|
| 4:31:36| And next year, every summer, our library branch warriors that it's going to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16296)|
| 4:31:41| And I just want next year to have faith in my commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16301)|
| 4:31:46| that they're not going to have to worry about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16306)|
| 4:31:48| that they're going to understand the importance of the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16308)|
| 4:31:53| And next year, the budget will be given to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16313)|
| 4:31:57| So there won't be services cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16317)|
| 4:31:59| There won't be branches cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16319)|
| 4:32:02| And that's all I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16322)|
| 4:32:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16323)|
| 4:32:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16324)|
| 4:32:06| I appreciate very much what you said and your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16326)|
| 4:32:09| And I think there's been some rumors going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| Really, the fact of the matter is that there's a $400,000 increase in the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16332)|
| 4:32:18| There really has been no cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16338)|
| 4:32:19| It's actually been an increase over the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16339)|
| 4:32:22| And I think that rumor got started about library branches closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16342)|
| 4:32:26| is that this fellow that's sitting next to me here just asked the question one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16346)|
| 4:32:29| what are the most used, the two least used libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16349)|
| 4:32:32| And it was Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16352)|
| 4:32:33| And Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16353)|
| 4:32:34| And yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16354)|
| 4:32:35| And I really don't think that anyone's come forward and said they're going to close branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16355)|
| 4:32:40| No, these were articles that were written on WBIR and the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16360)|
| 4:32:46| Just the director knowing it's a bare-bones budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16366)|
| 4:32:49| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16369)|
| 4:32:50| But I think it originated from here where we just asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16370)|
| 4:32:52| what's the two busiest and what's the two least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16372)|
| 4:32:55| But the point being is that even with this tight budget year, you know, where everyone's being cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16375)|
| 4:32:59| the library got an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| And these commissioners received a letter from Larry Frank saying that he was satisfied with the budget he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16381)|
| 4:33:08| I think the rumor was that the 12.9 that the mayor proposed to you was going to get cut into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16388)|
| 4:33:16| It won't be cut unless we cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16396)|
| 4:33:18| But I don't think any, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16398)|
| 4:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16400)|
| 4:33:21| Then it's a rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16401)|
| 4:33:22| I think a lot of, at the point I'm making, I think a lot of that's rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16402)|
| 4:33:24| But the fact is that the mayor's proposed budget is an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16404)|
| 4:33:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16408)|
| 4:33:30| I had another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16410)|
| 4:33:32| Some of the articles that I was reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16412)|
| 4:33:33| I think we have another question for the issue that you already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16413)|
| 4:33:38| I just wanted to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16418)|
| 4:33:39| I'm a library lover as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16419)|
| 4:33:41| And I also wanted to commend your children for sitting there so long through all this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16421)|
| 4:33:46| to wait on their mom to come up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16426)|
| 4:33:48| So hats off to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16428)|
| 4:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16432)|
| 4:33:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16433)|
| 4:33:54| One of the articles that I was reading said that the PPA that deals with utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16434)|
| 4:34:00| deals with the maintenance of the libraries, that actually what was budgeted to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16440)|
| 4:34:06| they did not use everything that was budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16446)|
| 4:34:09| And that they gave back in the year 2007 fiscal year, they gave back around $31,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16449)|
| 4:34:15| And so my question also is where does that money go back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16455)|
| 4:34:18| Does it go back into the general fund of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16458)|
| 4:34:21| Does it go back directly to the library system, which I don't think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16461)|
| 4:34:26| And my second question was when I have a lost book or a damaged book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16466)|
| 4:34:34| let's say my dog chewed up my book, and I have to replace that book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16474)|
| 4:34:39| I write a check, and that check is to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16479)|
| 4:34:43| It's to the library general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16483)|
| 4:34:46| And my question is why does it go back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16486)|
| 4:34:50| Why doesn't it go directly to the library for them to replace the book in which my dog chewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16490)|
| 4:34:57| So I'm just kind of curious as to where the funds are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16497)|
| 4:35:04| That would be a question for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16504)|
| 4:35:07| Or for Larry Franks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16507)|
| 4:35:09| John, you want to answer her question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16509)|
| 4:35:13| I thought you got away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16513)|
| 4:35:16| No, I'd like to say thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16516)|
| 4:35:19| Part of what you'll hear from PBA is that they differentiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16519)|
| 4:35:24| or they break down their budget into a whole group of different segments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16524)|
| 4:35:29| And the library by branch is one segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16529)|
| 4:35:33| And so if not all the money is spent for the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16533)|
| 4:35:36| then that stays with the library's portion of what's on deposit with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16536)|
| 4:35:40| So the library gets credit for that for future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16540)|
| 4:35:43| And second, the funds that you write to the library, to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16543)|
| 4:35:48| are on deposit for the library fund and they're only used for library purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16548)|
| 4:35:52| So it stays with the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16552)|
| 4:35:54| We deposit it to the trustee's office, but it stays with the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16554)|
| 4:35:58| It stays within that line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16558)|
| 4:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16560)|
| 4:36:01| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16561)|
| 4:36:04| Seeing no other names, I guess we move into discussion of the FY208-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16564)|
| 4:36:13| Proposed Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16573)|
| 4:36:19| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16583)|
| 4:36:24| I think one of the first things we need to maybe discuss, just for myself to know which way we're going to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16584)|
| 4:36:32| is the commission leaning toward borrowing the $40 million or reducing spending of county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16592)|
| 4:36:50| or someone going to propose an increase in property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16610)|
| 4:36:55| I think it's hard to work on a budget until we know what the revenue is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16615)|
| 4:37:00| but it would help me a lot if I knew how the commission felt about going in debt more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16620)|
| 4:37:06| We've read about it in different articles for the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16626)|
| 4:37:12| I think I mentioned it at the budget address of the mayor that I thought that may be one of the first questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16632)|
| 4:37:17| we need to see how the commission feels about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16637)|
| 4:37:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16643)|
| 4:37:26| Well, actually, we've been here for a little over ten hours now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16646)|
| 4:37:31| and what I was going to suggest is that we adjourn for the day and reconvene tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16651)|
| 4:37:37| and discuss this after we've rested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16657)|
| 4:37:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16660)|
| 4:37:41| It's too short a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16661)|
| 4:37:45| Too short a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16665)|
| 4:37:46| Any other suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16666)|
| 4:37:49| If we set up another meeting, we have to give seven days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16669)|
| 4:37:54| That's why I was thinking if we just recess this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16674)|
| 4:37:57| It doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16677)|
| 4:37:58| I think it's three days' notice, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16678)|
| 4:38:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16680)|
| 4:38:01| Well, is everybody okay with rescheduling, with continuing this later on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16681)|
| 4:38:07| We have some more lights on, so let's see what comes out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16687)|
| 4:38:10| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16690)|
| 4:38:13| Just to save time, do we want to see if we want to have this meeting or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16693)|
| 4:38:16| Because I think that what Commissioner Moore is talking about is really on the capitalization fund is the $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16696)|
| 4:38:23| Well, we need to have another meeting on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16703)|
| 4:38:25| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16705)|
| 4:38:26| I'll just turn my light off to save time here then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16706)|
| 4:38:31| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16711)|
| 4:38:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16712)|
| 4:38:34| I think the only thing we need to do right now is decide what date we want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16714)|
| 4:38:39| Mr. Chairman, do you have any ideas of when that date should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16719)|
| 4:38:46| What's available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16726)|
| 4:38:48| When is this room available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16728)|
| 4:38:49| And then try to figure out when we can come back because we're going to need a whole day, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16729)|
| 4:38:56| at least to go through all the questions that Commissioner Moore just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16736)|
| 4:39:01| Do we want cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16741)|
| 4:39:02| What's our capital budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| What's our tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16745)|
| 4:39:07| Is it a combination of all those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16747)|
| 4:39:11| Where do you have cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16751)|
| 4:39:12| All those things are going to take a long time to get through and it changes everything as you go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16752)|
| 4:39:20| So I think at this point we just need to pick a date and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16760)|
| 4:39:25| The Finance Committee meets on Monday, I believe, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16765)|
| 4:39:28| That's their committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| The government is going to meet on Tuesday at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16770)|
| 4:39:35| I don't know if we want to come back on Wednesday next week or whatever date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16775)|
| 4:39:42| Wednesday the 18th is open, so Monday the 16th is not, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16782)|
| 4:39:51| Well, that's my anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16791)|
| 4:39:52| I'm going to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16792)|
| 4:39:54| Well, Wednesday the 18th is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16794)|
| 4:39:58| Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that since finance is going to be talking about it on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16798)|
| 4:40:06| we can address some of these issues Monday at a government meeting, perhaps some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16806)|
| 4:40:11| We'll be going over it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16811)|
| 4:40:13| And then Wednesday, since it is available, since we've gone over it Monday and Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16813)|
| 4:40:17| I vote for Wednesday and just go ahead and let's get in here and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16817)|
| 4:40:22| I'll make it in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16822)|
| 4:40:24| I'll make a motion that we meet on Wednesday at 830 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16824)|
| 4:40:28| At what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16828)|
| 4:40:30| 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16830)|
| 4:40:33| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16833)|
| 4:40:34| No, I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16834)|
| 4:40:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16835)|
| 4:40:38| My only thing is to make sure that, you know, commissioners are available for that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16838)|
| 4:40:46| I'll be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16846)|
| 4:40:48| Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16848)|
| 4:40:52| The 16th is 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16852)|
| 4:40:55| Yes, that's finance, but also it's availability of this room as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16855)|
| 4:40:59| It is available on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16859)|
| 4:41:00| It's not available the rest of that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16860)|
| 4:41:04| Part of that, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16864)|
| 4:41:06| if you just make sure that that includes all budgetary items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16866)|
| 4:41:10| that includes the tax rate, the budget, the capital, all those things that we deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16870)|
| 4:41:16| Anything having to do with money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16876)|
| 4:41:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16878)|
| 4:41:19| We've got a 9-1-1 board meeting at 830, but it'll last about an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16879)|
| 4:41:22| So I don't know, John Troyer may be there, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16882)|
| 4:41:26| John Troyer, no, he won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16886)|
| 4:41:29| You want to drift it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16889)|
| 4:41:35| Yeah, I do want to report that we have had several, and I'm making a list here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16895)|
| 4:41:39| several suggestions from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16899)|
| 4:41:42| Our chairman asked commissioners to report some proposed amendments to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16902)|
| 4:41:46| I have collected those, and I plan to distribute those on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16906)|
| 4:41:51| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16911)|
| 4:41:52| We can probably do that before Monday to get them out to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16912)|
| 4:41:55| at least to know the proposals so far, at least amendments for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16915)|
| 4:41:59| We'll get those in written form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16919)|
| 4:42:01| And I do want to say that next week I am scheduled to represent Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16921)|
| 4:42:05| at the National GFOA Conference, and so I am Tennessee's representative to that conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16925)|
| 4:42:12| Is that the whole week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16932)|
| 4:42:13| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16933)|
| 4:42:16| But you said Ann would be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16936)|
| 4:42:20| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16940)|
| 4:42:22| Ann and Chris are available here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16942)|
| 4:42:24| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16944)|
| 4:42:27| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16947)|
| 4:42:28| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16948)|
| 4:42:32| Well, we can go ahead with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16952)|
| 4:42:33| My question is not to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16953)|
| 4:42:36| I have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16956)|
| 4:42:37| Commissioner Hammond, you've got a question to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16957)|
| 4:42:39| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| Is what we're talking about Wednesday a workshop-style meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16961)|
| 4:42:44| Are we talking about a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16964)|
| 4:42:46| Yeah, probably a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16966)|
| 4:42:47| Workshop-style meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16967)|
| 4:42:48| Put the whole budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16968)|
| 4:42:51| Will there or will there not be a formal vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16971)|
| 4:42:53| Will they save that for the actual commission meeting, the formal vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16973)|
| 4:42:57| I mean, it doesn't matter to me either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16977)|
| 4:42:59| I just wanted to know where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| My idea was to have a formal vote and put it all to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16981)|
| 4:43:05| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16985)|
| 4:43:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16986)|
| 4:43:07| I was just curious what was coming forward and what order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16987)|
| 4:43:12| I'd just like to put it all together, my personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16992)|
| 4:43:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16995)|
| 4:43:17| I think a workshop-style meeting and votes of the budget are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=16997)|
| 4:43:20| That's fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17000)|
| 4:43:22| Well, then it wouldn't be a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17002)|
| 4:43:23| It's just a special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17003)|
| 4:43:25| I'm thinking it's a special call meeting to deal with the budgetary items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17005)|
| 4:43:30| and that if we can come to at least ten votes, that we vote on it and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17010)|
| 4:43:37| Or if we can't come up with ten votes, then we don't have an approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17017)|
| 4:43:42| We have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17022)|
| 4:43:43| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17023)|
| 4:43:44| We can call it a special call meeting then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17024)|
| 4:43:47| But we have a meeting the next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17027)|
| 4:43:49| So if we can't come to an agreement, maybe we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17029)|
| 4:43:51| And if we don't, then we'll have another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17031)|
| 4:43:54| But let's try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17034)|
| 4:43:55| Let's try really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17035)|
| 4:43:57| My only concern is we really need Mr. Troyer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17037)|
| 4:44:08| He didn't answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17048)|
| 4:44:09| He is the finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17049)|
| 4:44:10| We're talking about the most important thing we're going to do this entire year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17050)|
| 4:44:16| and it has to deal with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17056)|
| 4:44:18| And I think it's imperative that we have Mr. Troyer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17058)|
| 4:44:24| I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17064)|
| 4:44:25| Well, I talked to John about that, and he said that he thought that he could handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17065)|
| 4:44:36| I just think it's that important that he be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17076)|
| 4:44:40| I was thinking the same thing, but he convinced me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17080)|
| 4:44:48| Yeah, I plan to be in the office on the 23rd for a full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17088)|
| 4:44:54| And if I am required or I can be here for the day, if that's the day, it's Wednesday, I can fly in for Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17094)|
| 4:45:02| Let's fly him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17102)|
| 4:45:04| Where are you flying in from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17104)|
| 4:45:06| Fort Lauderdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17106)|
| 4:45:08| Well, we hate to pull you away from Fort Lauderdale, but this time of year it's very hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17108)|
| 4:45:14| Oh, it was supposed to rain that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17114)|
| 4:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17115)|
| 4:45:17| So the motion on the floor is the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17117)|
| 4:45:20| Anyone else want to speak to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17120)|
| 4:45:22| But you can be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17122)|
| 4:45:23| You can be here on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17123)|
| 4:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17124)|
| 4:45:25| Is that on a Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17125)|
| 4:45:26| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17126)|
| 4:45:27| Wednesday, the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17127)|
| 4:45:28| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17128)|
| 4:45:30| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17130)|
| 4:45:31| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17131)|
| 4:45:32| Do you want to support the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17132)|
| 4:45:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17136)|
| 4:45:37| Are we going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17137)|
| 4:45:38| I know I can look at it online, but I guess Jolie, has the mayor's office sent detailed paper budgets of offices down to our office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17138)|
| 4:45:48| Have we asked for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17148)|
| 4:45:52| That was that packet of information that you guys got a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17152)|
| 4:46:00| But it doesn't have everybody in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17160)|
| 4:46:03| That's what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17163)|
| 4:46:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17166)|
| 4:46:07| Do we have a, and I may have overlooked it, do we have a detailed budget, say, of the chamber and the development corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17167)|
| 4:46:15| Can we get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17175)|
| 4:46:19| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17179)|
| 4:46:20| I mean, line item by, you know, employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17180)|
| 4:46:23| Commissioners, we don't maintain those budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17183)|
| 4:46:25| Now, in terms of the conventional big book that we're all familiar with, that should be on the CD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17185)|
| 4:46:29| But if you'd like a paper version of it, we'll be glad to provide that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17189)|
| 4:46:32| I got something from the chamber this week, but I just haven't had time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17192)|
| 4:46:51| Well, if I got it, I don't need you to submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17211)|
| 4:46:53| Yes, but it's a detailed line item of all your employees and your operational costs and space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17213)|
| 4:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17222)|
| 4:47:05| The second thing was I was wanting to have something because a couple of people in my community wanted to be updated on a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17225)|
| 4:47:12| So I was wanting to hold some kind of a public meeting before we passed a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17232)|
| 4:47:17| It's kind of hard to have one before we talk about the budget next Wednesday because we don't really know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17237)|
| 4:47:27| I want to schedule a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17247)|
| 4:47:33| Are you asking a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17253)|
| 4:47:35| No, I guess if I'm not satisfied, I can vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17255)|
| 4:47:43| As long as Commissioner Hammond's motion is to have a special call meeting to have all budgetary items discussed on Wednesday the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17263)|
| 4:47:53| then we're going to try to vote on them and pass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17273)|
| 4:47:55| That's what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17275)|
| 4:47:58| That was your motion, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17278)|
| 4:48:01| Does anybody understand what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17281)|
| 4:48:04| There's a little bit of uncertainty in that Commissioner Harmon said that there's another county board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17284)|
| 4:48:10| So are we saying 8-30 or are we saying after this board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17290)|
| 4:48:14| 9-1-1 board meeting meets at 8-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17294)|
| 4:48:16| But that's somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17296)|
| 4:48:17| It's over in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17297)|
| 4:48:18| Yeah, but this commissioner's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17298)|
| 4:48:19| I'm on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17299)|
| 4:48:20| The mayor's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17300)|
| 4:48:21| I didn't know if we'd be in conflict if there was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17301)|
| 4:48:24| It meets about an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17304)|
| 4:48:25| He'll probably be an hour late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17305)|
| 4:48:26| That's what he was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17306)|
| 4:48:27| Well, do we want to just start the meeting at 9-30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17307)|
| 4:48:30| That's kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17310)|
| 4:48:33| I'll amend to say we'll start at 9-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17313)|
| 4:48:37| I wish we went ahead and started at 8-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17317)|
| 4:48:40| We don't want you to miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17320)|
| 4:48:42| Well, you wouldn't have brought it up, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17322)|
| 4:48:45| Who else is on the 9-1-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17325)|
| 4:48:50| You've got the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17330)|
| 4:48:51| Well, he doesn't have to be here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17331)|
| 4:48:53| He can be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17333)|
| 4:48:56| We'll be here by 9-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17336)|
| 4:48:59| Well, if you're the only one, could we go ahead and start meeting at 8-30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17339)|
| 4:49:03| I mean, if he's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17343)|
| 4:49:04| Because then you can leave and come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17344)|
| 4:49:06| The mayor can be here at 9-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17346)|
| 4:49:12| Let's just start at 8-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17352)|
| 4:49:14| Let's start at 8-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17354)|
| 4:49:15| We meet for a special call meeting to discuss the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17355)|
| 4:49:18| and all related budgetary items Wednesday morning at 8-30 in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17358)|
| 4:49:21| Dr. Briggs, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17361)|
| 4:49:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17362)|
| 4:49:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17363)|
| 4:49:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17364)|
| 4:49:26| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17366)|
| 4:49:28| I can see there's some people getting kind of squirrely about getting out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17368)|
| 4:49:33| We have talked about grants for 10 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17373)|
| 4:49:38| and I feel like there's a little bit of need for pulling some things together here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17378)|
| 4:49:43| before we completely drop the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17383)|
| 4:49:47| But I want to know also how the fellow commissioners feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17387)|
| 4:49:51| Is there a need to pull this in a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17391)|
| 4:49:56| or are we just going to leave it where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17396)|
| 4:49:58| and then take it back up on that Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17398)|
| 4:50:03| I think we'll take it back up at committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17403)|
| 4:50:06| because it's on our agenda for the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17406)|
| 4:50:09| and people can make suggestions at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17409)|
| 4:50:13| But I also feel like, just like Commissioner Moore's questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17413)|
| 4:50:17| is someone going to make proposed cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17417)|
| 4:50:21| Someone's going to add to another line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17421)|
| 4:50:25| Whatever they're going to want to do, we're going to have to discuss that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17425)|
| 4:50:33| I mean, I don't see how you can say, well, I want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17433)|
| 4:50:38| and someone else says, I want to do all these, and I want to do all these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17438)|
| 4:50:41| and then just sort of leave it out there to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17441)|
| 4:50:47| I mean, the process has always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17447)|
| 4:50:51| and the way I think I see this going is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17451)|
| 4:50:53| is someone will make proposals of certain line items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17453)|
| 4:50:59| and it may be that we have to vote on those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17459)|
| 4:51:04| You know, in my mind, someone will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17464)|
| 4:51:07| I'm going to make a motion to approve the budget, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17467)|
| 4:51:12| and then we'll have a series of people will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17472)|
| 4:51:16| well, I want this change to it, this change to it, this change to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17476)|
| 4:51:21| and we may have to just go line by line, each change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17481)|
| 4:51:25| Do we want that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17485)|
| 4:51:26| Vote it up, vote it down, vote it up, vote it down, and just go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17486)|
| 4:51:31| Every commissioner will have a chance to put out what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17491)|
| 4:51:38| You know, that's why I think it's going to take all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17498)|
| 4:51:41| And I think that's the same thing we're going to have to do with these community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17501)|
| 4:51:44| I see that as just another part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17504)|
| 4:51:48| If someone wants to add more money to it, take money away from it, leave it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17508)|
| 4:51:54| that's just going to be the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17514)|
| 4:52:00| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17520)|
| 4:52:02| Craig, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17522)|
| 4:52:04| I just, especially with these grants, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17524)|
| 4:52:08| we had some people that spent hundreds of hours looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17528)|
| 4:52:11| Do I agree with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17531)|
| 4:52:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17532)|
| 4:52:13| There are some charities that I dearly love that didn't get any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17533)|
| 4:52:16| or didn't get near what they needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17536)|
| 4:52:18| but I just don't see how in the world 19 people who can't even agree what time we take lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17538)|
| 4:52:25| is going to agree on $2 million worth of grants when each one of us have ideas on what's important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17545)|
| 4:52:36| I just don't see any way that we're going to come to any reconciliation in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17556)|
| 4:52:42| Well, we don't have to have 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17562)|
| 4:52:44| You have to have 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| And the more that commissioners will come in with what they would like to see ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17566)|
| 4:52:56| bundled up, and prepared to make their case for why they want to do what they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17576)|
| 4:53:07| then I think that will move it along that much quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17587)|
| 4:53:10| I mean, you may come in with certain ideas, and I go, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17590)|
| 4:53:13| I hadn't thought of that, and I can agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17593)|
| 4:53:15| And then your ideas can get voted up or voted down, and my ideas could get voted up or voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17595)|
| 4:53:22| And then hopefully somehow we come together with a budget that at least 10 commissioners can vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17602)|
| 4:53:30| I've seen this since 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17610)|
| 4:53:37| A lot of budgets only get passed with 10 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17617)|
| 4:53:41| Well, and obviously the majority rules, but I guess I could see if you had four that you wanted to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17621)|
| 4:53:50| Well, if one of those were one that I wanted to stay the way it was, then I mean, I can just see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17630)|
| 4:53:56| If each one of us have two or three that we want to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17636)|
| 4:54:01| that's 60 different changes made to 132 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17641)|
| 4:54:08| I mean, I can just see that being a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17648)|
| 4:54:10| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17650)|
| 4:54:12| I mean, I see no way of coming to a consensus even with 10 people agreeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17652)|
| 4:54:19| It's going to be back and forth, back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17659)|
| 4:54:22| Victoria may have something that's important to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17662)|
| 4:54:24| Paul may have something that's important to him, and Larry has something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17664)|
| 4:54:28| And, you know, I'm like, well, if Paul takes that away, then it takes money away from my charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17668)|
| 4:54:34| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17674)|
| 4:54:36| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17676)|
| 4:54:38| But you still have to remember the whole legislative process of give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17678)|
| 4:54:43| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17683)|
| 4:54:44| And compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17684)|
| 4:54:46| And, you know, how many items out there are drop dead that if you don't get it, you're not going to vote for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17686)|
| 4:54:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17695)|
| 4:54:58| So you're going to have to make, as a commissioner, make those tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17698)|
| 4:55:03| I'm prepared to make those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17703)|
| 4:55:04| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17704)|
| 4:55:06| And it might be, you know, if we're talking $10,000 here, $10,000 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17706)|
| 4:55:10| and I know that's a lot of money and we don't need to waste not one dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17710)|
| 4:55:16| but within a $640 some odd million budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17716)|
| 4:55:24| if we can somehow find a way to bundle it up that we have a balanced budget at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17724)|
| 4:55:32| I don't see a few thousand dollars here or a few thousand dollars there is going to affect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17732)|
| 4:55:39| if that's all we're talking about as far as community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17739)|
| 4:55:43| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17743)|
| 4:55:45| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17745)|
| 4:55:47| The only other thing that I'd say, it seems to me that all this time that we've spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17747)|
| 4:55:53| all the time that the panels have spent in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17753)|
| 4:55:57| it's going to take us a little bit of time to iron out what is it that we want to do with this $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17757)|
| 4:56:05| And I just somehow feel like I don't know that another session is necessary for finalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17765)|
| 4:56:13| how the grants are going to be broken down as necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17773)|
| 4:56:18| but there's something about this process that we just need to confirm that these people are doing good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17778)|
| 4:56:28| and just say thank you by either accepting or rejecting these in a very clear way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17788)|
| 4:56:40| and kind of in a separate way almost from the rest of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17800)|
| 4:56:43| But I don't, you know, I'm just trying to get some clarity to the grant process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17803)|
| 4:56:48| and I'm just thinking it's fuzzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17808)|
| 4:56:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17813)|
| 4:56:55| William, what you were saying, I'm sort of in agreement with what you're doing, and Tony, same thing as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17815)|
| 4:57:01| Folks, if we get in here and we've got, what, 132 people with grants, I'd hate to be one on the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17821)|
| 4:57:06| because if we go through this and we start to talk, those non-profits at the bottom are going to get nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17826)|
| 4:57:10| because some of the people that may want to fund some of the ones at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17830)|
| 4:57:13| then they start readjusting funds, and we're out of money in no time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17833)|
| 4:57:17| And the people in the bottom, you know, they're going to be hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17837)|
| 4:57:20| So I'm sort of like with what Tony's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17840)|
| 4:57:22| At this point, I'm ready to say you people, the citizens did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17842)|
| 4:57:26| Let's vote with it, and we'll tweak it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17846)|
| 4:57:31| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17851)|
| 4:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17853)|
| 4:57:34| I'm going to propose something that is going to require all of us to do quite a bit of homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17854)|
| 4:57:39| when we get home until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17859)|
| 4:57:42| I think that we should take the everybody has 100% of a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17862)|
| 4:57:48| and you break it down on these grants, and you designate what percentage you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17868)|
| 4:57:54| after you look at what each of the panel has designated the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17874)|
| 4:58:01| I think if we would go through with all 130, and I know that if you only have 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17881)|
| 4:58:06| maybe some line items are going to be zero, maybe some might be .5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17886)|
| 4:58:12| However you want it, you determine based upon what we've heard today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17892)|
| 4:58:17| based upon all the information that we got from all the different volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17897)|
| 4:58:20| who served on the panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17900)|
| 4:58:22| And then if we would compile all that data and be able to come up with an average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17902)|
| 4:58:29| maybe that would be, it would just cut out a lot of bickering and quabbling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17909)|
| 4:58:34| and try to do it with some sort of mathematical rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17914)|
| 4:58:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17920)|
| 4:58:41| What do you all think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17921)|
| 4:58:47| I kind of like the bickering and quabbling myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17927)|
| 4:58:52| The blogs love it and the media loves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17932)|
| 4:58:54| But, no, in listening to the grant process, I've made notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17934)|
| 4:59:00| We've had 75 presentations today, and I've gone through and I've made notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17940)|
| 4:59:04| and I intend to come back with a proposal that some of these be modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17944)|
| 4:59:09| because just in my own mind, after hearing what people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17949)|
| 4:59:13| I appreciate the work that the panel has done, and I want to follow their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17953)|
| 4:59:16| but I do believe it needs some tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17956)|
| 4:59:18| But I'm not sure coming up with a formula and doing an averaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17958)|
| 4:59:22| I'm not real sure how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17962)|
| 4:59:24| So I know everybody's got their own ideas as to what they want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17964)|
| 4:59:28| And I think if everybody came up with a designated way to spend 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17968)|
| 4:59:33| and then all of those for every single grant applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17973)|
| 4:59:39| if we took an average of how much each commissioner would have allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17979)|
| 4:59:43| after they took all the information together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17983)|
| 4:59:46| and there was an average of what the commissioners all designated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17986)|
| 4:59:50| which would be very easy to do in a spreadsheet form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17990)|
| 4:59:53| then we could quabble, and that would not be maybe the final analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17993)|
| 4:59:57| but that would at least give us something to look at without wasting a whole lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=17997)|
| 5:00:03| It would require more time on our end personally prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18003)|
| 5:00:10| and maybe less quabbling during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18010)|
| 5:00:15| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18015)|
| 5:00:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18018)|
| 5:00:20| I mean, I still think, is there any way today that we could get a feeling from this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18020)|
| 5:00:27| about going in debt or another cutting revenue or reduced spending or property tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18027)|
| 5:00:40| I mean, as I go home and I start looking at this budget again, if we've got the $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18040)|
| 5:00:45| John, are we borrowing how much out of fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18045)|
| 5:00:50| Are we borrowing $7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18050)|
| 5:00:59| For the general fund, our proposal is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18059)|
| 5:01:03| But are you taking anything out of fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18063)|
| 5:01:05| Yeah, it's on page 31 of your book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18065)|
| 5:01:08| I don't have my book with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18068)|
| 5:01:09| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18069)|
| 5:01:11| It identifies it by fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18071)|
| 5:01:15| Okay, how much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18075)|
| 5:01:17| $8.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18077)|
| 5:01:19| Okay, $8.3 million plus $40 million in bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18079)|
| 5:01:24| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18084)|
| 5:01:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18085)|
| 5:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18086)|
| 5:01:27| And if you take that $48 million, 84 point whatever, what does that equal to a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18087)|
| 5:01:33| About a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18093)|
| 5:01:35| $48 million for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18095)|
| 5:01:39| $0.60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18099)|
| 5:01:40| That would be $0.55, $0.60 tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18100)|
| 5:01:43| It would be $0.60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18103)|
| 5:01:45| The mayor is not proposing a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18105)|
| 5:01:48| I understand, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18108)|
| 5:01:50| I mean, I wish we could just ask a question and get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18110)|
| 5:01:53| All I'm asking you is $48 million hypothetically, what is that on the tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18113)|
| 5:02:00| Come up with it in all one year you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18120)|
| 5:02:03| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18123)|
| 5:02:04| $48 million divided by $814,000, but what the mayor is proposing is the mayor is proposing $2.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18124)|
| 5:02:11| Well, I understand that, but if we go in debt, we're passing it out down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18131)|
| 5:02:18| Somewhere someone has to repay this $613 million at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18138)|
| 5:02:25| So it helps me to go home and look at this budget to see if there's things that we need to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18145)|
| 5:02:32| or if the commission is happy with borrowing this money, then I don't have to do as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18152)|
| 5:02:37| because I can concentrate somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18157)|
| 5:02:40| But if we're thinking about passing a budget next Wednesday, I'd like to know the feeling of the commission today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18160)|
| 5:02:45| so it gives me an opportunity to look at a budget in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18165)|
| 5:02:48| Yeah, let me just add to it while we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18168)|
| 5:02:51| Last year this body adopted a five-year capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18171)|
| 5:02:55| and for the second year of the capital plan, which is 08-09 is what you're considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18175)|
| 5:02:59| that second year of the five-year capital plan recommended, it was approved by this body, $46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18179)|
| 5:03:06| This proposal before you is $6 million less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18186)|
| 5:03:11| This proposal before you is also $120 million for the full five-year term, different than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18191)|
| 5:03:19| So we've reduced that significantly, but I'm glad that you brought up $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18199)|
| 5:03:24| and that's something that we can talk about and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18204)|
| 5:03:27| But I do want to at least recognize that it's significantly less than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18207)|
| 5:03:32| Well, I understand that, but economic times are different than they were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18212)|
| 5:03:38| And, you know, people may have planned on taking four vacations this year or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18218)|
| 5:03:43| Maybe you take one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18223)|
| 5:03:44| They've had to change their plan, just like our capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18224)|
| 5:03:47| It's just a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18227)|
| 5:03:49| It's not something that's guaranteed that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18229)|
| 5:03:53| But, Mr. Chairman, is there a way today that we can get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18233)|
| 5:04:00| I'm okay with borrowing $40 million to see if there's a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18240)|
| 5:04:03| so it makes it easier to try to see how we work the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18243)|
| 5:04:12| I'm not for a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18252)|
| 5:04:14| But are you for borrowing $40 million or for reduced spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18254)|
| 5:04:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18257)|
| 5:04:18| It's a 49.2 cent tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18258)|
| 5:04:23| If we were going to pay for it all at one time, and you take, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18263)|
| 5:04:26| if you're going to build a road and it's good for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18266)|
| 5:04:28| should everybody pay for that whole investment now or should you pay for it over the life of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18268)|
| 5:04:32| I just answered his question, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18272)|
| 5:04:34| Yeah, but you're going to, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18274)|
| 5:04:36| In 2002, when we all came into office, we owed $400 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18276)|
| 5:04:42| And this year we're looking at $613 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18282)|
| 5:04:48| You know, at some point in time in 2010, some of this commission is going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18288)|
| 5:04:53| Some of the commissioners are leaving in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18293)|
| 5:04:57| So I think it's important we need to understand what we want to do instead of coming here Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18297)|
| 5:05:02| and start talking about do we want to borrow, do we want to reduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18302)|
| 5:05:06| because then it opens up a whole different thinking process of trying to come up with a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18306)|
| 5:05:14| And all I'm trying to do today is get, like, a straw vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18314)|
| 5:05:17| is people in favor of borrowing the money, reduced spending, or a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18317)|
| 5:05:28| I mean, I guess if we could just ask on each one and maybe get a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18328)|
| 5:05:34| How many for a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18334)|
| 5:05:38| Just so you know, for $48 million, I recalculated it's $0.59, $0.59.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18338)|
| 5:05:46| I thought we were talking about $40 million borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18346)|
| 5:05:48| You said $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18348)|
| 5:05:49| You said $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18349)|
| 5:05:50| You're taking $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18350)|
| 5:05:52| You're not wanting to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18352)|
| 5:05:53| You're not wanting to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18353)|
| 5:05:56| To cover $48 million, you need a $0.59 tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18356)|
| 5:06:00| Okay, you're trying to go to zero, unbalanced, taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18360)|
| 5:06:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18363)|
| 5:06:04| You're trying to show up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18364)|
| 5:06:07| Commissioner Moore, what I'd be in favor of is when we, as citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18367)|
| 5:06:13| voted for the pension, sheriff's pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18373)|
| 5:06:16| it was on there that there could be an $0.08 property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18376)|
| 5:06:21| The people voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18381)|
| 5:06:22| I would like to see that, which does help relieve some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18382)|
| 5:06:27| Is it going to relieve all of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18387)|
| 5:06:28| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18388)|
| 5:06:30| But I think at least that gets us on the right track to where we're not just borrowing, borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18390)|
| 5:06:35| borrowing taken from general fund, taken from whatever, a rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18395)|
| 5:06:40| whatever to continue operating government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18400)|
| 5:06:42| And I hate tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18402)|
| 5:06:44| I want to see more efficient government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18404)|
| 5:06:46| But I think we can do the two, more efficient government, find a better way to operate government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18406)|
| 5:06:54| but also an $0.08 tax increase that was voted on and was never implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18414)|
| 5:07:01| $0.08 gives you $6,504,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18421)|
| 5:07:08| Which is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18428)|
| 5:07:11| Not even to cover the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18431)|
| 5:07:13| Well, I think the debt service on the pension on our side, the county side, is what, 3.8, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18433)|
| 5:07:19| 3.85?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18439)|
| 5:07:20| That payment's on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18440)|
| 5:07:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18441)|
| 5:07:22| But then there's operating deposits, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18442)|
| 5:07:24| And what's that, seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18444)|
| 5:07:27| 10.5% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18447)|
| 5:07:30| But have you done an average of the Sheriff's Department employees who have over the years of, say, is it 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18450)|
| 5:07:37| they get 12%, a magic 12, other county employees to see if it's a net-net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18457)|
| 5:07:42| or are we really giving the Sheriff's Department employees, deputies, more than we're giving other county employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18462)|
| 5:07:50| I think at 10 years, at five years it's 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18470)|
| 5:07:55| At 10 years, it's 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18475)|
| 5:07:57| At 15 years, I think it's 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18477)|
| 5:07:59| So up to 15 years, other county employees are putting in 12%, getting a magic 12%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18479)|
| 5:08:05| while Sheriff's deputies are getting 10.5% if they make the additional 6% of their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18485)|
| 5:08:13| So they have to contribute as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18493)|
| 5:08:14| They're only contributing the 6% even within this plan, right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18494)|
| 5:08:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18498)|
| 5:08:19| See, and the other thing, too, we're having to take that money that that 8% would have covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18499)|
| 5:08:25| we're having to take that money out of our operating revenues to pay for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18505)|
| 5:08:30| instead of giving it to schools or road paving and, Scott, the things you discussed last time about being important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18510)|
| 5:08:37| And I think that, you know, the people voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18517)|
| 5:08:41| Now, you know, obviously it was a close vote, but majority wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18521)|
| 5:08:45| And while I don't want to see my property taxes go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18525)|
| 5:08:48| and I don't want to see them go up on people who are struggling to even pay for fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18528)|
| 5:08:53| it is something that was voted on, and I think it's something we're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18533)|
| 5:09:00| Well, I guess the next question is, Mr. Chairman, is you might want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18540)|
| 5:09:04| how many people are in favor of barring the $40 million plus 8.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18544)|
| 5:09:17| Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to raise my hand on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18557)|
| 5:09:19| We've been here 10 hours, and I think that we need to be clear of mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18559)|
| 5:09:22| and I don't know that I'm clear of mind right now to say to commit to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18562)|
| 5:09:26| I know that we're meeting on Monday, we're going to meet on Tuesday, we're going to meet on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18566)|
| 5:09:30| I'm all in favor of taking the information we've got, looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18570)|
| 5:09:33| so I'm not going to be drawn into do I support a tax increase or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18573)|
| 5:09:37| would I support this or not, after having been here for 10 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18577)|
| 5:09:40| And I understand what you're saying, and I appreciate what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18580)|
| 5:09:43| but I'm going to abstain from voting on anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18583)|
| 5:09:46| or I'm not actually voting or doing any kind of indication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18586)|
| 5:09:49| But I would like it if someone can get the floor, if you would ask for adjournment, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18589)|
| 5:09:54| Well, I'd like to finish one more thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18594)|
| 5:09:57| If we can't figure that out today, then I'd ask that we not approve a budget formally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18597)|
| 5:10:03| on Wednesday, we wait until . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18603)|
| 5:10:05| Well, you've got your vote on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18605)|
| 5:10:10| Mr. Chairman, there's no way that we can go through these grants like William Daniels is talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18610)|
| 5:10:17| and Tony Norman over there on Wednesday and also this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18617)|
| 5:10:21| There's no way we can do all this in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18621)|
| 5:10:24| You see what we're getting into, so I'm going to make a motion that we don't vote on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18624)|
| 5:10:29| and that we take the grants on Wednesday and set another day for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18629)|
| 5:10:32| Well, that would be a reconsideration of the vote we just took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18632)|
| 5:10:37| Well, I just don't see with all this discussion coming up how we can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18637)|
| 5:10:42| John, are you going to be here Monday and Tuesday for the committee meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18642)|
| 5:10:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18645)|
| 5:10:47| Our finance man is not going to be here, and I've got a lot of things that I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=18647)|
