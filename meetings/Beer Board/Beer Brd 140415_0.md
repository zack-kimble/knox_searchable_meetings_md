| 0:02:02| Hello, David Kiger, 1710 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| We're missing the manager's background check, fingerprints, and manager application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Okay, Ms. Day, along with the document she just mentioned, we need the building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=131)|
| 0:02:18| So we're not quite ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Okay, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| I'll make a motion pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Is there a second? Okay, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Wait a minute, so what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| So we're missing what? Background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| A background check and fingerprints for a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| I make an alternate motion that we postpone this until the next beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| All right, all those in favor of postponing until the next beer board meeting, which is May 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| The manager's in Florida in training, and I did submit the fingerprint check. It should be in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| We talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| And I have a copy of that with me if you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| And the manager will be back from Florida in training in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| No, I don't have his background check or the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Okay, I have a copy that was given to me if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| We'd like to try to get open the second week of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| We can do the next beer board meeting if we need to, but ideally we'd like to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| The construction will be complete in another two weeks as well, about May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| What does he have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| What do you have, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| What do you say you have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| It's a fast food and burger restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| No, no, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| The documentation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| I got the fingerprints when I went to the KPD and got fingerprinted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| And they said that they had everything they needed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| The only other thing that I knew that I can do right now was the manager application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| He is in Florida training at the corporate store right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| He'll be back in two weeks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| We have your fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| We don't have the manager's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| I misunderstood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Yeah, and I didn't hear a background when that was read out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| I mean, it's just, it's been our policy if, you know, if you don't have your background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| I mean, that's probably one of the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| What's my background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Well, anybody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| The manager's background, Regan Brecht, is the one who doesn't have an application to be a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| The background check has not been finished and the fingerprints aren't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Okay, so that's not something we can do when he gets back and submits it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| No, and it needs to be done by May 27th, which is the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| All right, so we have a motion to defer to May 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=277)|

| 0:12:47| A little bit about what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Convenience store. Gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Gas station. Have you ever seen one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| It's the Marathon in Rocky Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Have you ever seen one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| He just kind of got caught up in the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Cigarettes, beef jerky, potato chips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| It's a long race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Bring your feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Okay. Marathon games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Our place on Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| It's a tough neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| It's going to be a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| Ricky Cunningham, 4710 Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you. Sergeant Hunter? No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Ms. Day? Need the fire prevention approval and surrender of the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Okay. Do I hear a motion? Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Would you tell us about our place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| It's just a little old sports bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| It's been there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| It's a preservation pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| Hello, everyone. Bernadette West, 28 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you. Sergeant Hunter? No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Ms. Day? File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Do I hear a motion? Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Tell us about the festival, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| There's two of them that I believe are on the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The first one is May 10th, which is going to be Blank Fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| It's a local newspaper that celebrates mostly music and sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| and so that's going to help benefit that magazine because he's a one-man operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| so we're helping him and the Tennessee Veterans Administration to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| And then the second one is we want to start doing a Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Scruffy City music and film festival that lasts eight days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| and this is just going to be one of the days out on the square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| which Unknown Henson is going to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Did we vote on this? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| I'm sorry. Councilman Della Voping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Yeah, I was going to ask Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| We had a discussion about this a couple weeks back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Maybe Rob. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| What's the rule when you have one of these events on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| and people are carrying open beer and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Does this give you permission to do that, or does that make problems for you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| How do we resolve the interface there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| It's actually accepted in ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I'm sure Mr. Frost probably has it pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Well, they have to work through the Office of Special Events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Market Square and World's Fair Park are the only two areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| which I believe you can have basically an unlimited number of special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| But the good news is we can do this without running into conflicts with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| We have police officers have to be located at the entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| of all the ways to go in and out of Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| It's contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| There's a police officer at each location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| So it's a festive atmosphere, but you're not constrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| to just stay on the borders of your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| No, this is a free-flowing…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| You can walk the whole square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| The reason I think we get a beer permit is allowed to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| beer to be sold actually on the Market Square area proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| and have people walking freely on the square itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| It's not unlike the Dogwood Arts Festival, Art Show, and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Rossini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Rossini. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Okay, we need to vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Thumbs up Exxon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| It's a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| I think they sell gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| It's a small company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| 2561 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Nor Sultan Rajani is missing background check and fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| For the rest of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| we need the Health Department approval and surrender of the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Okay, do I hear a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| I will make that motion to defer until the next beer meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Just May 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| May 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Okay, all those in favor of deferring to May 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I just want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I think we've already given the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| They've already got a copy for Nor Sultan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| We have the fingerprints and the background check for Arshad Rajani, but not the other owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| For both of them, we've already done for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| I have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| She's already given the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| If you wait until after the meeting, I'll speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| I do not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| So does that change where we are in terms of postponing or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| You don't have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Rob, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| They don't have the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| That's the light fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Background check and fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Mark, help you out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Part-time job, electrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| The fingerprints and the background check for one of the people is still missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| So we have got this set to be deferred to May 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| That's the motion that's on the floor, and it has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| I think I have already done it, and if I have the copy and if I submit it to her, would you consider it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| It has to be the fingerprints and the records check go through the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Yeah, we have done that already for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| And I have the copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1103)|

| 0:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Why don't we move you to the heel of the agenda, and we'll go to one other place and then come back in five minutes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| The next applicant is Twin Peaks, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1116)|

| 0:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1131)|

| 0:18:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Would you tell us about Twin Peaks, because I know it's where the old Fridays was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| We're all female-based staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1145)|

| 0:19:14| We've got 64 TVs, the smallest being a 50-inch TV in a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| So we've got, like, 1980-inch TVs, all high def.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| It's a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| We'll take your word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Let's take about a three-minute recess until we can find out about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| We have an addendum, so let's go ahead and take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1180)|

| 0:19:49| Well, good for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Casual Pint on Harvest Mill Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| The business address is 4842 Harvest Mill Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| We ran into construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Ideally, our inspection is going to happen this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| But with the holiday weekend, we just wanted to come and get an extension just in case things don't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| and we didn't get it done until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| We need to approve this pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| We need to extend it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Is there a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| All those in favor of extending 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Next is the Knoxville Bicycle Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| It's like a St. Bernard when you ride up with a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| 619 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| And we were waiting for final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| What's missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| There was a confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| The city code's department thought we were going to be a bicycle-themed restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| and didn't realize that we were a bike shop just wanting to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| So they held us to stricter restrictions, so I'm just asking for a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Do I hear a motion to extend 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Well, maybe you should think about serving food as well, but that's probably not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| So 30 days, you'll have this done and pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Can I ask a question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Sir, before you leave, these are folks that come and sort of hang out while they're waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| for their bike to be fixed and they're going to have something to self-amuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Is there like a little counter or something, or are they just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| We actually have the bar from the old Corner BP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| It's already in the shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| We're a bike shop that just wants to offer beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Our beer business will probably be less than $1,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| But it will make your customers at least enjoy their wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Stick around and hopefully buy more bike stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Put trainer wheels on the back in case you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Maybe a bike taxi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Sergeant Hunter, would you tell us the situation on Thumbs Up Exxon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Apparently there was some kind of miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| While the one owner attended the task class on a Thursday and the fingerprints and background check was done on him that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| the other owner showed up and told the information window that she needed fingerprints for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| Our criminalistics unit normally does that for people needing background checks for jobs and for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| We don't go through our office and a background check isn't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| She paid for the card, had her fingerprints done, they gave her the card, and she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| So she never got a background check through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| So we still don't have a background check on her then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| We have a motion to postpone on the floor in a second for that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| So we need to postpone this until May the 27th until that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Background check completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| While we're wrapping up here, we have some people who are not in compliance serving underage who will be going to administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1398)|
| 0:23:27| It's the third offense for some of them, and we'll keep you posted on that as it unfolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| Being no other business before the beer board, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140415_201807?start=1416)|
