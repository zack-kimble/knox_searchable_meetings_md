| 0:00:00| I want to welcome everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=0)|
| 0:00:01| This is our council budget retreat and I talked with Mr. Campin, he'll be here supposedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1)|
| 0:00:09| at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=9)|
| 0:00:10| We can take some bets on that, if we want, he said he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10)|
| 0:00:15| Also one of the changes, the mayor, as you all know, you received an email, the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15)|
| 0:00:21| is going to be tied up this morning and at graduation, but she will be available at four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21)|
| 0:00:25| o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| She'll be coming down to answer any questions that go through the day, however, Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| is going to talk for the mayor in terms of what's in the budget on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=32)|
| 0:00:41| Will is out, I want to apologize if you folks want to impeach me, you can, I had assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| that we would have some breakfast food here this morning, muffins and fruit, but as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| can see, we don't, however, Will is making a run for it, so we'll see what he comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| in with on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| Okay, do we have, do we know, is Rob coming, do we know, okay, alright, so he'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=63)|
| 0:01:20| Okay, you got an email yesterday also, Savannah had sent out on the budget and her review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| and she's going to take just a few minutes and tell us what she has done on this to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| us up to date on that before we get started with Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| Okay, so if you'll look at the front page, you have kind of like a table of contents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| and that's going to tell you, the handout page is going to tell you in this little packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| where the information is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| The budget detail is, of course, the budget detail tab in the budget that you received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| last week or the week before, depending on when you picked it up, and then the summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| info page is also the info tab that's in the book, so if you want to reference those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| The last, I think, four or five pages is going to be the information on capital improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| and I believe you're supposed to be getting a printout packet of the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| at some point today, I thought we would already have them, but we don't have them yet, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| as soon as we get those, I'll give them to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| And who's bringing those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| I think it's someone from finance, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Okay, all right, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Will's getting them with the donuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Oh, I looked around, I thought you were serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| Any questions before we get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| Again, welcome everyone, this is going to be a long day, we do have lunch, and here's Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| He's arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| You want to take a quick break and get something over here, depending on what he brought, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| not sure, so we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| But Christy, we'll go ahead and get started with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| As you guys know, the mayor couldn't be here this morning, but I know she would want me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| to tell you how much she appreciates Council's good work through the 2015-16 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| She and truly all of us do rely on your guidance and participation, not only throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| year, but especially during this budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| It is our goal to provide Council with the most accurate and up-to-date information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Each of our department heads and managers will be speaking to you today, and they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| provide you a brief overview of their activities over the last year, and they're prepared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| answer any other questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I have to say I am very proud of our hard-working staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Our directors are passionate about serving this city, passionate about serving the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| and this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| It's a pleasure and honor for me to work with them to be leading this outstanding team of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| The City of Knoxville is a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| That's why we are all here, to provide services to the taxpayer and to make decisions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| strategic investments in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Those investments are needed not only to maintain what we have already built and to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| our quality of life, but also to stimulate additional investment by both the public and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| private sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| As we now all know and understand, we've seen it firsthand, investors invest their dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| where there is activity and interest, where the environment is attractive, where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| can sell or where they can rent, and where there is security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Security comes from knowing that their investment is protected because public dollars are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| used appropriately to further invest and reinvest in strategic infrastructure and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Continued growth and improvement of a city requires a vision and a commitment to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| A budget attempts to capture that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| It establishes priorities and provides a mechanism for delivering on those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Again this year we find ourselves in the midst of major new investment in the urban core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| and we are continuing to experience growth from the inside out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Our staff and directors are working hard consistently to think about how we improve the delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| of services, to pursue every other possible funding opportunity that we can find, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| to get the absolute most from each tax dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| As the Chief Operating Officer, my focus has been to improve the level of service and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| identify operating efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| As a result of our hard working staff, I am very proud to let you know that the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| Knoxville is on track this year to beat its operating budget in the 2015-16 year by 1.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| The fundamentals on which we developed this budget include no spending of fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| for recurring expenses, maintaining tight control of our operating expenses, and maximizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| capital investment by working with our public and private partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| I'll turn it over to Jim York now who is going to give us additional introductory budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| information and then we will spend time with our directors and managers where you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| can ask specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=337)|
| 0:05:48| I woke up about 3 o'clock this morning and was trying to figure out what do I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| say to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| My first answer was not much, but I think I could get away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| I thought I would try and maybe even switch into kind of like professor mode and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| about some of the structure and some of the things that I find interesting in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=369)|
| 0:06:20| Let me just give you a few basic things before we get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| I think hopefully everybody has their budget with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| If you can't, then we'll go back and try to find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| If you turn to page 7, and I'm going to be flipping back and forth, but I'll give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| the page numbers when I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| The first thing I want to talk about is what our proposed budget is for this upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| The total budget for this year is $406.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=409)|
| 0:06:59| That's up about $18 million or about 4.7% compared from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| The big changes in there, and perhaps the biggest change in there, is in what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| allocated for capital funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I'm going to hit on those here lately, but you can see that the bulk of that increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| is what we're going to be spending for capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| That's fund 401 that says capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| It's about halfway down the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| You can see that we've gone from $25.4 million a year ago to about $36.8 million proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=449)|
| 0:07:39| for 16-17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Out of that $18 million, $11 million of that growth is in capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| The general fund, again, that's the very first line on that page, and that's the major fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| It's budgeted at $212.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| It's up about $6.16 million or around 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| That's somewhat normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| That's driven primarily by expenditure growth in salaries, benefits, other compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=489)|
| 0:08:20| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Again, I'll touch on some details there in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| The other large change is probably in metro parking fund, again, and that's due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=506)|
| 0:08:36| new meters and some additional compensation that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| The other changes are, again, fairly minor, and again, I will touch on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| You can see fleet services is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Again, that's one of the big things that's driving this budget, and that is the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| of fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Our total amount for fuel in the general fund that we have allocated next year is around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| $2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| That's down about $670,000 from what we had budgeted in 15-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| CAT, in addition to general government, is about $1.56 million, and it's down about $603,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=554)|
| 0:09:25| when compared to a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Again, I know that some people think that we just make up these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| I will tell you that when we projected it, we had based oil prices based on $50 a barrel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=573)|
| 0:09:41| and that was about two and a half months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| That's what we projected that it would average over the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| At last count, oil prices were going up, and then last I saw, they were at $48.9 a gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=591)|
| 0:10:02| You can tell that we try and cut this close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Again, last year we used a much higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| I don't think anybody would have reasonably expected that prices would have dropped to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| where they were, but again, they're on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Again, we try not to build up, again, any play in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| We try and cut it as close as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| Again, the rough rule of thumb, not counting cat, we're at about $11,000 for every penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| change in the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| We average that over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| The city uses about 1.1 million gallons of gas per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| Cat uses probably another 800,000 gallons of gas or fuel a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| Again, those numbers, because they are so much lower, last year, again, we had projected $80 a barrel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| and right up until when we came to council last year, they were pegging at $77 a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| They dropped $40-plus a gallon, and like I said, I don't think anybody expected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| That's part of the process that we go through in preparing this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| One thing I want to flip over to page 9, because this is the piece that I think a lot of people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=686)|
| 0:11:35| confused about, and that is the net budget and what does the net budget mean and why is it different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| If you look at these funds, we break them down, and again, this is actually a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| We have something like 72 different funds that we budget when you get down into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| We combine a lot of them in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| We have several different types of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| The special revenue funds, those are things that have restricted type money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| For example, state street aid, that is where the state gas tax flows is restricted to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| For example, we cannot use those dollars to pay police salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| but we can use them to pay for very limited kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| City court, again, we use that to just cover the cost of court operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| If there are any excess fees, those will typically flow to the general fund, and we show that as a revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| City inspections, you know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| That is if you get a building permit, you're going to go into building inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=762)|
| 0:12:51| and all that money goes to offset the cost of building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| I see a light on, so I'm going to entertain questions at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Debt service funds are what you think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| They're what we're going to pay for general debt of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| This does not include debt on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| That's actually included under the convention center fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| But this, as you can see, total debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=800)|
| 0:13:29| not including tax increment, is around $25.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| The amount that we expect to take in from tax increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| and then flow back out is about $2.12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| So, again, that gives you some idea of what tax increments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Capital projects, we touched on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Enterprise funds and internal service funds are kind of unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Council Member Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I want to ask you about the miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Miscellaneous special revenue fund, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Could you give us an example of what those entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| That's a number of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| I'll give you some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| I can actually break it down if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| That's really esoteric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| But, for example, we have a miscellaneous special events fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and that's where we cover the cost of the ice rink, 4th of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| Christmas in the City, various events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Council has a beer board fund that fines from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| that you levy for violations of the, you know, beer ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| That's a special revenue fund, and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| we dedicate revenue to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| That's, I think that's budgeted at $25,000 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| We have, Recreation Department has, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| they take people on trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| We budget that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| That's a miscellaneous special revenue fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Also included in that are a couple of big, some big dollar funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| One is Demolition by Neglect, which is budgeted at $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Historic Preservation Fund, which is budgeted at $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Neighborhood Small Grants, which is budgeted at $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Police drug funds are included in miscellaneous special revenue funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| And we have a fund, we have a couple of funds for, like, police capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| So, for example, hopefully no one here gets a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| a violation of speeding, for speeding or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| But if you do and you pay a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| a portion of that goes to the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| that they can only use for capital dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| I think it's $20 on a, you know, court cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And that money is shown in miscellaneous special revenue funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So, again, I can go farther down if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Jim, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Is the debt service shown there, the $25 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| is that the same one that is related to the 53 cents on the tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| That specific one, not the convention center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Not the convention center one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| But I can touch on the convention center fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Oh, but that's that piece that's broken out separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Enterprise funds are things that we, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| tend to look at like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| You know, you go to events at, you know, auditorium, coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| you pay ticket prices, people rent the venue, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| And those are designed to run like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Now, unfortunately, none of our business is turn a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| So, in some cases, there are city support required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| and I'm going to touch on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Those are shown in transfers, you know, in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| So, for example, public assembly facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| much as I would like them to turn a profit, they do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Same thing with convention center, CAT, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| the city, you know, if you look at it, CAT puts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| you know, you ride CAT, you put your money in the fare boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| That's only about 10 to 11% of what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| in the way of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| The rest of it's going to come from city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| state and federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| There's some other things, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| UT makes contributions to the awards of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| and then they, you know, do some other things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| you know, charter rentals and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| But, again, that municipal golf course, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| it's another one I wish that would turn a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| but they don't, and city is required to support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Can I just add one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| They're not intended to turn a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| We do everything we can to manage them appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| but we don't expect that they're going to turn a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Or someone else would be doing it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| A private sector would be happy to take their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| So, for instance, how much, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| the public assembly facilities, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| what do they, is any of the $5 million money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| that we get from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| or is this what we're giving them in addition to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| The 5.1 million is the total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| what we're estimating the total cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| of running public assembly facilities is next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| And then how much do they actually then contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| back out of the 5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| You mean how much does the city contribute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| No, how much do they make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| In other words...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| That's a different question, but I'll give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Well, the convention center, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| we give $18 million, but they pay something back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| No, that's the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Do they get some contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| They earn money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| But they don't earn 100% of what it costs to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| So just bear with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| and I'm going to give you what the revenue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| We obviously provide a subsidy to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| But the good news is every year that I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| that subsidy continues to decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| And this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| they're also asking for less money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| to subsidize their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Same is true for the auditorium, Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| and Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Again, just for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| There's only one possible convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| that may actually turn a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| and that's the McCormick Center in Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| So we're not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Don't anyone think that we're unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| because we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| It's just a question of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| as that indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| the city support continues to go down and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| But you asked what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Is that page 10 of the revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| ...public assembly facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I'm going to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Council Member Greer's question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Out of that 5.1 on public assembly facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| they will bring in about 1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| General fund...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| General fund support is about 2.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| 2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| And then there's some other miscellaneous revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| How does that look according to the convention center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| How much do they bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I'll switch and give you a convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| The city support for the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I know is about 1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| They bring in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| just for the operations of what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| the convention center operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Just again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| bear with me while I get that data for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Jim, isn't this all on page 10 or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| The revenues by type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Yeah, you can look at it on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| That's a good place to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| and you can sort of see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| The convention center is a little trickier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| I'm going to have to break that one down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| because convention center includes World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| which you really wouldn't associate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| with World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| It also includes Loca Street Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| which is included under convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| It includes what we provide to visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| and it also includes the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| So I'm just going to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| the breakdown on operations here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| But if you were to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| you can see that the convention center...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| about that taxes piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| is basically admissions tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| that's really what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| and the city hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| there's a 3% tax on hotels inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| That's what makes up that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Intergovernmental revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| that would be what we call the TDZs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| the state amount that goes towards debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| and it includes a million and a half dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| from Knox County from their hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| to pay off debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| The charges for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| is probably the closest thing that you'll see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| about $3.7 million that they bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Miscellaneous revenue is around $233,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| And again, you can sort of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| again, follow that across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| and that'll give you a good piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| But if you bear with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| again, I can find that detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Okay, out of what we would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| the Convention Center operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| and I know they're gonna be here later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| and we're gonna give you some total money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| What the Convention Center brings in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| just not including anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| is from rentals, food and beverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| miscellaneous, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| they bring in about $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| The total cost of operating expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| not including depreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| is around 5.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| So you can see the difference in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| would have to be made up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| from transfers from other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| And so that's the city's transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| The general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| the general fund transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| just for that operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| is around 1.256,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| so about 1.256 comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| and that's for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| That does not, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| does not include depreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| It's not included from debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Now, debt, just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| no debt is paid from city property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| It all comes from other revenue sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| primarily the hotel-motel taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| the city hotel-motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| the city hotel-motel tax is a big piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| County contributes 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| We have admissions tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| going to pay off debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| and we have the TDZ money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| and last year that's the, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| supplemental income that's generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| inside the tourism development zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| or the CBID, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| The boundaries are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Last year that was around 4.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| so all of those revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| cover the debt on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| No property taxes go to pay debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| That's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Is that enough detail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| You thought it was a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| There are no simple answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Internal service funds, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| I want to point those out again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| because this one is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| We have several operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| would be fleet, health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| risk management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| our equipment replacement fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| and the rental on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Those are set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| and we operate those, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| like businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| but the accounting is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| as if you're a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| But their customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| are other departments of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| and they charge other departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So you see these inter-fund charges in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Those are charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| that they've levied against other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| So, for example, if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Spread those costs to where the actual users are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And we do that for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| One is it better shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| the true cost of operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| for example, the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| because you won't really see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| what's the true cost of fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| what's the true cost of maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| what's the true cost of insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| and so forth for having a police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| How do you capture depreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| of all their vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| And again, we have a fairly large fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Our fleet size is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| getting close to $50 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| in fleet valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| And so we, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| bill those costs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Well, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| what happens is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| those charges get double-counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| in the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| They show as a revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| to the internal service funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| They also show as an expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| in the internal service funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| And they also show as an expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| in the other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Transfers show as revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| and expenses in more than one fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| So if we back everything out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| everything that's double-counted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| that gets us back to what we're truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| going to spend that doesn't flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| And that's around $302.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| So that's really what it's going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| to operate this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Again, assuming everything comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| the way we project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| is around $303 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| So NET is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| taking out the double-counting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| which is transferred out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| coming in from feds and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| separate places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Yes, it does include federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| state grant money, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| And operating leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| all that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| No, operating is the actual pay-it-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| And it does balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| I point that out because everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| said, well, what's the real budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| And we use three different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| $406 million? Yeah, the total budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| is actually $406 million, but what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| really plan on spending is around $302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Which is still quite a bit, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| we're a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| big operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| I'm actually going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| transfers, and I think this is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| an appropriate part. If you switch over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| page 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| you can kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| a good handle on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| where things are, and that's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| from the general fund that go to other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Now, there's actually a transfer that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| into the general funds. Excess city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| court money comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| to offset general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| And there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| transfers from other funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| But you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| and there's one big change here, and I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| a quick note, because this is a really positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| kind of thing, and I know Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Aarons can talk about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| And that is the amount that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| was going to support city inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| down around $560,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| budget perspective compared to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| a year ago is. So we're getting pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| close to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| break-even on that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| on inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Now, that does not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| codes enforcement, and that is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| We've moved codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| under inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| but they are not showing in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Because we don't consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| that more of a general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| function, and if you're coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| to build a building, you wouldn't be wanting to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| for codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| There, we're just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| have permit money come as close as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| to break-even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| You say down, you mean more revenue is coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Less money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| being transferred, a lot more revenues in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| of general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| You guys may remember, you voted on increasing the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| which had not been increased for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| And we tried to find the benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| in other departments across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| What's typical for this kind of a department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| How much should the fees that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| in support the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| of that department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| We, for the first time in years and years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| are right at that benchmark now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| And so, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| is it that, but it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| a function of just really good management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| with even our signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| and zoning inspection letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Just trying to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| covering everything that we need to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| for the services that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| A couple other ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| of notes. You can see that some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| But the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| up increase is the amount that the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| is providing to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| capital projects. It's up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| $4.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| We've got $9.7 million going from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| general fund to support capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| And again, that's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| And again, I think a positive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Is that on Lorain Street mostly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| No, that does not include Lorain Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| This is, again, what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| putting in for new capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| We'll touch on capital if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| We talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| about Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| And again, Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| you can see that that transfer is actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| down about $480,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| A little less than $480,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| shows you what we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| at the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| in terms of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| And again, that's a continuation of a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| It's a little bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| this upcoming year in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| what they're generating in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| But that transfer has been steadily going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| probably over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| last five to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| And obviously the good news there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| we're just seeing a lot more events booked at our Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| We really have some great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| synergy going between Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| and the sales force at our Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| And really work well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| as a team together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| And every time I meet with them, I'm just more and more impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| We have bookings now out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Well, in 2008 it probably all dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| because nobody was going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Nobody was going anywhere. And then, as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| we also had a change up in our CVB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| And people like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| have relationships with other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| and they weren't quite sure exactly when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| talked to Knoxville who their other people were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| And now they figured it out pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| and we've had some real good stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| in our CVB and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| with the SMG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| And we're finally seeing the payoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| from all their hard work, which started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| You can actually see that the transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| for mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| and you have to kind of combine two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| the mass transit and the trolleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| what the city is providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| for operations of CAD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| is actually down about 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| A lot of that is due to fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Again, because fuel is down so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| the insurance, we've switched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| at least on terms of liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| we moved them under our self-insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| plan for liability and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| workers' comp and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| several things like that, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| And we've seen a steadily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| decrease in their insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| costs and insurance costs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| CAD next year, again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| not including healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| are down about $158,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Why is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| the trolley and CAD separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Is it just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| There's no money in the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Well, I mean, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| if you think about it, they're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| separated probably for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| reason he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| We don't generate revenue off the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| There are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| fare box revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| We might pick up a little bit of miscellaneous revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| And so we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| obviously lump them together but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| would kind of lead to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| some confusion and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| we broke it out separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| And we've broadened the service too, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Yeah, it would skew the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| if we put the trolley in there because there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| So that's why they're separated out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Number one. Number two is, yeah, we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| revise the routes but it was budget neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| The changes that we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| we just shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| service to where it was needed most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| and did a lot of outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| in the community to determine where service is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| and expanded. One of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| of course was to the Old City. Old City had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| been asking for trolley service for quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| some time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| all those changes that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| were all budget neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Are there limitations on what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| can do with our trolley system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| There's obviously limitations in funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| But in terms of, are there any other rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| that keep us from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| spreading it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Not necessarily. It's just in the CBID at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| in time and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| as things develop, we'll definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| reconsider. I think the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| changed this last one. It was long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| We had had some requests to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| how it was running and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| it was a matter of getting Dawn in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| and asking her to do the outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| with others to figure out exactly where it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| needed and I think we'll do that periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Just as an addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Christy's right, it's primarily in the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| but we did extend it to University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Commons outside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| It's really our call. I mean no policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| has been to serve the CBID because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| of the limited resources that we had. That was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| original intent but really that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| something that's up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| the city as to what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| For some reason I thought there may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| some restrictions on it but there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Self-imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| There may be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| In the budget obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| You want to keep them close to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| frequently so you stretch it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| You want to keep that 15 minute service as best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Melissa Roberson's coming later today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| because actually Dawn Disler is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| at the Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Planning Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| the large meeting. It's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Charlotte this week. So Melissa will be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| so we can ask her that question when she gets here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| if there's other restrictions that she's aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| Just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| others that I will note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| The transfer for golf courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| is up by about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| $166,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| We bought new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| golf carts, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| we have paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| the golf cart pass. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| kind of a replacement program for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| we came back to council even for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| because of the work on the golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| course and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| rounds were down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| we expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| them to pick up but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| to former levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| so the amount that we expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| support for golf courses is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| up. Well they said the younger generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| isn't doing it as much, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Well I mean again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| you can talk to Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| but what we know is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| again if you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| demographics of golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| and I don't play golf but at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I can talk about the demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| it's probably the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| golfers look more like I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| in terms of demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| than people that are in their 20s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| or 30s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| and you see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| golfing is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| designed for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| and the demographics are changing where a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| of young people do not play golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| They are playing foot golf though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| and if you guys recall we did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| an outing out there where we played foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| golf and had lots of people participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| so I think we'll see more and more of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| and you'll probably see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I've already seen more and more of that across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| if you look it up you'll see where they're playing more foot golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| which is a combination of soccer and golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| and we've done it out at Little Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| a couple of times and it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| very successful so I think we'll probably see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| more of that transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| from traditional golf to other sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| Okay again I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| kind of bouncing around but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| if you turn two pages to page 48| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I want to just touch on debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| there's no significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| there but I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| point out where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| in terms of where we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| at the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| the city will have $170 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| in debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| $110.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| of that is for the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| and about $59.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| is for things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| not related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| next year we'll pay about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| $10 million in principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| we'll pay another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| $66.4 million in interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| so our expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| payable for debt services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| is around $16.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| and most of that is for the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| unless you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| questions that's all I'll say about debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| On page 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| it looks like over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| it's supposed to step down unless we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| new debt, right? Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Yes, again you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| see it's sort of level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I think we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| show you where the maturities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| where they roll off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| it steps down in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| $19.20 a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| it steps down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| again in $24.25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| and it steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| way down in $32.33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and that picture includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| that's when the convention center rolls off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| and that picture includes the $30 million that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| took out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| There'll be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| But again for I think most of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| tenure I think it's all going to be level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| Again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| let's just turn over to page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| 52| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I'm not going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| capital I'm going to let departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I'm just going to talk in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| and I'm going to talk about funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| The biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| difference is again what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| were able to package together and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| from the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| About $9.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| last year the general fund was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| $4.4 so you can see about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2470)|

| 0:41:36| $3.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| A big portion of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| we've got some federal and state grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| coming in for capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2502)|

| 0:41:46| from year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| fluctuates widely from year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| but again those are the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2510)|

| 0:42:04| to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2524)|

| 0:42:48| much of an apples to apples comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2570)|

| 0:42:54| No there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| The biggest portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| again we're a city we keep harping on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| all the time the biggest portion of our revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| salaries and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2588)|

| 0:43:16| budgeted next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| again this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| includes pension with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2602)|

| 0:43:28| Now that's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2608)|

| 0:43:34| tried to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| if you actually went and tried to compare this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| to last year's budget that will actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| be down about $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| but that's not a true apples to apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| comparison because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| of the way we're now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2626)|

| 0:43:54| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| we would actually be up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| compared to last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Now within that category just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| salaries themselves are around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| $82.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| again if we had a true apples to apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| comparison we would be up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| $1.43| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2650)|

| 0:44:20| Is that mostly the 2.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| That is mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| the 2.5% but it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| includes some changes related to the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| survey so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2668)|

| 0:44:58| in other forms of compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2698)|

| 0:45:02| is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| $5.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| making the adjustments we would be up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| around $141,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| when compared to last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| I know you specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| ask about longevity I can get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| longevity what the city pays for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| longevity pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| and it typically stays about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| each year because we have people going off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| and people coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| is around $1.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| is what we pay for longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Does that keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| the spread between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| the little classes in the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| system that you add longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Well longevity pay you get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| after you have been here 4 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| and it starts out at $120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| rises up to $2,400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| and again as people retire off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| That changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| but you have new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| that are new hires and they come off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| so again if I were to actually track that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| multiple years it's going to be around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| $1.8 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| that's been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| for more than 28 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| I can tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| I don't know when it started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| more than 28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I have a question Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| about salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| I think the lowest paid salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| now is $10 an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| is that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| It's actually higher than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| $10 an hour and we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| to raise it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| don't hold me to this because I'd have to look it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| I want to say it's getting close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| $10.90 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| somewhere in that $10.90 an hour range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2807)|

| 0:48:01| we actually don't have very many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2881)|

| 0:48:19| they have different salaries depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| they're part time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| the event workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| do not get benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| they only work events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| they're typically also part time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and then a lot of them are also temporary workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| yeah I mean those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| true seasonal ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2917)|

| 0:48:51| fifteen hundred and fifty five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| is I think the budget number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| maybe one or two off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| and then part time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| we don't have that many full part time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| we have about thirty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| thirty to thirty two part time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| fifteen sixty six right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| but now event workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| if you count what I call the event workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| and again those are the parks and rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| people that work the events at parks and rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| we probably have three to four hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| and they change over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2963)|

| 0:49:27| people that work at the ice rink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| you know other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| referees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| they're well over three hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| and there may be as many as four hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| depending on the season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| for those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I'm going to go back to that longevity bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| uh huh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| so tell me again the math on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| how much is it per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| what did you say four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| once you've been here four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| you get a hundred and twenty dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| and it increases a hundred and twenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| dollars per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| thereafter for as long as you're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| and it maxes out at twenty four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3003)|

| 0:50:15| forty years but they've maxed out long before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3015)|

| 0:50:57| forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| are what we pay in benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| and again just bear in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| we got seventy two point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| six million in salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| what we pay in benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| or expect to pay in benefits next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| is forty two point six million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| that's more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| so more than fifty percent of salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| is what we pay in benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| and again that's social security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| medicare pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| so again you just look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| what we're paying in benefits is more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| fifty percent of salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| and it's going to vary by individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| you know particularly on health care side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| does that include the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| contributions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| that does not include the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| pension is a city contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| only for pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| that's about twenty four million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| yeah it's around twenty four million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| it's actually down from a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| now a portion of that's due to the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| in the auditorium coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| but another reason is because of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| and council member Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| is well aware of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| we did some things this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| where we recognized some revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| to try and lower that city contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| what that has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| I know I drew a little graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| for the council member the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| the pension contribution will still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| be going up now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| if you looked at that line it was still going to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| for about four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| and then it would still go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| at a lower rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| it kind of levels off and it drops off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| in like twenty two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| by what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| did last year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| we haven't changed the direction of that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| at all but we have lowered it by about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| somewhere close to five hundred thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| a year so that line has actually dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| now pension contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| are still going to go up next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| they are going to go up year after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| you know unless we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| extraordinary gains in the marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| the amount that they are going to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| is actually lower than what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| was two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| years ago. The rate of growth is slowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| is it? The rate of growth is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| the same but again because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| what we did in terms of recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| of that ten million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| dollars that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| council did a few years back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| we haven't changed the direction of the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| at all that hasn't changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| we've just lowered it by about five hundred thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| shifted downwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| same slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| we have shifted that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| so pension is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| contribution is down but it's still sizable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| and again it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| around twenty four million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| a little less than twenty four point two million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| is what we forecast for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| the amount just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| current active city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| again is twenty two million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| roughly and on top of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| we have to make another one point seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| million dollars contribution for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| former school employees and that's for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| unfunded liability on former school employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| is the other big benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| healthcare is that the biggest next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| pension? Pension is the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| healthcare would be the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| largest. Is that about twenty million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Total amount that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| contributes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| healthcare is around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| thirteen and a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| and then we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| social security and medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| I was looking at the entry on page nine and it had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| twenty point nine million but I don't know what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| well twenty point nine is really what it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| for healthcare but what the city's contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I see everyone's share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| adds into that twenty million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| that twenty million also includes things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| dental and I just did healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| per se, dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| city's contribution for dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| is you know around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| eighty four thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| we've got vision that's not very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| again that's around ninety thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| there's some other benefits in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| but the twenty million that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| covers the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| employee cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| the city's contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| the retirees portion includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| it includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| the amount for waived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| we have some contribution for waived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| we have about again ninety thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| dollars for people that waive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| there are a lot of voluntary benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| that people participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| in you know it also includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| long term disability so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| where the twenty million comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| but again just what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| the city's got for healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| per se not including retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| around thirteen and a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| and that initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| to do things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Fitbit stepping and everything is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| lowering the cost some right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| What we have seen and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| in our healthcare cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| we haven't stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| the market place is going up thirty percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| the market place is going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| at a much higher rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| been able to slow those increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I think we run a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| good healthcare program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| we watch things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| we stay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| the changes in the market place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| and again I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| will say this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| that way I won't have to say it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| what we have done if you look at some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| the things and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| what we do is we try and keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| track of all the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| in the market place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| there are ways to gain healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| one of the ways to gain is in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| of the specialty drugs, compounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| things and we have seen some of our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| really get burned because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| weren't on top of it and people would start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| going to a druggist and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| would pay these outrageous amounts for drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| that are compounded because those aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| capped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| not factory made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| not factory made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| if you combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| two things now it may be pretty cheap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| but once it becomes a compound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| drug it's not basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| controlled under your insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| manufacturers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| so people really start making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| exorbitant claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| profits go up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| seven, eight hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| percent on compound drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| we have been able to track that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| we have been able to watch that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| specialty drugs are very expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| there are some drugs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| if you get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| those drug regiments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| particularly some of the newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| genetically modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| type drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| those can be very expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| stay out in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| we want people to get the healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| but not be out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| on some experimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| type things that we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| provide the bang for the buck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| just by watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| a cancer drug or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| a new cancer drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| one that's way out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| that's really expensive is new hep C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| and people hear about these and they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| is that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| those are real niche| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| but people hear about them and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| well okay I've been exposed to hep C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| and I want to take this drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| that drug may cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| $400,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| may not have any more benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| unless you're just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| that real narrow niche| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| it won't have anything more than something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| that might cost you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| $3,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| so again we're looking at those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| we want our employees to be healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| we want our employees to receive the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| kind of care we do but we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| we recognize that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| a value and we want to provide value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| on that health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| and again the fit bits and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| what we are seeing is that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| we hope that we will have a healthier population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| those in turn will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| lower the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| so Jim is someone monitoring the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| drugs I noticed the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| that we went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| a drug that was costing $40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| all of a sudden cost $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| yeah we do monitor the cost of drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| drug companies plan on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| side of the thing they just may tweak it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| bit and all of a sudden it goes off our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| list and now they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| charged outrageous prices but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| we do have people that specialize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| in that and we have people looking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| again for the city and again for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| you know I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| to make this entirely about money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| because we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| we will recognize those drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| but we know that what people do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| is again they hear things on TV commercials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| and that may not be the best drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| people to be conscious of their health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| and we want healthier employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| because healthier employees are better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| for you know the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| and you know conversely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| they also in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| lower the cost but it's not just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| lowering costs it's about having a healthier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| but again that was kind of a long winded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| answer to council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| I don't even know who asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| about the $13.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| is 50% high for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| fringe benefit I mean would you normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| figure 35% or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| no I don't well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| again a large portion of that is pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| that kind of skews it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| because again we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| some pretty high pension rates and again part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| is for the unfunded liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| and again I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| say that even our pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| you know we talk a lot about pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| but compared to our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| we are in a lot better shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| you know many of our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| what we do in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| our pension system I think is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| even some of the better ones are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| much you know not much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| more funded than we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| now again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| and I say that because there are some that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| like 20% funded and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| I'm not sure how they're ever going to get out of that hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| you know some big places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| but again the pension does skew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| that number so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| if we were to take the unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| liability portion off that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| drop considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| actually paying more for the unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| liability than we are paying for the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3727)|
| 1:02:15| I'm getting the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| I just wanted to add one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| going through my notes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| at risk of bringing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| up again the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| the Coliseum auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| and Chihuly Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| my point earlier is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| operating subsidy that the city does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| provide has decreased every year and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| found my notes again on this so for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| example the Knoxville Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| we're requesting $74,058| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| we requested in 15-16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| and that's a direct result of course of improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| operations and improving efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| for the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| auditorium last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| we had or this year we are requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| $1,092,910| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| $372,559| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| last year and then for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Chihuly Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| the operating subsidy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| $847,544| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| which is $101,313| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| less than previous year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| so in summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| it's about $548,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| less of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| budget that's going to support these particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| facilities. On page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| 8 there's a reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| 2.25% increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| over the prior year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| and I assume that's mostly metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| parking meters and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| garages I don't know. Which page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| are you on council? Page 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| under enterprise funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| looks like the whole group is up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| 2.25% right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| something different? The whole group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| is up 2.25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| metro parking is up to 44%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| the convention center is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| down 1.3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| that includes a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| so we can break down that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| mass transit is down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| municipal golf course is actually down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| but that's only because their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| revenues are down so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| public assembly facilities is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| up a little bit. Now again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| what numbers, there's a lot of numbers floating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| around so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I will probably have slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| different numbers than Christy has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| because I'm including some things that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| doesn't include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| I did get the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| the main point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| the contribution is still down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| and it's down significantly on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| convention center and it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| it's probably about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| actually on Coliseum and Chill High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| but again I think you're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| some massive improvements in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| so I think going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| we hope that that will actually go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| yeah it will continue to go down I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| yeah no this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| fantastic news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| sounds like the changes in the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| center were due to just more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| bookings. Were the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| the savings in the Coliseum was that due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| to the privatization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| primarily or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| well I think we will have some savings in staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| there's no doubt about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| because we're paying a professional management company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| to manage the facility now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| we will not have staff and overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| the people who did want to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| can you speak into the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| the people who did want to move to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| there's some people who had some pension benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| obviously at the Coliseum Auditorium that wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| to maintain those benefits so we've been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| identify places where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| they could make a transfer into as an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| to the city but we had a lot of people who also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| chose to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| in a new contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| situation whoever that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| that's selected of course we know right now SMG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| is the only one who has bid and we're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| negotiations with them at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| in time but I think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| some of that is a result of less overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| at that facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| some of that same scenario at Chilhowee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| and it was more a matter of looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| at what we had as far as our organizational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| chart at both of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| and determining what positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| did we need. There's some positions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| really we didn't need going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| in the future with a professional management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| company coming in. Yeah great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| thank you. Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| I assume that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| now have two groups of facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| under one management they can share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| maintenance folks or specialty folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| like HVAC or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| it's already worked that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| it's been really good we've been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| share equipment we've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| been able to share chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| you've been able to share a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| of things the other really interesting piece here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| is that now SMG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| National is able to see all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| our bookings so if they have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| that they are working with to book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| they now see that the Knoxville Tennessee location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| also is a host venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| and can work with them. So it's better marketing too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| It's better marketing as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| we're going to have more and more announcements about some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| things that are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| at the Coliseum Auditorium so it gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| a national platform that we did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| before. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4038)|

| 1:07:32| or I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| you know you can wave me off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4054)|

| 1:07:38| questions you want to ask Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4060)|

| 1:07:44| interesting and you and I touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| on that a few weeks ago let's go back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| page where the revenues that come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| city and how that breaks down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| I forget where that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| I'm just getting ready to ask the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| The pie graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| the charts and graphs in color that's what I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Simple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| that really appeal to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| What changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| I don't know what changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| What page is that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| 41| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| Let's talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| at the very top there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| color chart and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| size of the pie and that's property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| This is general fund only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| I think there's some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| to be said about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Property taxes represent about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| 47% of the total revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| of the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Local sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| are about 19%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| About 8% other taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| are about 11%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| You get to add local sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| and state sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| State shared sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| are another 7% that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| considered intergovernmental revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| I want to talk about some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| The one thing that we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| that is property tax growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| we're still having property tax growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| but our growth in property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| are less than our overall growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| in expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Now what we have seen is we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| some increases in KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| We've had some increases in local sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| We had some increases in state shared sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| and you know our other taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| are fairly constant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| What that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| if you kind of just look at the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| is property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| don't typically change a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| from year to year unless you change the rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| you hope to capture growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| but they're a fairly stable revenue source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| What we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| is that the city is becoming less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| and less dependent on property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| and more dependent upon the other type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| Those taxes are much more cyclical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| so if you kind of look ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| what you think is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| we're going to be more exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| to just economic cycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| I mean we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| some good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| for example fuel costs are down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| fuel costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| they're creeping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| but they're still way down from where year goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| What that provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| is that provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| basically people with more discretionary income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| that they could go spend on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| that they weren't spending on fuel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| and we've probably seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| in local sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| in our state shared sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| where people are spending more on discretionary items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| but if you were to just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| follow that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| then what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| is you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| if gas prices go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| and wages don't go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| you know accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| is discretionary income will fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| again it's more of a cyclical kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| and we start seeing more of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| because we are becoming less and less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| we're still majorly dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| on property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| but what is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| section of the pie shrinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| you're more exposed to volatility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| where is the 4.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| halls tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| other governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| other governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| and we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| again I'm not sure what the governor is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| I haven't talked to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| so I don't know whether he's going to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| and let it go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| but we have budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| 4.9 million in recurring revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| from the hall income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| if the cut goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| obviously we'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| an initial cut in what we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| over the last few years we've had some pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| good years last year we were around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| I want to say 8.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| we will see a cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| the other thing that could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| and again I know I've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| with council member Saunders and I've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| with other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| is what you may see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| is you may see people start to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| the tax game so for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| if I can defer their taxable income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| for another year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| they may say well my taxes will be lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| and if I can afford to defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| then I can start deferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| S-corp distributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| you can time those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| a lot of things you can't time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| for example on S-corp distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| you may be able to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| defer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| if you defer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| you can get these ratcheting effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| and that impact is actually more than what you expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| right now it's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| a 17% cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| but if people start deferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| that 17% cut can turn into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| a 30, 35, 50% cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| in a hurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| just because they want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| well I know my tax rates are going down next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| so I'm going to try and defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| as much as I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| and pay a lower tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| so again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| that rate is what we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| just by that legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| we have seen that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| revenue now becomes a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| I mean it's already volatile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| you can see that we can go from 3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| to 12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| to 9 million to 8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| it's all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| the volatility in that revenue I think is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| given how volatile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| it was I think you can start seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| even wider swings on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| there's some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| impacts that I think you will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I know we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| the city is in good shape financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| we talked about our bond ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I threw out something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| we'd like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| all AAA's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| with the change in the hall tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| I do not see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| any upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| either at the city's level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| or at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| because what you've done is you've now taken away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| a significant revenue source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| now that doesn't mean we're going to get downgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| immediately I don't think we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| I don't think the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| is going to get downgraded immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| but in 2-3 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| again unless the economy grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| at some extraordinary rates I think people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| will start looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| we're going to start looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| okay do they change the outlook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| from a stable to a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| or a positive to stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| that's generally the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| phase 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| and a downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| and you can start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| if those things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| and I can see scenarios where that does happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| hoping for upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| people are now going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| what do I do to avoid downgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| in those markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| and again there are a lot of unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| it has an immediate impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| on us there are some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| scenarios that I can envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| that are significantly dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| again that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| that has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| big impact on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| is that 2% of revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| is that 2 or 3% of revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| out of that 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| the hall income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| is the biggest portion of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| so that probably is about 2-3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| 4.95 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| 2.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Jim's always going to give the negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| so I've got to say something positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| we also still are experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| the highest bond rating we've ever experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| our forecast looks good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| we do not expect a change in our bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Jim's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| if this became an issue later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| for everybody it could affect the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| and everybody else across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| but the most that I think we could ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| foresee is in changing a forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| all of our forecasts have been positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| there could be an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| for a forecast to change but we are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| having the highest bond rating we've ever had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| and as Jim said we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| very healthy financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| and I was just looking at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| we were scheduled to start at 945| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| and probably there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| a break before that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| I just wanted to interject that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| I don't want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I don't think we're going to see any immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| change in bond ratings but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| if you look out 4 or 5 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| that's 3 to 4 to 5 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| that's where you could start seeing some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| so I don't want to immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| put the kibosh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| and we are at the highest bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| that we've ever had and I don't see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| changing here in the immediate future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| what about the rainy day fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| you're going to ask me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| how much do we have in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| I will tell you right now that finance people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| we call it rainy day funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| our fund balance again last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| we were at around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| 72 to 73 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| again I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| where we're going to be at the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| I think we're going to be close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| again a lot of it is going to depend on where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| income tax comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| the income tax comes in right on target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| we could actually have a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| in our bond balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| but again I think we're going to be close one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| now if all income tax comes at 12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| we'll see a gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| if it goes down to 2 we'll definitely see a loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| I don't think it's going down to 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| but I don't know where it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| we are above our levels set for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| we have a 20% threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| that says we will set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| to provide for cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| if you look at that that's well over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| 40 million we have some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| that we have to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| but we're over and above that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| we're probably going to be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| 70ish range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| on fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| we'll take a 5 minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| while you get the next group ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| you're on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| alright we are going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| with the director of community relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Ms. Avis Reed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4722)|

| 1:18:56| director a whole 3 months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4736)|

| 1:20:54| council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4854)|

| 1:20:59| can you tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| there is a proposal the mayor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| to start funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4863)|

| 1:21:11| is that in your budget or some other budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| the mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4877)|

| 1:21:23| anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| I guess I should ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| you mentioned that Clarence Bond was hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| does that mean you have more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| four positions or did he replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| someone who stepped out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| he replaced me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| I replaced Clarence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| I replaced Tank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| so you are stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| at four positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4905)|

| 1:21:53| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I appreciate the opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| to you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| policy and redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| first I would like to set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| good ground rules to make this useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| we could have everybody come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| and give a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| presentation about everything that is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| I tend to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| that is not necessarily the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| what I have asked folks to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| is to have the main spokesperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| for many of these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| and get up with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| there, give a couple minute overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| no more than that and then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| everybody available for questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| I think that would probably be a better use of everybody's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| I think before we get into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I wanted a couple things to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| up on the vision part of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| which sometimes when we are sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| digging around in the weeds we may miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| when Mr. York was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| some of the numbers incoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| he mentioned the TDZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Tourist Development Zone funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| that is what I guess in my previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| life you would label as an unobtrusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| measure of an awful lot of things that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| on in the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| which is really, CBID really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| what that is, is the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| gives its share of the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| not just ours, but its share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| comes back to us to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| to go directly to retire the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| debt, if those dollars didn't come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| back, we'd have to pay them ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| so the direct dollars to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| that frees up other dollars to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| in 2006, and the way it's figured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| and Jim could, if you're interested, could give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| all the gory details, but it has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| with growth in the CBID that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| exceeds the rate of growth outside the CBD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| in the entire county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| we got a grand total of zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| from that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| down this then, Market Square Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| was just coming on, none of our historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| buildings were yet occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5027)|

| 1:23:51| very much fewer of the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| were here, all the things we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| that council has been supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| and supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5037)|

| 1:24:01| added up to, since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| the four million this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5043)|

| 1:24:11| over 30 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5053)|

| 1:24:17| money coming in directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5057)|

| 1:24:51| probably now by close to 175| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| or more million, since we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| that, we've got this money coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| in from the state, not counting, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| mirrors an increase in our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| sales taxes too, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| all of the, I mean we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| could talk about parables to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| to make points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| if you wanted to, I think one good parable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| to make a point is the talents, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| invested a lot of money, we've deferred some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| income, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| think about the cost of garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| and all the other direct costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| that money is, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| very well, a lot of it could well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| be accounted for just in this, not to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| the money that we'll be getting in later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| so, the reason I say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| is the departments they're going to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| have an awful lot to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5133)|

| 1:25:43| proactive in all these projects, so I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| thank council for your support in having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5145)|

| 1:26:17| as I think was pointed out, the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| for the convention center to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| for itself, but to be part of the package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5181)|

| 1:26:39| to these successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| With that, not too subtle sales pitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| unless there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5203)|

| 1:28:02| exercise for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5282)|

| 1:29:46| Kathleen Gibby and Tasha Harris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Kathleen for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| was the communications person for Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| and she kind of wanted to broaden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| her scope a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| and so we were happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| bring her formally into the communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| department and now she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| direct responsibility for all of the public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| departments and Tasha| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Harris similarly is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| delegated to several departments including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| community relations, community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| and several more and by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| that kind of system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Tasha and Kathleen are actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| to a lot of these staff meetings and listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| to what's going on in the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| and they are much more able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| generate ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| about well, you guys are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| like the engineering department for example is doing all sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| of cool stuff, they don't always think to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| tell people about it because it's just part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| their daily job, so now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| we're able to communicate a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| about everything that goes on in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| every day and we find that people really want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| hear those things, you know, they're driving down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| and they see some orange cones, they want to know what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| there and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| we're able to provide a lot more of just that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| of day-to-day ongoing conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| the one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| function I'll mention is that during the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| session every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| I help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| serve as a liaison with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| lobbyists in Nashville and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| local legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| and some years that is a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| consuming task than others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| this year in particular that took up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| a lot of time for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| and so now we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| all breathe a little bit easier at least for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| the next six months or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| that's pretty much all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| I have to say, does anybody have any questions about anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| Jesse, first of all I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| to thank you and Eric especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| for help that you've given me this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| on some of the introduction speeches and that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| of thing. Absolutely, we're always happy to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| any of you with anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| It was a great help and I appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I just had a question, your increase in expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Can you speak into the microphone please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Your increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| in expenses, what was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| primarily? I think that mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| reflects Kathleen Gibby's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| salary line being moved from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Parks and Recreation to Communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| so that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| it's a lateral move within the city as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| it made our department line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| go up but her position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| is essentially moved out of Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| and into Communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| but she was already a public information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| specialist so her job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| hasn't changed, her title hasn't changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| we just moved her into Communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| and gave her some more responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| essentially. The one new request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| that we have is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| a small allocation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I think $8,000 or $9,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| we want to contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| with a social media archiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=5554)|
