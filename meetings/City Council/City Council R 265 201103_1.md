| 2:10:20| beloved by so many people, um, leave and change, and a lot of public meetings, some of them standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| room only to talk about what the site would be in the future, and a lot of uncertainty around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| And, uh, you know, there are folks who have great nostalgia for this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| and, um, I appreciate, uh, Hillwood working with the community. I really want to say that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| appreciate Kevin Murphy and Ronnie Collins for helping to organize the meeting. Um, also, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7843)|
| 2:10:50| to thank, uh, Debbie Sharp for organizing that as well. Um, Mr. Nelson, uh, was very open and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| receptive to the feedback from the community there. Um, every, you know, they've addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| in the speaking comments before, uh, things about lighting and, uh, noise, uh, the truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| traffic and different traffic concerns were all addressed. And, honestly, um, the, the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| I'm, I made it pretty clear that the apartments that are up there that's housing, it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| an investment property, it's housing for 250 families, and I appreciate Mr. Brown has a nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7878)|
| 2:11:25| property up there, and a lot of people call that home, and I appreciate Hillwood for considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| the concerns of them and making sure that they're going to be good neighbors. Um, in addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| being good neighbors and revitalizing the site, they're bringing jobs to our community. But, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| you know, making this a new, uh, project in the 4th District and kind of a really prominent site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7899)|
| 2:11:46| there next to the interstate, um, I've had, uh, property owners surrounding the ring road reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| out to me telling me they're in support of it because, again, this is in front of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| businesses, and this has been a long few hard years for them waiting to know the unknown of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| what's coming. So, I'm really appreciative for their third rendition, um, that Hillwood came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| back with, um, with their client. And, uh, looking forward to this next chapter for the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| Knoxville, and, uh, I also want to say in advance I appreciate their commitment to transit. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| spoken with Hillwood about that as well, um, and I know the conversations, Isaac Thorne has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| been in conversation with them, so I thank Mr. Lawler for those conversations in advance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| This is, um, a really important thing for Knoxville to have these jobs on a transit line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| in such high number right there near a lot of housing as well, um, and near good transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| options. So, I appreciate that and look forward to hearing more from you guys, and I'll, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| I hope, uh, the other council members were able to attend the webinar that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| oh, it's been a few weeks now prior to the Planning Commission, um, but I'll let you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| answer your questions, and I just want to say thank you to everybody for all the time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| effort you've put into this project so far. Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7980)|
| 2:13:07| Any, uh, further questions or discussion? Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| Yes, I would just echo some of the comments that Ms. Ryder said about transit. A lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7991)|
| 2:13:19| feedback about this project I got, uh, was concerns about increased traffic or, or, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7999)|
| 2:13:26| that whole, um, road configuration over there as well that, um, hopefully will be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| at some point. But the, um, the interest in, in encouraging words that Mr. Lawler in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8012)|
| 2:13:40| said about CAP's involvement in trying to integrate facilities like this into the larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8020)|
| 2:13:48| uh, transportation system we have is a, a step in the right direction, uh, for the city, and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| and I was glad to hear those, those concerns, uh, alleviated somewhat. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| Um, I had a question for perhaps Mr. Mullins, but, um, in the new designs, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8046)|
| 2:14:16| am trying to get a sense of how many, uh, loading docks are there under this new plan versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8056)|
| 2:14:23| first plan? Mr. Mullins? You have, um, is Mr. Mullins still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8063)|
| 2:14:33| Yeah, uh, can you hear me now? Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| All right. Um, there, it depends on whether you're talking about the loading docks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8076)|
| 2:14:43| four-axle vehicles or the loading docks for the, uh, the tractor trailers. The, the tractor trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8083)|
| 2:14:50| access is just there to the south, and I haven't counted them, but it looks like a dozen or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| along the, uh, the southern border of that, uh, of the building. And, and that's going to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8097)|
| 2:15:05| only, uh, the only tractor trailer, uh, access to the facility is, is along that southern end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8105)|
| 2:15:13| which, you know, again, is, is further away from the residential neighborhood and, and, and keeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| the access onto Mall Road, which I think is the, the best way to try to avoid the more congested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8118)|
| 2:15:25| intersections and, and businesses to the east of the property. Uh, exactly how many of the, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| the four-axle, I'm not exactly sure. I don't think that's completely depicted here on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| on this plan. That, that may be something that we're still working out, uh, in the design aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| of this. We have a guesstimate of, of how much it might, how much space along this design it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8141)|
| 2:15:50| might take up? Uh, um, no more than what the plan shows. We, we have some early, uh, uh, traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8150)|
| 2:16:00| estimates as far as the, the number of, of vehicles and trips. We're still synthesizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| that and we can probably get that to you in, in, in a more complete form prior to second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| on this. Uh, we, we had some information come in late today that we're still, we're still looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| at. Uh, but, uh, I think it's going to be fair to say that the traffic impact for this, uh, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| the tractor trailers and any other vehicles, employee vehicles or, or four-axle delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| vehicles are, is going to be significantly less than what the mall was generating when it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| uh, fully operational. Thank you. Go ahead. Question for planning staff, but if Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8194)|
| 2:16:43| Ryder has a question for Mr. Mullen. I just wanted to let him go. I wanted to see if Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8203)|
| 2:16:52| Nelson could clarify Ms., uh, Councilwoman Parker's, uh, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8212)|
| 2:17:00| Sure. Can you see? Did you not hear me? I just said I wondered if Mr. Nelson is still on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| call. Oh, Mr. Nelson. And he could more specifically answer Councilwoman Parker's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| Right. And I did just, just get unmuted. Um, so there were a few iterations, so I'm not positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| if I'm looking, which, which of the prior iterations I'm looking at, but we, we eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| the majority of the truck docking areas. Um, it was at one point, um, about 95 truck docking spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8245)|
| 2:17:35| and it's now down to about 18. Thank you. That's helpful. Um, so, uh, a question for City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8255)|
| 2:17:49| Administration. Um, some of the concerns that were raised to me from community members, um, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8269)|
| 2:17:59| how does, um, um, you know, how did this, uh, development fit in with our goals of lowering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8279)|
| 2:18:14| carbon emissions? And if we are to change the zoning of an area, um, in order for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8294)|
| 2:18:25| a business like this, um, um, is there a plan by the City, um, to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8305)|
| 2:18:36| um, to acknowledge that this could make it more difficult for us to meet our carbon emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8316)|
| 2:18:45| goals? Uh, thank you, Ms. Parker. Ms. Gill, you look like you're ready to answer that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| so I'll go ahead and let you speak. Sure. Good, good evening, Council. Um, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8331)|
| 2:18:57| Councilwoman Parker, for this question. And it is something that, you know, obviously, we, we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| our goals seriously and have done some analysis within our Sustainability Department, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8341)|
| 2:19:09| Brian Blackman, um, has looked at this project in terms of its impact for carbon emissions relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| to some of the past activity of the mall, especially. Um, so, based on that analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| some of the context that I can provide is that even when we, you know, what I would call be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| very conservative, kind of a worst case scenario, um, we would expect that the emissions from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8366)|
| 2:19:32| especially the traffic, which is the more intensive piece of where carbon emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| would be coming from in this proposed development, that they would be, um, arguably better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| but at worst case, uh, fairly equal to what we saw when the mall was open, um, even as late as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| 2010, for example, um, when there was quite a lot of cars coming in and out, sorry for the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| noise, uh, quite a lot of cars making it out of that site, um, obviously. So, comparing those two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8393)|
| 2:19:59| um, realities when the mall was open and then also what we're projected to experience under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| this project, um, we don't anticipate a very, um, significant, if at all, uh, overage. The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8404)|
| 2:20:11| perspective, excuse me, the other, the other, uh, perspective that I'll offer here, um, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8411)|
| 2:20:20| you know, this is certainly a development that we want to have in our community and they want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| here. They've expressed an interest in being within the Knoxville community. So, what's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| remember is that, you know, when it comes to climate change, outsourcing of pollution is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| a solution to climate change. So, if they were to relocate in a different community, um, or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| outside of our city limits, um, that certainly that would not benefit our goals of reducing carbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| emissions and addressing climate change. And I apologize for the background noise. We've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| peaceful angel the entirety of council until just moments ago. That's okay. It goes to show that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8450)|
| 2:20:57| eyes are on the future, uh, for our children and our climate's future, Earth's future, too. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| this, uh, Ms. Parker, does that address, uh, your questions? Yes, it does, and I appreciate that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8463)|
| 2:21:11| city has done an analysis. I would push back and say that, you know, moving forward, we can't compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8471)|
| 2:21:18| to uses from 10 years ago if we're going to lower our emissions from where they are today. We are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8478)|
| 2:21:25| trying to lower our emissions from where they were when we had an active East Town Mall. Um, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8485)|
| 2:21:31| just, I wanted to raise that issue because I think it's important that we stay committed to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| goals, um, and that they remain a priority and that we have to keep them in mind, um, um, both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8497)|
| 2:21:45| when, you know, um, both in terms of the administration's work, but also when things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8505)|
| 2:21:53| can be forced for zoning decisions and otherwise. We must keep those climate goals in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| Thank you, Council Member Parker. Vice Mayor McKenzie and then Council Member Tomlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| Okay. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to, uh, say that I'm very excited about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| um, uh, more importantly because of the amount of jobs that it's going to bring into our city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| especially into our community. Uh, the wages are higher than what we normally see in this area. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8537)|
| 2:22:27| knowing that we have a community, an African-American, um, population, uh, has a poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8547)|

| 2:22:40| uh, Hillwood Enterprises will look at job fairs, career fairs, maybe working with the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8560)|
| 2:22:47| and some other organizations that can help coordinate, uh, and make sure that people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| aware of the opportunities and be able to help, uh, in providing the workforce that you need in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| this area. Uh, the proximity being on the bus line is also very encouraging, uh, and I just, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| again, I'm very excited to have, uh, this type of development with this amount of jobs, uh, being in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8584)|
| 2:23:12| this, this close in our community. And so, um, it's kind of funny, so I'm kind of dating myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| but I actually lived in the apartments behind East Elmont when they were first, first built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| So, I do understand traffic, uh, understand, especially when the mall was booming around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| the holidays. And so, you know, hopefully there will be some, um, and also understand the carbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| emission, uh, concerns as well. So, hopefully we will see shifts of people that will carpool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| that there will be some different types of transportation modes that people will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| advantage of, uh, as well. And again, and I also want to, uh, thank the community for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8624)|
| 2:23:51| you know, their patience, uh, their feedback as well regarding this project, and know that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| the greater good that it will be able to help change lives and families' lives with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| types of jobs. So, just wanted to share that. Thank you, and I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| Yes, I had one more question, kind of on the sustainability lines. This project, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| will require the demolition of the old mall, uh, structure, and I was just wondering what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8655)|
| 2:24:22| kind of options there were as far as how to dispose of that material. Can any of it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| recycled, or, um, where would it go? Uh, if anyone can answer that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| Uh, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Mullins, if you all, do you have, uh, some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| um, some knowledge you can share with us on this question? Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| you just unmuted yourself, I think. I did, and we're still looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| obviously. I mean, we will look to recycle as much of it as we can. Uh, how much of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8692)|
| 2:24:59| at this point, in this early stage, I don't think we've studied it enough to really commit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8699)|
| 2:25:04| exactly what that's going to look like. That's certainly something that we are, uh, cognizant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| of, and concerned with, as well. I mean, you know, when we demolish the entire, the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8710)|
| 2:25:18| then, you know, we're hoping to do that in early 2021 with our timetable, and we'll look at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| can be recycled, what can be, um, potentially repurposed, and, you know, meet all the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| quality requirements, and then the requirements the city's going to have on us, and minimizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| the impact to the, uh, the neighborhood. So, I wish I had a more specific answer for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| Councilman, uh, Thomas, but at this stage, I know we've, we've talked about trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| recycle as much of it as we can, but exactly what that's going to look like, we don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| I understand, and I understand, uh, your candid answer on that. Uh, just, I would encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| to look for all opportunities, and try to, try to salvage as much of it as you can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| and minimize waste, and, uh, all the things that we're looking for in many different areas is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| to try to make things more sustainable. Thank you. Certainly. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| Thomas. Councilmember Singh. Thank you, Mayor. Um, if Kent Minolta is still on the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| I had a conversation with him earlier today, and he brought up some really good points about, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| planning commission and being on the same page as the sustainability, uh, piece of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8788)|
| 2:26:36| for them to know when they make the decisions to keep that in mind. So, he brought that up. If he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| still on the line, I'd love to hear what he said. Mr. Minolta, are you still on the line to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| this question? Mayor, I'm not sure he was ever on the line. Oh. Okay. He signed up, but he doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8805)|
| 2:26:53| appear in the pool of speakers. Okay. He was just concerned that when planning was, uh, looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| this, that they didn't take sustainability, uh, into account. I think that Aaron Gale took care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| of that, and everybody spoke to each other, but from, um, now on, it's something that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| department needs to work on together and kind of be on the same page. I think we ended up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| but it'd be good to start there, too. That's all. Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=8836)|

| 2:30:14| Next is public forum. We have three people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| The first person is Michelle Bradford. Ms. Bradford, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9017)|
| 2:30:25| Yes. Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Yeah. Ms. Bradford, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| Okay. Michelle Bradford, 7310 Bennington Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9032)|
| 2:30:40| Um, so I am calling to discuss the 5G rollout within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9040)|
| 2:30:51| It's hard to decide what parts to share with five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| I would love to speak with any of you more in person other than this five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| Um, should I leave my email for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| Or how would I try to go about talking further past the five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| Um, well, um, yeah, you can send me an...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| If you want to email me, you can send it to mayor at knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| Okay. Um, so I will just share a basic introduction to 5G real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| It is not, it doesn't stand for five gigahertz Wi-Fi upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| It stands for the fifth generation wireless technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| which uses frequencies that go above 70 gigahertz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| And it uses a different type of antenna called phase-array antennas that are beam forming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| So human exposure guidelines for microwave radiation used by the FCC are 25 years old now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9107)|
| 2:31:56| And they address only thermal impacts and not biological impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| meaning they only measure when it causes heating to the body and not the cellular impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9122)|
| 2:32:10| And the cellular, the biological impacts have now been firmly established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9130)|
| 2:32:16| The way that, the way the telecom industry makes it appear safe when they do their studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| they remove the modulation, which is the data added to the frequencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| And when independent studies are done, they do a real life type study that includes that modulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| that is sent in real life. And it shows, it's just a huge amount of studies I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9154)|
| 2:32:42| love to share with you all that show biological harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| And over the past 25 years, a vast amount of this science has emerged showing significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9165)|
| 2:32:53| biological impacts from exposure to microwave radiation, including clear evidence of cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| DNA damage, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, reproductive effects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9178)|

| 2:33:30| are headaches, nausea, inability to concentrate, chronic fatigue, nosebleeds, irritability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9210)|

| 2:33:45| infection because it also just lowers the immune system. And anyone with any kind of heavy metal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9225)|

| 2:33:57| inside of a microwave oven. It's kind of similar. If there's any heavy metal toxicity inside of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9237)|

| 2:34:08| more harm. So basically, freedom of choice, you know, has been a fundamental American value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9248)|

| 2:34:48| we're also hoping to somehow halt any further rollout in Knoxville. There are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9288)|
| 2:34:56| 15 of the 4G LTE antennas at close proximity. The closer it is to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9296)|

| 2:35:06| Okay. And there are 10 of the 5G small cells currently in Knoxville, and I'm hoping to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9306)|

| 2:35:59| the meeting to reference something that the mayor made in her report, which was the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| unfortunate and offensive incident, I guess, of blackface on social media by a KPD officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| which I was not aware of. But I do want to address the issue of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| But I want to reference that for a minute just to say, am I understanding correctly that that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| not a resident of Knoxville complaint so that that would not have gone through park? If that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| the case, I would still really encourage KPD to use the public forum of park to share information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9388)|
| 2:36:37| about that incident and to make sure that park board members and staff have access to any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9397)|
| 2:36:44| the information that's going to be learned about that incident because it is very troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| I want to ask the city council to really ask for an update sooner rather than later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| on the new program that KPD has about having a social worker ride along with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9416)|
| 2:37:03| when they go to meet some community crisis needs. I'm working with a group of Knoxville residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9423)|
| 2:37:10| who are very interested in having something that is crisis mobility outside of local law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9430)|
| 2:37:20| enforcement. So the other thing I would encourage is to remind city council that our understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| is that the program that was allocated $98,000, I believe, for a social worker salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| to put in this pilot program with KPD was just that, a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| So we're hoping that this program is not being seen as something that's become ingrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| just because that amount of money has been put into the KPD budget for this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| So we really would ask city council to ask KPD for an update on that program sooner rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9467)|
| 2:37:54| later. One of our members, Alex Riffwald, did receive a response from council member Tommy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9474)|
| 2:38:02| Smith, and we really appreciate council member Smith's getting back to her. And as far as he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| told her, his understanding, if I'm not misquoting you, council member Smith, was that a social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| worker had been hired, and that person has started training and doing ride alongs. And what council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| member Smith said and what he said to Ms. Riffwald was that his understanding also was that council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| was going to be getting an update on that soon. That did not obviously happen tonight. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| would really encourage close monitoring of this program by city council and a quick update on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9508)|
| 2:38:35| in case something wants to be changed for the future, especially given the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| that was allocated to the program. If reallocation needs to be made for the future, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9519)|
| 2:38:45| encourage to be done in the next fiscal year. So just want to ask for an update on that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Thank you so much. Next person signed up to speak is David Hayes. Mr. Hayes, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9531)|
| 2:38:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9539)|

| 2:39:17| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| Yes, we can. If you could start by saying your name and address for the record, and you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Avenue. And I'd like to first start off by saying I support everything that Dr. Conley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9562)|
| 2:39:28| mentioned before, all the points she was making and what she was asking as far as the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| on that program. And also, you know, the point of, you know, that program being a pilot and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9573)|
| 2:39:39| not something that we want to see becoming entrenched. So yeah, I hope you will follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| up on that request. And then when I come to you all to say basically today is just, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9583)|
| 2:39:49| know, just to stand for something, honestly, many of you all were elected, because people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9589)|
| 2:39:54| viewed it all stood for something positive. So I'm asking y'all to actually make come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| through on that commitment you all made to people who voted for y'all into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| right? So I'm asking you to stand for communities and democracy. So changing zones and working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9602)|
| 2:40:08| class neighborhoods in favor of businesses and industry, with little regard to the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| is not democratic, with no requirement of developers to prove that they surveyed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| worked with the community in the creation of plans and no requirement of developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| to stay true to those plans they made with the community. We have no instance of democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9621)|
| 2:40:26| in this system. It's just a matter of how connected you are and if the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| would go in your favor. Nothing systemic, no safeguards for our community, right? There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| shouldn't be the option of blight or unaccountable development. The community should be driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| the remediation of the blight and development. So please stand for communities and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9639)|
| 2:40:45| stand for communities and democracy, not developers. Furthermore, stand for workers' rights, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9645)|
| 2:40:52| cat workers' rights. So cat bus workers are hardworking folks. We all agree that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| So they don't deserve to have dramatic shifts in their lives. They don't deserve to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| a dramatic shift in their life in order to fit into a new unnecessarily limited schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| And that's going on right now. So the city has committed to pay cat's bills during COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9669)|
| 2:41:14| if I'm not mistaken. So, and we know that cat's actually doing pretty well financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| especially related to, especially when you compare it to other public institutions, cat's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| doing all right. So they shouldn't have to be unnecessarily limiting their hours of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| and negatively impacting the lives of workers for fake savings, right? We should actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| have workers actually have power and what's going on there and not just have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| unjust and undemocratic rules being made over their heads. So I want you all to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| cat bus workers being treated well and being treated with dignity. Furthermore, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9704)|

| 2:42:00| and give the full support of the city budget behind it. Not just stay on the sidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9720)|
| 2:42:05| but show some leadership. All of you all, we need, we need to see that support for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9725)|

| 2:42:14| stand up for communities being safe from police violence, racism, poverty, and injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| There was a whole uprising this year, a whole uprising in response to police violence and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9739)|

| 2:43:05| to give it more power. Even, even if it's just the power comes from what the mayor says and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| necessarily what's in the charter at this point, right? We haven't seen any, any, any bold new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9789)|

| 2:43:25| just we will wait and see, we need to see some leadership and somebody saying that they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| punished and even fired if they have a history of complaints. If they have a history of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=9809)|
