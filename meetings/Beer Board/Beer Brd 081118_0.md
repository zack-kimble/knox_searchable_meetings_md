| 0:07:01| Mr. Chairman, I note that we have some administrative beer hearings and also, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| a presentation or at least a discussion about an issue at the request of Council Member Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| later on in our agenda, so I would just request that this be moved to the back of our agenda for the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| and maybe one more opportunity to see if they arrive after we've finished our other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| Second motion. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You're welcome, sir. Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| Yes, sir. Consideration tonight, Diamonds Pub 9307, Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| approved subject to final documentation at our August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| and we did get a signature card back, and the owner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| Would you like to come up to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| Yes, ma'am. We wanted to get an extension, if possible, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| We were having problems with the prints. We had to hire an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| In the middle of getting the architect done, the guy got fired, so we had to start all over with another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=484)|
| 0:08:14| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Yes, Tracy Mallory, 9307B, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| How long of an extension do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| I was going to request 90, but I doubt we'll need that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| Will you comment on whether it would be 60 or 90 that you're requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| 60 probably would be way sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| I move that we grant a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Opposed no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you, all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Secondly, we stop 8857 Town and Country Circle, and the owner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=533)|
| 0:09:06| My name is Sudhir Barla, 8857 Town and Country Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| My store is under construction, and I expect to get the CO in the first week of December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| so I'd like to request the extension for two to four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Excuse me, an extension for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Two to four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Two weeks or four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| For four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| I move that we approve an extension of four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| Well, excuse me, it would be until the December beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Opposed no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| The last two items are, one, the farm at 1204 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| You have granted several extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| I don't know of the applicants here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Is an applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| For the farm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I'll address my comments to both the farm and the Happy Holler Diner since they're the same applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| You know, he's been here before, and before last meeting he contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Honestly, I don't know where he is with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| I mean, is there any difficulty in giving him another 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and sending him a certified letter saying he really needs to be here to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=646)|
| 0:10:57| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| Excuse me, to apply to both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Clarifying, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I'll second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Opposed no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| The last item would be an item requested by Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| Chairman Hall, do you want to do that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| or do you want to do the administrative hearing so those folks can go on home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| I'll do the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| If that's all right with Council, I defer the discussion to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=702)|
| 0:11:58| MKs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=718)|
| 0:12:10| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Yes, French Scarborough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| It's 1109 White Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| You're here because you've had several underage sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| and to present us with a plan of what you intend to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| We've had two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Basically, you guys have a copy of the original remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| The additional remedial plan, as a result of this last infraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| is basically to continue doing what we did for the first remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| and also incorporate several other things to make sure this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| One of the big key things we're doing is every bar 10 or every shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| is going to sign a documented policy on each shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| that we're going to keep at the bar by one of our managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| and to review the policy on a daily basis that they sign off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| Second, along with having the current signage that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| we're going to add some additional conspicuous signs internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| to the bartenders to remind them of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| and the consequences of that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Third, we're going to be in our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| especially in a hotel environment, it's extremely serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| when things like this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| and we're going to increase the amount of training we do for different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| at this thing to keep this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Do more scenario-type training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| It's not just as simple as checking an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| I mean, if you have other people joining, somebody you've already checked an ID for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| it's not acceptable to assume that just because they're with that party of age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| that they are of age also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| And also we have, in our situation, we have people that we hire that are already ABC trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| However, we're not going to take that for granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| or an assumption that they are up to par,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| and we're going to put them through the exact same training that we do new hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| that have just gotten their ABC cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=846)|
| 0:14:16| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Oh, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Yeah, I think partly the wake-up call we got from the recent beer sting says we're not doing things well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| and so I'm going to make a motion to send this to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| I don't hear anything particularly strong there that says we're going to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Councilman Hopelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I know members of this board have expressed the concerns that I'd like to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| and reiterate again tonight, and it's important no matter where it is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| but this is certainly no less sensitive an area with the student population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| the council district that I represent, and there are a lot of problems and a lot of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| both underage drinking and alcohol abuse within the confines of certain establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| and outside those establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| And, of course, you and other proprietors have no control over what happens outside your establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| but you do have control over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| and you have to have control over what happens inside your establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| So I think it's critical that there be some accountability there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Yes, I plan to support the motion to send this to suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| and I'm supporting it for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| First of all, in both instances when our officers came in to check compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| the underage person was not even carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| You know, if there had been a carding and the ID had been misread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| I guess I might be more understanding, but in neither case was the individual carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| And secondly, looking at your plan from April 2007 and your plan from November 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| I don't really see any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| The plan in April 2007 says that you will conduct daily and monthly continuous training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Well, if there were daily and monthly continuous training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| hopefully this unfortunate incident would have happened again in November 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| I plan to support this motion to send to suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=984)|
| 0:16:35| Just an additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| The weakness of this plan is that you're just asking people to really promise to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| There's nothing in the system to keep underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| So that's why I'm also going to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Is it available for comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Obviously, I agree with what you guys are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I mean, this is something that is bigger than just right for wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| We're in an environment, as this gentleman over here said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| about it's not just the bartenders holding them accountable when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| As far as the additional training goes, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| as documented at the hotel, what we did not do is we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| What we daily remind the bartenders to card is what do we do to hold them accountable when they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| And when you have a signature on file on that shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| they understand our policy and the consequences of our policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| which is a zero tolerance at our hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| You know, that's kind of the hard act that we took with them this second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| We've had the license since, I believe, sometime in January of 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| And this is our second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| And we do have a zero tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| And as a general manager, not knowing me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| I would just simply ask you to have confidence that I will rectify in front of you guys this situation to save the embarrassment of the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| save the embarrassment of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| And I will take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| That's all I can comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| I totally agree with what you guys are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Not having been in the industry for 20 years, not ever having this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| obviously it's kind of new ground for me as far as detail remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| But I can tell you that these things are not taken lightly, taken very seriously and from top down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| And having not had much experience with remedial plans, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| I apologize if it wasn't detailed enough to your expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| And I'd much rather go back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| And if this is not sufficient to provide you with additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Because we have the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| We have it documented as far as them going through our individual training, much less having the ABC cards on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| The individual that was in question here, the bartender, was ABC trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| However, this person was hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Usually when we took over the establishment, we did the training in-house on top of the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| This individual already had the ABC card, already trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| We didn't take the same approach as we did with our normal hires that do not have that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| And that's what we're going to do different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Mainly is stress to those type of people that already have that training through the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| That, listen, you know, this is, I understand you have the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| But, you know, we're going to train you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| And we're going to stay on top of you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| And that's something that we didn't do well with this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And the question is to send them to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Is that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| We had eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| They will notify you as to when to appear for suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Apple, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1227)|
| 0:20:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| My name is Deanna Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| It's 8212 Flocks Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| You're here because you've had several underage sales to minors and to present us with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| It's what you tend to do to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We had on the original remedial plan, on both of our violations, my employees did card the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| They just didn't take the time properly to look at the date the way they should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| So my original remedial plan focused on what I could do between them looking at the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| and making that date really stick in their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| We used a documentation system through the server order pads, and I provided you all with a copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| as well as the documentation from the original plan that is still in place at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| And I think that's worked really well table side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Unfortunately, what we found with this recent violation was our bartenders were still operating business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| So on the second plan, the main focus and what's going to make the difference is having the customer remove the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| from the wallet so that the bartender can then take it to a well-lit area, because that's important in our establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| getting it right under one of those spotlights so they can look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| And we're also requiring our bartenders now to also document that birth date, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| to try to give them another opportunity in their head to make it stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| That is the date that's carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| And we are keeping up with those on a shiftly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| My managers are monitoring them, and bartenders that are not found in compliance will not work for us any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| That's the main difference from the plan, because I think the other plan did work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and the dining room would just fail to solve the problem at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| You know, this idea of take the ID out of the wallet and take it someplace to read it, when did you implement that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| After the second infraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| I would just like to compliment you on the details of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Obviously you've taken this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| As you pointed out, in both cases the individuals were carded but mistakes were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Your first plan was detailed, and your second plan is even more detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| And so I'm very hopeful that this will address the plan ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Absolutely will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Any additional comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| I'll call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1395)|
| 0:23:30| Dan Fleming, Vice President of Pilot Corporation here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| Yes, you're here because you've had several underage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| and to present us with a plan of what you intend on doing to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| First of all, we're very --- I apologize for, I'm not sure the last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| but I do remember it extremely well and tried my darndest not to have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| We put a plan together after our first sale at this location, which I believe is in May of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1437)|
| 0:24:06| At that time, Diane, the cashier who was immediately terminated upon this action, did card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| And we did put it into place right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| We went back and said, okay, well, she did card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| She failed to read the ID correctly, failed to punch it into the computer correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| for whatever reason continued on and sold the beer to the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| So we did take an extensive, not just at that unit, but at all of our units in the area in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| under me, which is 38 stores, how to read an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Go back to the basics and say, okay, it says 21 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Take special note and make sure that you're reading it properly and putting it into the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1484)|
| 0:24:54| We stepped up our sting operations, which we perform a minimum of once per month per store at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| And we seemed to improve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| And we thought that we were on our way with the mandatory carding law that's in effect in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1504)|
| 0:25:15| And being able to read the IDs, putting it in properly, we still continued on in our training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| And we also applied, and we're a member of the Knox National Association of Convenience Stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| for the new supervisor level training that they provide and put our managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| and our supervisors through training again to say, okay, just because the law says you have to card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| just because the cash registers have to shoot, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| are there to prevent the mistaken calculation of the date that we do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| and continue to enforce the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| I believe it was in September that we failed this last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| Bill, who was a 62-year-old man who had been working for us for some time, did not card at all, did not ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| I have no explanation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| After that, we again realized that, you know, we've got to go back to the basics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| go through the training steps again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| We implemented a few other things as far as stings from other supervisors and the stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| At that store, we stung the store every week, and every person that was at that store was retrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| through the Knox Techniques of Alcoholic Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| The manager, we felt after almost two weeks later, we let the manager go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| a manager that we've had there for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| We just felt that he was not doing the right thing, not just in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| but to implement and to maintain the standards that we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| Since then, we have stung each employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| We have had them sign off on new training packets as if they were a new cashier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1629)|
| 0:27:17| And also, we have implemented the shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Before you come to work for us, you have to sign off on a statement that talks about what is the legal date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| legal date for that day for both alcohol and tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| And in doing that, I feel like we are continuing to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| I feel like we're 100 percent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| I wish I could give you that assurance, but we're going to try to get up to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| And I think that's about what I've got to offer you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Officer Husk, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Mr. Fleming alluded to the Diane Nelson citation, and he said that she did card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| but the information I have in front of me said she did not card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| She did not card, and she was cited for not carding also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| Do you have something contrary to that, Mr. Fleming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I just got her write-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1696)|
| 0:28:25| We have May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| We were told by Diane that she did card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| I mean, I wasn't there, so, I mean, that's what she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| The information we have is showing that June 15th, 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| Well, I can only tell you what I got on her corrective action form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| It was also filled out by the manager at that store, and the regional manager is here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I've got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| This is our personal sting that we did at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| But on her, when we asked Diane about it, she was immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| She didn't want to lose her job, and she said that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| She said, no, I carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I just thought it was 68 instead of 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Officer Husky just happened to show me the copy of the citation where she was cited for failure to card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1756)|
| 0:29:25| Now, you mentioned an earlier date, a May date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| That's what I've got, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| I've got an internal sting date that we did our own sting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| So on your own documentation, she did card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| But she just didn't calculate the age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| She punched in 1968 instead of 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Can you talk about the punch it in the machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Tell me how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| What's your system on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Well, what you need to do is you need to get the ID in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| You need to examine it to make sure it's a legitimate ID the best you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| actually punch in the date, like let's just say 05-18-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| So it would be whatever date is on the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Then it automatically calculates on the register what 21 would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| And does a list come up, a printout of all the birthdates later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Is there some way to get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| On that register, does the birthdate come out on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| Yes, it's on the electronic journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| And do you all check that to make sure somebody is putting in accurate dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and not always the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Because a lot of time, I mean, being that we card everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| it gets to their point where they, I know you, I've seen you, I've done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| they just put in a quick date to get across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| And that's what our job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| We implement a procedure that we don't just allow them to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| A lot of times they use their own birthdate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| We know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| So we do inspections on a shiftly basis of the journal to make sure the dates are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1864)|
| 0:31:13| Councilwoman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Mr. Fleming, you referenced just now that you card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| And you referenced earlier that under the city law you were required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Officer Husky, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it state of Tennessee law now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| that every purchase of beer for off-premise must be carded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| Yes, ma'am, it is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| So that's statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| And yet in both of these infractions, unfortunately, the individual was not carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| And I guess, you know, no matter how detailed the remediation plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| my concern is that your employees understand that even if they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| or think they know the purchaser, even if it's someone who looks like they might be of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| state law says that you card every person every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| And I'm not seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Well, no, I mean, that's our policy and that's our procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| And if we follow that, whether it's today, whether it's a cadet, whether it's just somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| if it's I walking up beer and they don't card me, they card me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| If they don't card me, they get written up immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| And that's one of the write-ups that we have on Diane that I had in the file here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| But, you know, it isn't just for the beer stangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| It's for every deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I mean, every beer sale has to have follow-up with a date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| When you go in and do your internal stangs, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| you said on this particular employee, Diane, you did an internal sting and she did not card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and yet she was not terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| She did card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| Oh, but she missed the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| She wrote the wrong date in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| And that was documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| She was written up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| All of our employees know that if they fail a beer stang, there's no gray matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| You're fired right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| You do not have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| It's communicated throughout our system very, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| And we take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| I mean, it's not just for the beer stang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| It's for every beer purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Now, Bill, the last guy I did was 62 years old, very responsible man, worked for us for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=1991)|
| 0:33:20| had been carded, had been tested, had passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| I have no reason, I have no excuse for him and would take full blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| He decided for this transaction not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| I think I can bring the journal showing that that night every beer sale he'd had before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| at least the ones we checked, he did card and he had a date on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| But we have video camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| We review with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We go to a great extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| We have training classes minimally every quarter, if not every,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| probably it's more like every eight weeks with the turnover that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| But we definitely, you know, the law is that you get carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Everybody gets carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Mr. Haslam walks in, he gets carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Every purchaser, every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| For every beer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Same with cigarettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| If you're not 27 in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| But if you don't think they look 27, you have to card them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| So it's a dual law that we use at the beginning of every shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| If you come to work for that shift, you have to sign off noting the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| It's a little bit more confusing because one's 18, one's 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| So you want to make sure that they have it in their head so that when that time comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| they make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Mr. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| And you may have addressed this in your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I noted in the correspondence of October 27, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| you say you're going to increase the frequency of your internal beer stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Now, you said from once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Yeah, what we did at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Are you increasing it to, or did I miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Well, at this particular, we do it once a month for every location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and I keep record of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| No matter good times, bad times, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| that's the supervisor's job is to take someone in once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| So you're going to increase from once a month at this store to how many times a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| At this store, we increased it every week, and our intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| and we had a meeting with the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| was that every employee would be stung within a two-month period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| and that they knew that going in, that we could not afford another violation at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| So your plan is to increase to once a week at this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| At this store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| We've already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Got to get every employee at least once every two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| How long do you plan on continuing this increased frequency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| Well, the first six stings, we had very good success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and in the law, as far as the city is concerned, we did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| We didn't do a few other things that we require, like give receipts and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| but we've continued on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| We've assigned a new manager that has 13 years of experience to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| And, I mean, I guess it's up to the supervisor to quit when he feels comfortable that we won't have that problem again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2173)|
| 0:36:25| If someone fails your internal sting, what actions do you take as a company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| You get a write-up the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| The second time, you are suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| The third time, you're terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| You're suspended the second time for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| In that process of action, do you also provide additional training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| We have on a DVD our training, but also we found that the best training is with our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2211)|
| 0:37:01| So our supervisors, as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| they're all through NAC's technique alcohol management supervisor's training on exactly that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| and with a lot of emphasis on how to read an ID, how to read it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2232)|
| 0:37:21| When did you begin to increase frequency of your bird stings at this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| At this store, originally, we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Since this October 3rd of 2008, have you already increased those stings since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| October 3rd, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I might have the date a week or so off as far as, but our first sting was October 2nd after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2256)|
| 0:37:45| And we've continued it every, I'd have to get your records, but every seven days the supervisor gave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| You're still continuing it to this day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| When was the last time you had a sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Well, I think it was last Thursday or Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| How did it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| It went good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| I don't feel as bad about this one as I did about the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| but I still think when you have two citations without carding either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| I think it's worth a motion to send to a suspension revocation hearing, and I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Councilman Palo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| I was going to ask another question, but I think it probably is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I'd just like to tell you I appreciate your thoroughness and all the things you went through in your programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| and I think it's probably one of the most detailed I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| And going in those stores, I think your cash register people are very diligent in their effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2324)|
| 0:38:54| and I don't agree with my colleague on this one, so I'll not be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2334)|
| 0:39:04| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I tend to favor Councilman Becker's motion, you know, neither were carded, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| and also this one is actually the two violations occurred closer in time than the ones on MK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| so that gives me another reason to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| The only thing I'm struggling with is why don't you let people go who you have identified internally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| If they've demonstrated that they are not going to be responsible, why run the risk of keeping them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2378)|
| 0:39:48| If they broke the law on our internal sting, we would immediately let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| But they're not breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| I misheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| The failures that we have had, they have carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| The person they're carding, we do not use a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| We don't feel it's our, that we have that liability and that we can use a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| So we use somebody that's close to 21, under, well, it doesn't matter because everybody needs to be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| But we try to use someone in every case that we have, if they card and they made a mistake punching it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2421)|
| 0:40:30| then we go over it with them and say, okay, you made the mistake, here's what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| And, you know, we don't draw the tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| I mean, if they blatantly just said, you know, here's your beer, get on your way, they're fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2440)|
| 0:40:51| I guess I will ask my question because it has to do with how the stings are, the internal stings are conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Apparently they are not done by employees of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| They're supervised by employees of pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| But they're, I mean, you know, my supervisors have kids that are 22, 23 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| We did run a sting not too long ago with someone that was 58 years old just to have them go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| and let our people know that we were going to run stings so that they did card that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| So, you know, it's not just set up for the trying to prevent the underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| but to make sure that they know the importance of carding every beer purchase that comes through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| I guess it just concerned me that maybe the stings are conducted by people who would be easily identified as conducting a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2500)|
| 0:41:50| But that's not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I mean, our objective is not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Because it seems that you're so successful, you know, when you do it internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| Well, I've never been caught on a beer sting except with a cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| So I'm not saying that it doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| A lot of it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| So I think we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| I mean, I hope right now with the beer that's being sold over the counter is being done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| But, again, I think we're carding everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| But obviously in these two cases we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| And I think it's, if you go to our checkout right now, you'll see that this policy is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| You know, failure to do this will lead to immediate dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| And, again, like I said, it isn't just for someone that's underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| It's for anybody that walks in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| If you're not carded, you're not doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| We don't want you working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| That's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| That's right, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2586)|

| 0:43:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| I'm going to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2595)|

| 0:43:18| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Councilman Holtquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Councilman Coonerty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Councilman Whithell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| So they will be to send it to a suspension and revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| You'll be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Please food mark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Food mark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2629)|
| 0:44:01| My name is Gail Wilder, and the address is 5706 Asheville Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| You're here because you've had several underage sales to minors and to present us with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| It's what you intend to do to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| This employee actually did ask for an ID, but in our system we come to find that you could bypass the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2659)|
| 0:44:28| and this is exactly what this employee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| What we have done is we went back into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| and we've got it set up now to where you cannot bypass the system on putting an ID in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| So we're looking at other ways to try to help and that this won't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| We have the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| She goes through the journal tapes now each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| I'm the general manager, actually, and the manager at the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| she goes through the journal tape and sees what dates that are put in each day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| and like I said, we're trying to do all we can at this location to stop this from being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| because, I mean, we have, I don't know what all y'all have that we sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| but actually, you know, whenever we hire anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| they sign papers that shows that, you know, they have been trained and that they are to ID everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| I mean, it don't matter what age they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| and how many times they come into the location in order to be ID'd every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2719)|
| 0:45:27| Councilman Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| One of the remedial steps that you've outlined in this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| which of these were new since the most recent violation, which was just last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| Have any of these been added since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Or were they all in place prior to that violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| All of them had been in place with the exception of the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| As far as what you're asking, as far as when we hire an employee, when they are hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| and they sign all the papers that they have been, I sent all the papers in, I don't know what you all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| but it shows for that, you know, it tells everything that they are to ID everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| That has been there since the day we opened the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| They do that every single time that an employee is hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| But as far as the cash register, we have just set the cash register up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| to where you can bypass it just since this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So the violation that happened on February 13th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| Thomas Adkins was the one sided, the employee sided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| that did not entail a diversion misusing the cash register, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| He didn't even ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Well, it says here that he did card, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| He did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Well, I wasn't aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I was misinformed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| But what you're saying is that this glitch in the system that allowed them to bypass the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| or the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| But they knew not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| They didn't know about that until the violation that occurred on the third of last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Council Member Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| What was the result of the violation when Mr. Adkins sold to the underage cadet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Well, he had actually just started working there, and he was terminated immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| His liquor liability employment agreement is a little bit confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| because he has signed as both the employee and the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| So I was wondering what exactly the outcome was of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| And what about Ms. Choate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| She is actually, we have not terminated her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| We have written her up, and she will be terminated if it ever happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| She is a very good employee, and she did ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| But she, like, of course, she bypassed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| And we're, you know, I really think I've seen this in the past as far as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| we do have other locations, but I've seen that if you have someone that really shows sympathy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| and feels like that you feel like that you really think that they will learn from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| that they really have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| And I really feel like that she will never not ID again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| And you said that there was the ability to bypass the system when Ms. Choate did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| but that has now been changed in your system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| And so an ID has to be entered every time to make the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| They cannot bypass the system any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| Counselor McVick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| How could they bypass the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Well, basically, when they put in an ID, if they put one in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| it's going to come up in the valid if it's not the right ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| But what she done is she just bypassed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| It just says, you know, yes or no, and she just went no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| and just bypassed it and went on through with the sale instead of putting the date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| An ability before to just say no, no ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| That's changed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| So somebody could still put in a wrong ID, put in their own birthday on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| but you check the tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| You've got that same thing with the birthdays come up, and you're checking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Yes, the manager is, and we're making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Like I said, I'm the general manager, and I'm making sure that this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| You know, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| We have lots of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| and I think you're the first person who ever came up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| and thought your employee didn't ID when they actually did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| That's a good problem to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| I think it's, you know, your employee actually did better than you thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Councilman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Given how close together these two infractions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| both happening in this current calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| normally my inclination would be to send this to suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| I'm not going to make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| because our records indicate that both of your employees did card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| so evidently there was some error in entering the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| But I'm awfully concerned that this be solved at this store and all of your stores ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| and that the system be bulletproof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| that it's not something they can bypass or make up birthdays or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| State law requires, as we said to the previous gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| every sale, every card, every ID, every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| And I want to make sure that's very clear to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| We go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| We go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3047)|
| 0:50:57| John DeLargo's Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3057)|
| 0:51:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| I'll move we postpone to the next regular board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Also, I'd like to request that we send them a certified letter with regards to the next regular board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| and ask them what their intentions are, as we've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| whatever our form letter is, and make sure it's a certified return receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Ms. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Oh, Ms. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Chairman Hall, I had requested that we add to our agenda a discussion relative to the most recent compliance check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| conducted by Officer Husky's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| and he has provided for us a memo that we also received electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| indicating the number of establishments visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| establishments visited and 20 of those 41 sold to the underage cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| Ms. Brunson has a packet that we're going to pass around with kind of some food for thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| and it shows some statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| and I'd like to call Ms. Brunson to the podium to address some of the strategies that have been considered by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| Metropolitan Drug Commission in terms of advocating for changes in the licensing at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| I know Officer Husky, in an email, talked about the vertical ID concept that some states use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| I believe the board of the Metropolitan Drug Commission feels that there may be some problems with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| but let's open up the floor to Ms. Brunson and then have some discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| because I think we're all extremely disappointed in the results of this recent compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| And on that disappointing note, Catherine Brunson with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| 9413 Westland Drive, home address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| As you're getting a handout right now, I'd like to start on a really positive point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| which is about the beginning of 2005, we all, this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| embarked on an underage drinking initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| And our latest youth survey results show that we were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| We have really brought down the 30-day use and the binge drinking use in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| and not by tiny amounts as you see in front of you, significant population level outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| which is what we all really want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| We don't want to see 30 kids in the classroom reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| We want to see it reduced across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| And the Metropolitan Drug Commission didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| and their incredible increase in their compliance efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| You backing up the police department when they do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| and doing due diligence to hear each and every case on an individual case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| and enforce those that need to have some enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| It's multiple efforts that brought about these results that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| A lot of people like to think of prevention as providing information and educating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| and that is an important part of our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| However, I can tell you that no brochure will bring about these kind of population level outcome changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| One of the things that we know from research by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Linguistic Prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| our environments are perfectly engineered to get the results that we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| So when we want to achieve population level changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| we have to look at our environment and what is it that's in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| that's enabling us to see the behaviors that we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| We know that by reducing access and availability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| that is the number one way we can really target our underage drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| and that's what we all did together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| When Officer Husky sent us these disappointing results of last Thursday's compliance check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3311)|
| 0:55:19| where 41, I think they were mostly restaurants, were checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| and we had pretty much a 50% failure rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| 20 failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| That's, I don't think, acceptable by any of our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| I have been coming to the county bear board and the city bear board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| as long as I'm in town, for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| You're getting down to about third grade math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| and I think you are probably about as tired as I am of hearing we calculated wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| You've got to remember a year, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| I mean, one year that if it's in this year or before, not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| I think we need to sit down and talk about what we can do to address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| Senator Tim Burchett passed last year a piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| that would increase the size of the date of birth on the driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| which I think was really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| There are people like me now who have glasses sitting back there that cannot read the exact statistics to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| So I think that was a really, really important measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| I can understand that you can't see it, but calculating wrong when all you need to remember is a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| I'm sorry, that's not acceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| It's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| If you can run a register, I believe you can calculate those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| The vertical license has been brought up, and I'll be honest to say that was a piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| that I brought up in one of my board meetings proposing it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| My concern with that is if they're already really not looking at the driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3418)|
| 0:57:07| which is what I think is happening, it's not we misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| I think what happens is we saw one, and that ends it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| If all you have to do is see one this way, are you going to look at one when it's this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| And does that not make your fake IDs, which is what most underage drinkers are going to use to go get a sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| that much more effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| You're not going to look at it at all, because it was this way instead of this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| So I have concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I understand from a business perspective that would make it easier for my people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| because you just need to look at this instead of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| And I can see how that would actually improve our compliance with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and so I understand that from the police department's perspective that's their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| My goal is to keep reducing these rates of underage sales and underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| And I really fear that would actually go in the wrong direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| because I think you would stop examining the license at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| And I think what we need to look at collaboratively is what is it we need to do to get people to really look at the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| and look at the picture, not just see that you had a license in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| And I'll open that for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| I think it's important, I will say in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| I think we've made some headway along the way in these years by bringing the restaurants and the retailers to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| And I have made some calls to a couple of people that are on the state restaurant association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| and are also local owners here who I know are very willing to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| I don't think this is something you'd decide in a five-second conversation which direction we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| I think it would be prudent for us to bring all parties to the table and really have a good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| and hear from them what their problems are and what might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| I know we're almost out of time, so I want to do three quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I'm really glad of the statistics on the beer stings that you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| It was good to see that this year, even with this recent sting, it's worse than last year, but it's not hugely worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| But it's really headed in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| It's headed in the wrong direction, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| When I first got that memo from Officer Husky, I kind of freaked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| So I was glad to see your statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I have two questions, and given the amount of time we've got, I think these should be yes or no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| One, will requiring restaurants to say you've got to show an ID, do you think that will help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| And I get the feeling you want to say no because it's just, do you see an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| I really feel like that is the problem here, is that we're not really looking at those IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| So I think what we really need to talk about is how do we convey the importance of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| beyond seeing a physical presence of an ID, convey the importance of looking at the picture and looking at the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| And I guess the second question is, does increased punishments, does that make a difference in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| If we say we're going to, you know, longer suspensions and higher fines, will that change things, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| And that actually has come up in County Bear Board yesterday and something that they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| They already charge higher than you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| That's not an opinion issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| I can tell you there is a lot of research on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| and there is a very direct correlation to the wallet cost and the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| And I'll be happy to provide you with that research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Good. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Council Member Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| I wanted to give some credit to Carolyn Ruth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| who was the Youth Action Council representative to the Metropolitan Drug Commission Board last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| and many of you all know she's now the youth representative to Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| And she was the one who was courageous enough to speak up in a boardroom full of adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| about addressing the vertical license issue and brought to our attention that it's the fake IDs that are the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| And that, as Ms. Brinson very clearly explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| if you just make it so that you have to look at vertical or horizontal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| you're taking the brain out of the issue and really exacerbating the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| The Metropolitan Drug Commission is happy to host some kind of gathering with the County Bear Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| and the City Bear Board and maybe some folks from the police department and the restaurant association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| And we'd like to set aside some time, if this board is willing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| to give themselves to that time where we could have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| and explore some of these questions like Mr. Becker brought up in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| Council Member Peeble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| Well, I had wanted to comment that I appreciate very much you explaining the vertical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| and your assessment of the wisdom in that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| And that is just mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| And I understand that. Thank you, Ms. Brinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| I think Ms. Roddy has recommended that we take an opportunity to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| and certainly we can't do that in a couple of seconds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| So I think that Ms. Roddy's suggestion is probably one we need to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| And I would hope that such a workshop or discussion could take place with both county, city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| I think it's very important for us to coordinate our efforts in this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| because I know so much of my district just runs right out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| And, Officer Husky, so much of my district was involved in your report that I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| gee whiz, going to have to buy me a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| But anyway, would appreciate very much you helping us facilitate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| And I'm sure Vice Mayor Brown would be happy to work with you in scheduling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| And the county commission approved that for yesterday, too, that they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| So I appreciate you being willing to take that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I'll contact Ms. Mitchell if that's appropriate to coordinate trying to get some times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| And please feel free to call me at any time in between with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Are there any other business that's come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081118?start=3794)|
