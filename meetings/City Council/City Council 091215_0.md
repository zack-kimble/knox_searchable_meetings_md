| 0:08:21| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| I'd like to move to postpone the whole agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| I've wanted to do that for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| Eight years is my last shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Councilman Hall, you had threatened to do that, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| As much as the Chair would like to do that, he'll deny that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Well, I'm going to ask Vice Mayor Becker to join me around front, and I'm also going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| ask Councilman Hultquist, Councilman Hall, Councilman Frost, Councilwoman Pelow, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Councilman Booker to join us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Can we tell who those people are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=539)|
| 0:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Well, I'll wait until everybody comes around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=558)|
| 0:09:29| After 208 regular Council meetings, numerous called meetings, countless public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=569)|
| 0:09:39| workshops, and others, this is, as Barbara acknowledged in her prayer, the last Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| meeting for five dedicated people who have served our city very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| And I can assure you that being Council, they might pay you as if you don't work full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| but I can assure you these folks work full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I've seen them be at meetings all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| I've seen them answer emails all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| And I can assure you that the folks have, all five of these people have worked incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| hard for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And so, as Mayor, and on behalf of the city of Knoxville, I thought it appropriate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| we take a minute to recognize those folks tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| And I'll turn it over to Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| You want me to keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| I'm going to keep going then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I'm going to start with District 1 and Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| And Councilman Hultquist, it is appropriate to applaud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| Councilman Hultquist has fought hard about, for a lot of things that he cares passionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| about, whether it be new forms of transportation, the South Waterfront, a lot of different issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| that have been things that Joe felt passionate about, he has worked diligently for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| And I think the results show, long after Joe is gone, I think the marks and things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| you've committed yourself to the city I think will be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| So, again, I want to congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| And I'll ask Vice Mayor Becker to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| I have very little to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| When I thought about you, there's the visionary that always came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| And then the other word that I thought about was somebody who has the persistence of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| pit bull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| And I think some of what we've seen happen in South Waterfront, some of the issues you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| keep bringing up, that showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| And on behalf of Council and the administration, we want to give you this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| This is actually your name tag that you've had for the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| And as a certificate, which we're not going to read because it's written by a politician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| and you know how long-winded we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| So, congratulations, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| And as you can tell when she prayed, being a councilwoman has mattered incredibly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| And I say that in the best sense of the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| She has taken this job very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| I can't think of anybody who's attended more meetings, answered more emails, followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| up with more phone calls than Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And she has, I think it's fair to say, has loved this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| And when you love a job, it shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| And it's been reflected in everything she's done through working for the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| in her district and caring about a multitude of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| So, Barbara, we are very grateful for all your work and the way that you've loved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| cared for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| And we're confident you will continue to love and care for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=730)|
| 0:12:22| Barbara, on behalf of council, I want to thank you for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| And thank you for the heart of gold that you bring to this job and show us on a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| basis and give you this with your name and a nice certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| So, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| We actually stole their name tags about two or three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| We were just curious if anybody would notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| And Councilman Hall, I think, is famous for his maybe lack of long-windedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| And there have been a lot of nights that we have been greatly appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| But I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I can think of very few people who have changed the course of a conversation as many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| as Steve has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| He doesn't talk a lot, but when he talks, people tend to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I can think of about four or five times off the top of my head when he's asked a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| or made a point that literally has changed the direction of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And I think in the end, we always went, we ended up at a better place because of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Steve did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| So, Steve, we're very grateful about, I guess it was two and a half years you had a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| serious motorcycle accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| And I know all of council rallied to your side literally there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| A lot of people drove over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| And I know all of us cared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| And when we saw you come back in still wearing that almost full-body brace, I think it said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| a lot about your commitment to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| And we're deeply grateful for everything you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Steve, I'll try and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Steve also, as well as not being known as a talker, Steve and I also sort of had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| political disagreements and some ideological distance between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| And as I thought about this, Steve, one of the things that I remember is all the times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| that you and I were on the same side and how good that felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| And while I could be very self-centered about it, I think the truth is that there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| of wisdom and truth that you brought to all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And I felt much better agreeing with you than when I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| So, thank you for all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| And a plaque with, again, your name tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| District 4, Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| And I think I see both of his boys and his wife back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| I know there's others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| I know Steve's wife is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| And I want to come back to Dr. Pelow before I finish because I see several Pelows here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| But I'm going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I saw Janet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| So, I apologize if I left out somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| But Rob has been, anybody that knows Rob has been someone that knows that he does his homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| he prepares for a meeting, he understands the issues, understands the questions on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| and is not afraid to ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| And people sometimes say his lawyerly training comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| But I think that's a good thing when people pursue the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| and try to really understand and get to the crux of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| And so, Rob has also really fought hard for neighborhood interests in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| And I know there's a lot of folks that are deeply grateful for the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| So, Rob, on behalf of the city, thank you for eight wonderful years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=925)|
| 0:15:34| Again, trying to be brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| I would agree with everything the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| That's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| And a last, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| I think the thing in addition to the hard work, I think more about smart work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| how much you accomplish quickly and efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| I wrote down something that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Rob can accomplish more with one phone call than I can with a week of talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| And that's not saying much because I talk all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| But we're going to miss that intelligent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| And we're going to be weaker because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| So, I'm going to miss you, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| Finally, Councilman Booker, who has served us for a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| but I think has served with dignity and with intelligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| And I think all of us really appreciate what you brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| It's hard to join a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| This group has actually served together for eight years and the whole group for six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| And so, it's hard to join midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| But I think Bob did that very naturally and easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| And I know that all of us took great pride and pleasure in working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| You served the city for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| He's a state representative in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| He was on the city's administration under Mayor Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| And so, he brought not just a lot of experience, but a lot of historical knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| And he could tell us things that happened in Knoxville 50 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| that changed the course of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| He was there, he claimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| But it made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| It helps a lot of times to have historical perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| And they say you get in trouble when you forget where you came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And Mr. Booker helped us remember where we came from, the good and the bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| And because of that, we're a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| We're very grateful that you would step into the breach here and serve us so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| Bob, I wanted to just, again, echo what Bill said about how well you stepped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| I think that's because when you stepped in, you were probably the wisest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| the moment you sat down in the chair of anybody sitting around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| because of everything you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Bill alluded to this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| I think for the other four up here, this is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| And you've done so many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| This is just sort of another award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| But you deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| And we are proud to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| And we have appreciated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| While we're standing, I'd love to give these retiring council members a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| if you'd like to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| You don't have to, but if you'd like to say a brief thank you, we'd love to give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| If you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| You can pass if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I'll be real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| First, would be remiss without thanking everybody here, my mother, my father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| my family that's put up with a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| As Bill and Bob briefly alluded to, I can be pretty tenacious when it comes to things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Other people can be tenacious about different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| But the one goal that everybody that serves the city is the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| to improve, to better, to make Knoxville the best it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| We just have different routes we choose to get there in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| And sometimes along the way, we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Sometimes we don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| But we ultimately are trying to get to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| I'm glad to have been able to serve with these folks for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| We haven't been marred by bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| We've served with dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| We've served for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| We have not served for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1161)|
| 0:19:32| There's pressure to keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Well, I appreciate Councilman Hall's eloquent statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| but, Rob, I really appreciate what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| And I feel very much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| It's been an incredible privilege and an honor to serve this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| And I am grateful for the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| And I hope that my service has fulfilled the desires of the people that trusted me with this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| I know I've missed opportunities, but I feel like I've pursued opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| in some cases tenaciously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| But I'm just very, very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| It's been an incredible eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| Well, it's just been an incredible eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| It's something I never dreamed that would ever come my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| And when term limits happened, I was not an advocate of term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| but that's the reason I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| So I'm grateful for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I can look out and just see so many of you, and I want to say I love you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| because we have had some wonderful experiences together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| We have, you know, the thing that I had looked so forward to was not working for the district from which I was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1259)|
| 0:21:10| not to serve, but to get to know people across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| And truly, your faces out there reflect that wonderful diversity of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| that wonderful opportunity to serve all the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| And Mayor Haslam, you just started some really good things in your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| We followed Mayor Ash completing some good things, which is very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| And thank you so much for empowering the neighborhoods to be a real part of Knoxville's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| And thank you all for your support and for your love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| And I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1310)|
| 0:22:02| For me, it's a real honor to have served my city in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| But more than that, the opportunity to meet these wonderful people who've served here on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| they're dedicated people, they're honorable people, and many times they're fun people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| So thank you so much for a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| If I could, I want to recognize two other people, and I'm going to ask one of those to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| He thinks he can sneak in, but he can't sneak anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| I want to ask the former Vice Mayor, Mark Brown, to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| You've got to. I'm the mayor. You've got to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1358)|
| 0:22:47| Mark had to. No, you've got to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Mark left us early to take a role as a judicial commissioner, and it's safe to say that we miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| He did a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| And Mark used to always say that he stood on the shoulders of those who came before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| And he always expressed that much more eloquently than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| But I can guarantee you for the time that he's been gone, this council has stood on his shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| So, Vice Mayor, we have missed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| We're glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| And on behalf of all of us, congratulations for the role you have played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| I was actually downstairs finishing up my judicial commissioner duties, and I saw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and I really just wanted to come up and stand in the back and do what I hope each and every one of you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| and that is to stand up right now and give this council, not me, this council, a round of applause for what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1417)|
| 0:23:57| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| And I think you can tell the heartfelt responses here, so thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| I said I wanted to recognize one more person, and this is probably out of line, but I have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| I don't know that any other non-city employee or anybody who's NPC or non-media related has been to as many city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| over the last eight years as Dr. Reuben Pelow, who we all know as Nip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| And it's one thing to sit in all these while you're up here debating and talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| but Nip has sat quietly and patiently and listened to it, and so somewhere there's a star in your crown, and we're very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1477)|
| 0:24:56| Okay. That is it for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| I will dispense with anything else, and we'll move to reports from members of council, if anybody has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. Becker does, and then I see Ms. Pelow's light, but Mr. Becker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| I guess I would be remiss if I did not remind folks about the swearing-in service this Saturday at noon in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1511)|
| 0:25:22| followed by a reception and then followed by a special call meeting here at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| Everybody is welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| It's a chance to welcome the new folks, I think most of whom or all of whom are even sitting in the audience right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| and we greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Well, I just wanted to recognize someone else who is here with some other people who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Bye, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Our daughter, Laurie Gooch, and her daughter, Barbara, her youngest daughter, Barbara Gooch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| And we'll stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| We're not being shy tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And Barbara's friend, Savannah, are here tonight because they had been wanting to come to a city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| We had just about run out of opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| So I'm just so glad they came tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| And thank you all for being here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I also wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| I'm glad we did that send-off for the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| And I also wanted to just offer my sincere gratitude and appreciation for Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1589)|
| 0:26:40| Your project is complete now that you have proved that you can do excellent council work without a cell phone and a laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| Which is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| But I also just want to thank Councilman Pelow, Frost, Hall, and Holquist just for all your service and your generosity to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1609)|
| 0:26:59| I did also want to say that this past week I met with VMC, Salvation Army, CARM, and Lieutenant Fortner in regard to, in the beginning of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1619)|
| 0:27:13| enforcing the sidewalk ordinance and the concern that I had and some of the council members had about making sure that people on the street were aware that this was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1633)|
| 0:27:25| That was the major topic of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| And Lieutenant Fortner is a solid person and very concerned about making sure that the people that his officers interact with on the street are aware of all the available resources to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1648)|
| 0:27:42| So it was a great meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Everybody's on board with really getting the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| And I hope and pray that it becomes a success in terms of that ordinance moving and motivating people into the services of the various agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1667)|
| 0:27:57| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Tomorrow evening there's an event called Tour de Lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| I believe it's the third annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| And I thought I had the exact starting time on my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Someone may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| It's seven, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| And it starts at Crouch Park downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| And I believe the route is into the Fourth and Gill neighborhood this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| Or Old North, Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| And both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| And it's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| People decorate their bicycles unbelievably with lights and just all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| And it's a whole lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| If you haven't done it before and you're up to bicycling in cold weather, I'm sure, Councilman Booker, you'll be there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| Then I encourage everybody to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Seeing no further lights, we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointment of Jean Teague as a consumer representative on the Record Services Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Could I just say Mrs. Teague is babysitting a grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| And she sent her apologies that she couldn't be here, but she very much appreciated the reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 5 of the Knoxville City Code so as to authorize restaurants within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| and certain outdoor dining areas requested by Councilmembers Roddy and Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Ms. Poplin provided for everyone this evening there are some minor kind of housekeeping amendments to this since the last time we heard it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1774)|
| 0:29:44| relative to some questions that the Law Department had upon further research about law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| So, Mr. Swanson, does that require a motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Then I would move to amend as noted in the highlighted copy that you received at your place this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| There are three folks signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| I'm going to go ahead and call on them now unless Council, unless I see a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| All three are signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I don't have anyone signed up to speak for, but I'm going to go ahead and take those against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| If there is somebody that wants to speak for, if you'd wave at me or something, we'll try to get you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| There's also rebuttal time, so I'll go ahead to those against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Ken Muller, then Ron Morton, then Bill Dockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| If you'd come to the podium, sir, and give us your name and address, and then you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Ken Muller, 211 Gilbert Lane, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| I speak to you wearing several hats, a homeowner in Knoxville, a transplant who voluntarily came to this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1847)|
| 0:30:58| the owner of a service dog, the owner of a service dog in training, a disabled veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| I'm also director of the Barrier Free Initiative, which seeks to eliminate all barriers to persons enjoying full life in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1865)|
| 0:31:15| So part of me says this is a great ordinance to enable people with pets to be able to go out and enjoy a fuller life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| and enjoyment in restaurants of their choices and the owner's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| On the other side, I'm concerned about the negative impact on persons with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| And from this I speak from personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| When I was a child, I was bit by a dog rather severely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| The reason given was I was pushing a bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| And this was unusual for the dog, no matter how well trained it was, so it bit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| I actually fought on behalf of the dog not to have it put away and so on, but that was long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| At the age of 82, my grandfather was out walking with a cane and was attacked by a well-trained, award-winning dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1920)|
| 0:32:12| Because the dog was thrown off by the fact that he had this cane with him and kind of lurched as he walked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1932)|
| 0:32:22| We're now talking about having persons with disabilities going to their favorite restaurants with wheelchairs, walkers, canes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1942)|
| 0:32:32| other types of persons with disabilities, and they may stumble and lurch and appear abnormal to pets that are otherwise well-trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1952)|
| 0:32:43| Now this is a training issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And the concern is the way the ordinance is written only addresses that the owner control their pets in the patio where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| I would suggest they must be in full control of that pet, or service dog, or training service dog, in the parking lot, coming to and from the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1974)|
| 0:33:05| They must be aware of the responsibilities that they will be engaging and encountering persons that they're not used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| Because the last thing we want is for a person with disabilities to decide they can't go to their favorite restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| Because they might slip on something in the parking lot, or be assaulted, or even be afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| Perhaps a person with autism, perhaps a person with memory loss, could be frightened by a dog that doesn't act normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| So I'm very much in favor of the spirit of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| I would strongly suggest there are training issues for the public and the restaurant owners with regards to how to deal with these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2021)|
| 0:33:51| More specifically is the issue of service dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| I believe it's paragraph one, subpart A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| That under the ordinance says that service dogs will be allowed in the restaurant and service dogs in training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| with some language implying that they must be able to prove or demonstrate that the dog is in some kind of special training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, has very clear definitions of what is and is not a service dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2055)|
| 0:34:24| This is constantly being challenged in the Department of Justice and may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| But you don't need any definition beyond what the Department of Justice allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| And I would strongly suggest that the wording be changed to a service dog as defined by the U.S. Department of Justice and leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2074)|
| 0:34:43| Thirty more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| The problem is service dogs and service dogs in training have no clear-cut definition, especially in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| Anyone can claim that their service dog is in training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| and we all know there are persons who even today try to pass off assistance animals, therapy animals, and so on as service animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| So I would suggest only service dogs as defined by the U.S. Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| Your name, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| My name is Ron Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| I live at 2000 Stock Creek Road, South Knox, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| And I'm the Vice Chair of your Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And I want to be very clear that I'm not anti-dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| I have 14 dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| That's a lot of dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| My wife and I rescue greyhounds and bassets and airdales and any other things she takes a fancy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| And I'm happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I love dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I've got some good dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| I don't think I have any bad dogs, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| No dog owner does that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| But I do have some squirrels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I've got some squirrely dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| And the truth is that I would be very, very reluctant to take any of my dogs around a person who has a service animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2170)|
| 0:36:22| If you know anything about service animals and people who need them, it's very important that that dog attend to that person that they're serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2182)|
| 0:36:32| Distractions can create real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| And as wonderful as my dogs are, the best of dogs, sometimes get into altercations for reasons we don't understand because they're dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2197)|
| 0:36:47| They are pack animals, and they react strongly to each other at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| You've seen the amendments to the ordinance that the Council has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| They've asked me, the Council as a whole, and we met last Friday, as a matter of fact, in our retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| to make clear that we are not in favor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| But we also are not foolish enough to stand in the way of a public that really wants their dogs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2231)|
| 0:37:20| So we want it done carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| We want it done with attention to the needs of the people who have those service animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| people like Cynthia Anderson, who's here with us right now, who have a difficult time getting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| Where a service animal that's distracted could be a real issue for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| I've worked with folks with disabilities for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| I've known a lot of folks with service animals, and I know how very, very important they are to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| So I wanted to express the decision of the Council on Disability Issues to let you know where we stand with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2267)|
| 0:37:57| and to also communicate to you personally that we may be incurring a risk here to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| and it's something that we really need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you, Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Mr. Dockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| My name is Bill Dockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I live at 4615 Holston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| I, too, have two dogs in my household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| I am a cat person who married badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| And I rise as the Secretary of CODI to express and echo some of the concerns that the previous speakers have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2317)|
| 0:38:51| One of the things that we have to be aware of is that the animals that are expensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| and extensively trained provide vital services in the life of people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| They're not fashion accessories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| They're not Beverly Hills Chihuahuas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| They're not casual pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| They're there to provide services for that person more than as a companion, as a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| I want to thank you for adapting some of the things we've already told you into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| We made some calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I talked myself to the Seeing Eye Foundation in New Jersey, who actually is not against having service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2371)|
| 0:39:41| or having non-service dogs on patios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| They said that dogs, untrained dogs, are a serious source of injury to trained dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| They are a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| But they're not limited to restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| They're on the streets as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| So, in some senses, an untrained and uncontrolled dog is a danger to any service animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| We want to, as the councilman said earlier, we want to improve to make Knoxville a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2406)|
| 0:40:16| And to make it a better place for people who must use service dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| we at CODI would prefer not to see this amendment enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| We would prefer to see no pets, no casual pets in a patio situation for dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2428)|
| 0:40:39| If this must pass, I think putting the dogs on a short, fixed lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| the Seeing Eye folk recommended four to six feet, no more than a six-foot lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| And that would help control the dogs in other circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Again, my thanks for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Thanks, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Okay, comments from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| I was just wondering how the folks who sponsored this would feel about amending it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| as the first speaker suggested, the U.S. Department of Justice definition of a service dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| You know, I actually looked and I don't see any place in here right now where we refer to a service dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| Well, I mean, it just says we don't define it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| I mean, we just say a pet dog is a dog other than a service dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| That's why I think the motion is to adopt the Department of Justice definition of a service dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| As defined by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Now I understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| The motion has been amended twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| We did not vote on the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| We didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| But there's been two amendments put on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| So I'm going to start with the second amendment is what we're going to vote on first that Mr. Frost made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Just so we're clear, we're now voting on the amendment that Mr. Frost made that we would define it as a U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Department of Justice defines it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| The first amendment is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Now we're back to the second amendment, which just refresh us, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I think you passed out, but just so everybody's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| The second amendment is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Now we're back to the second amendment, which just refresh us, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I think you passed out, but just so everybody's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| The second amendment is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=2566)|

| 1:18:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| This is more about KUB in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| I got a couple of calls from folks that had questions about KUB and they couldn't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| contact information readily accessible for your management and your commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| And just a polite suggestion to make that easier for people to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| And also things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| A $30 million bond is a significant part of KUB's inner workings and a debt obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4708)|
| 1:18:37| that's going to last for years to come that might be beneficial for the public to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Like they can go to a city council part of the city website and see this, see any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| actions that the city council is going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4728)|

| 1:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| We'll be happy to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| And I believe on our website we do have the listings of all the commissioners and contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| numbers for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| But we'll be happy to take a look at that and do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| Mr. Hoppus, is your board meeting tomorrow, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| The board meeting is on Thursday, December 17th at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| I had it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| I had it on my calendar for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| So thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Mr. Hoppus, this bond issue, is this going to go all to PACE 10 projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| The majority of it will go to PACE 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| The bond issue will fund wastewater system capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| About 90% of that is for the PACE 10 collection system projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| So the same will hold true for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| So probably 25 to 27 million of it will go for the PACE 10 projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4786)|

| 1:20:09| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2009-2010 to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4809)|

| 1:20:16| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| With council's permission, I'd like to recognize Carol Evans, Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| of Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I'm vice chair of this board and am very much in favor of this project and would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| to give her an opportunity to give us an update on the River Bluff project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| I'm Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive, and I want to thank you for considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| Our board voted yesterday to move forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| We are in the midst of a fundraising campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| The asking price for this particular piece of property is $1.6 million, and we are over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| at $1.3 million in that fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| It's a critical piece of property in what we consider saving the viewshed from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| It's the bluff you see as you look across the river from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| All of you see it out the window here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| It's also important, we think, the mayor has expressed his interest in helping support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| the South Waterfront development by keeping this property green and letting the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| occur down below where it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| It's a key corridor connecting Iams Nature Center literally to Maryville through a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| of greenways, so you would be able, and that creates 1,000 acres of green space in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| downtown, and also provides protection of four critical historic sites, three Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| War forts, and Armstrong's Hill, which was an important battle site on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| So we think for all of these reasons, we have incredible assets across the river and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| just need to acquire two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| Appreciate the opportunity and your interest in supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| We have a December 31st deadline with a developer out of Athens, Georgia, so we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| very, very hard to get to that, and your contribution will be an important step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| It will also ultimately be a city park, which is important to note as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| Probably the most important thing for you to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| It's a beautiful 70 acres, two ponds, and the most outstanding view of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| Absolutely, as soon as we raise the money, we'll convey it to the city, and it has an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| easement on it that will perpetually keep it in that condition it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| Councilwoman Rudd, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Councilman Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Well, I just wanted to chime in and say thank you for all the work that Legacy Parks has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| It's a phenomenal project, acquiring all the properties that are coming in under this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| and of course, again, we can never thank Aslan Foundation enough for what they did in acquiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| the Log Haven property, an adjacent property, and really helping make this happen, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| it wouldn't have happened without their initiative and their incredible generosity to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| all started, and thanks to Pilot Corporation and all the other contributors that are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| I think this is very appropriate, and I believe it's going to be a great, I don't know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| best term, symbiosis is really kind of a tacky term these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| It sounds a little too technical, but it will work in conjunction with the south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| development, I think, to make it an incredible destination and opportunity area for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| Knoxville and the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=4992)|

| 1:24:25| I'll second it for discussion purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Council, the reason I put this on here, it obviously will not have any impact on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| of us that are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| As you know, Council can increase its, the pay for Council hasn't happened in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| It has to take effect after the next regular city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| So, in thinking about this, I thought it might be appropriate to ask the voters if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| they thought it was appropriate for Council to be included in the annual pay raise that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| is guaranteed to all city employees, and not put Council in such an awkward position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| You have to increase it or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| And I thought it might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Now, that's just one Council member, and again, it doesn't affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| This is for future Council members and future Councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| But, and again, it would be up to the voters to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| But I thought it might be appropriate to put that question before the voters and see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| that would be acceptable to them, because it would, as our automatic pay increase for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| the rest of city employees as applied to, as indicated in the article, it allows for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5137)|
| 1:25:45| inflation, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| And I thought it might be a good thing to allow for adequate compensation for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| Councils and Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| So that's my reason for putting this on, and I'd be interested to see if anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| has anything to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| I guess this is for Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| Does the 2.5% mandated pay increase for city employees apply to part-time employees or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| only to full-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| I'm going to say I think this is an interesting idea that Mr. Holquist put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| And at some point, potentially, the new Council might be considering some of these and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| at the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| And so thanks for raising the issue, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| It doesn't sound like it's going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Well, I appreciate Councilman Holquist doing what he believes in and at least making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| stab at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| But on one hand, I'm one that believes that, you know, we serve for the right reasons and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| not for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| And even if you did believe that there ought to be more incentive to serve or a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5216)|
| 1:27:04| salary, I don't think that you would find the voters very, you know, this would be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| difficult to proceed now anyway with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| So, but I appreciate you trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5235)|

| 1:27:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5237)|

| 1:27:20| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5240)|

| 1:30:37| for its vision and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| When our quiet neighborhood was faced with a development which threatened to turn our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| pedestrian and family-friendly street into an extension of a driveway for a major retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| store, the attention and many hours of work by members of this council found a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| which worked for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Your action in building the boulevard entrance to Gibbs Drive enhances the Broadway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5456)|

| 1:31:16| to all of our requests on all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5476)|

| 1:31:46| Your work as caring, thoughtful, and active council members is an example to be emulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| by future councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5511)|

| 1:32:08| Already moved down close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| She's been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| I'm trying to save you time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Terri Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| And I'm here tonight representing the Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| and members of the Citywide Neighborhood Coalition and my own self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| And first speaking for the members of the Bearden Council, and Jim Bletner was also going to come tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| but he couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| I want to thank all of you for the financial support that you've given in matching our CMAQ funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| for our pedestrian village greenway, for the support of Mayor Haslam and your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| And without the great administration, engineering, public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5572)|
| 1:33:00| Barbara Pillow could not have done all the things she has for us in Bearden and in our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| because she's been the oil that has smoothed the way for contributions by TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| by individual developers and merchants in adding sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| She's done an incredible job, and I want to thank her tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| and the rest of you for the many, many ways in which you've helped us turn the Bearden community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| into an environmentally sustainable area to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| Secondly, I want to thank you for the members of the Citywide Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| for helping to put a lot of foundation stones in place that are going to secure neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| and protect and enrich the lives of residents in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| With the parking ordinance, and constantly I hear from people who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| you don't know how this has helped our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| For traffic calming, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| And for the many, many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| We are really sincerely appreciative for all you've done for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| And for the city as a whole, things like voting for EMC legislation, for supporting our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5653)|
| 1:34:23| for our parks and greenways, and for helping to preserve those things in our city that make our city unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5663)|
| 1:34:31| like the urban corridor and the historic sites that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| We're going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| And we thank you sincerely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| We appreciate everything you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| We won't forget you, and we want to work with you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| And I wish you all well in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| That is a wonderful note to end up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| And one more time, I think all of us want to thank Councilman Holquist, Councilwoman Pilo, Councilman Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| Councilman Frost, and Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| You have served well and with distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| We'll miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| And I see Councilman Bailey's light, and I'm going to recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| I just wanted to say how much of an honor it's been to serve with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| and the way you've conducted your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| And I've enjoyed it, and thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5723)|

| 1:35:25| Well, there's someone here tonight that I would like to welcome back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| because, Anita, I was so excited to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5730)|

| 1:35:37| But our thoughts and our prayers and our love has been with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| And I just wanted to be sure that we mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| because you have done so much for so many people in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5743)|

| 1:35:52| I just wanted to point that out because this has been a rough few months for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091215?start=5752)|
