| 2:17:44| I'll start by echoing what Commissioner Hill just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| in that I think that land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| is tailor-made for this type of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| It's clear that this piece of land is huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| I mean, in acreage and in impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| to the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| and to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| So how this piece of land is treated is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| It requires thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| It requires time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| This piece of land or this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| has sat vacant for less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| And so I don't know that I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| that that falls under the definition of blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| or pending blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8304)|
| 2:18:29| Looking across the street in all directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| you see the success of Sam's Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| of Walmart, of Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| There's new development in all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| coming into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| So there is development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| and there is sustainable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| I don't see that this area has blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| It has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| I don't deny that the specific land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| of a distribution center would bring a lot of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| a lot of profit, a lot of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| a lot of economic boost into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| But we still have to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| that the way this is treated is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| That the way this is treated is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| I think I could look into plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| so that in the event that the deal falls through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| it reverts back to its original zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| I think I could also get on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| with the city being able to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| for rezoning it back in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| that the deal falls through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| I know that we can't condition rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| I'd feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| with the city's commitment to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| if there was a more concrete way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| to ensure that they would apply for rezoning back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| in the event that the deal fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| Considering that this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| has only sat vacant for less than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| I don't know that we want to be so quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| to jump and fill the space out of fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| because it really is important what goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| So I know that time kills deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| and it seems that this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| and this owner is committed to doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| what they need to do to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| So if time kills deals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| I don't know if that sounds like they want to commit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| So I would feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| that they do want to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| if they would be more cooperative in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| I also want to point out a previous case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| we just discussed, item number 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| that was requesting light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| to heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| We had commissioners saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| that the point of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| is to try to align more with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| not move away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| And while there is some industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| a little bit by this piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| the last case that we just voted on and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| made more sense for a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Staff recommended to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| because it wasn't consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| even though it was almost landlocked by industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| This has an apartment complex right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| It has commercial right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| The North City sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| doesn't call for this area to have industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| The East City sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| while it's technically not in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| speaks on this piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| and it doesn't say that industrial is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| And so we apply industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| actually taking away the distribution center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| and just looking at land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| It could be anything from a solar farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| to a heliport where helicopters land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| And it could be a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| than just a distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| So once we lay that there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| it sets a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| And that's something we've also talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| When you do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| it sets a precedent for the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| that more cases will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| If we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| it means a difference, a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| For better or for worse, it could be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| But it means a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| for what happens in this area coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| I'll also say that as far as traffic goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| a traffic study hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| I don't see how they could analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| And it's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| The thing with that though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| is that since we can't figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| how many jobs this will create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| and how much traffic it'll generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| we also can't look at the subsequent development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| that would spark from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| So TDOT could very well improve this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| reconfigure it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| and it would already be outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| for the pending development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| So I think how the traffic patterns go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| is very important for this working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| In the town meeting on September 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| they talked about noise mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| and meeting the noise ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8559)|
| 2:22:40| that the boundary of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| wouldn't exceed 60 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| which is a normal conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| Looking at noise decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| or looking at the noise ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| from 12 a.m. to 7 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| it talks about being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| to be at 70 to 80 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| Looking into what different decibels are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| a motorcycle is normally at 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| And so I can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| that a semi-truck sitting idly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| is the same volume as me talking right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| let alone hundreds of trucks revving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| I don't see how that protects the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| that are right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| The sector plan calls for a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| to come along this area soon enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| And I just don't know that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| want this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| Just looking at the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| I think logistically and factually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| this doesn't seem like the right use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| I can't speak to what the right zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| would be for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| But subjectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| I can't imagine that anyone would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| a distribution center in their backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| in any part of town here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| We could ask ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| do we want this in Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| We know what the answer to that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| We could ask if we want it in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| if we want it downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| if we want it in North Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| off Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| We know what the answer to that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| So I don't see why all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| it's acceptable here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| So I just ask that you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| if you would want to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| in that apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| I don't think you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| I can't speak for you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| but it just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| I would feel more comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| with a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| And so let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| if they're interested in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| Commissioner Dent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| if I could recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| you might want to turn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| your volume a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| We're getting some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| from your computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| I wanted to ask Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| if he would be willing to articulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| the reason again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| as to why planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| isn't being pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| Yes, Commissioner Adams, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| And thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| I did try to outline that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| in my submission as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| because I know that's an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| You know, the planned development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| does take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| At the recent workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| on planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| Executive Director Brooks said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| you know, it would take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8710)|
| 2:25:10| you know, six months or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| And to be frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| that's just an estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| because I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| there's been a development yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| that has completed that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| There are a couple going through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| going through it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8725)|
| 2:25:25| And when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| a piece of property this big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| if it were under a single ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| and we only had one contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| that we had to negotiate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| we may be able to confidently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| extend that due diligence period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| and go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| But we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| four different parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| Corporate Dillard's has been closed since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| They still own one of the four parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| We also, I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Belk is another company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| that owns one of the other parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| So we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| with Corporate Council that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| you know, have frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| you know, they know how to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| So they want this to move quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| and they have put us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| under a very quick timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| If we thought we could go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| and keep these contracts in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| we would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| We absolutely would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| We understand this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| is important enough to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| to have the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8786)|
| 2:26:26| That's one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| why we reached out very early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| to have the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| And we're still willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| So that's the reason is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| we just, we don't have the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| trying to keep four contracts up in the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| to do it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| I've got two other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| One is a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| based on your comments, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| If Amy Brooks is on the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| just to clarify the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| of the projects that we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| moving through the plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| is it correct for me to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| that the process has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| the reason those have moved slowly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| That the applicants are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| each of those are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| but the ball goes back to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| to work through things and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| It's not that the process is slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| It's that the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| are perhaps moving more slowly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| when it comes to doing their components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| Yes, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8858)|
| 2:27:38| I mean, it is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| There are pre-application meetings required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| They have the optional concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| There's a preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| that has to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| by planning commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| And then you have your final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| We've only had two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8872)|
| 2:27:53| plan development applications to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| So I don't know that that's a good judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| in terms of, and what I stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| during the council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| was really just an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| We don't really have a firm idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| of how long these are going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| to get to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| We have one, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| if I got the time right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| it was approved by planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| and then by council by June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| And then you all will hear it next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| for the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| So if that gives you some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| And then we have another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| that you all have approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| the preliminary plan and council has as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| but we haven't received a final plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| So a lot of this is on the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| and on how quickly that they can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| and how ready they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| in terms of moving through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| So the timeline, it's really hard to nail down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| The second thing, just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| I drive this area every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| and I have for the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| And so I feel like I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| sort of a daily view of the decline of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8932)|
| 2:29:00| You know, it's like, it's attrition and atrophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| And now it's completely empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| And it is a huge area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| that while it has these successful businesses around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| and successful parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| Harvest Park is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| This is such a huge footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| that the community, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| feels its absence even greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| And this is a significant opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| to make that quickly become alive again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| I regret that the plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| isn't being taken right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8981)|
| 2:29:41| because I do feel like it is probably the best route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| But I appreciate Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| and Commissioner Dent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| talking about some of the options that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| in addition to plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8997)|
| 2:29:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| Let me mention that I don't see any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| why we can't have special call meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| to expedite approvals for plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| It's not a common occurrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| but I think it's one that we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| to speed up the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| and make everybody more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| I would agree with those who have spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| that the plan development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| is really the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| Yes, Council or even the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| could recommend rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| if the project failed to materialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| But let me remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| that if an application came in for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| and it was zoned industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| and the use was allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| under the current zoning of industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| it would be difficult to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| and try to rezone it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| So that's an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| that I think we all need to feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| But personally, I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| the plan development process followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| not opposed to the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| just opposed to having a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| that's rezoned industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| and the project does not materialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| Yes, I also want to speak toward plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| As I understand the explanation about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| it really has two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| Either we proceed with the rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| and then after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| the applicant does all of the site work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| the engineering and the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| or the applicant does the site work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| engineering, traffic study beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| and then we go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| I do not see that plan development by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| is a hindrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| I'm very concerned about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| I'm very concerned about the off ramp from 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| I've seen it back up onto the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| and I'm very concerned about what the truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| and the employee traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| will do to an already bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9128)|
| 2:32:12| This is in addition to the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| that the distribution center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| will have on the immediate area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| residential, commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| and the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| Sure, it will create a lot of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| and I'm for the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| I like the distribution center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| but it is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| that's going to attract shoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| It's basically enclosed warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9154)|
| 2:32:40| So I think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| to really look at plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| Yeah, I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| I'd like to ask my first question to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| I think he mentioned that his tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| is this, you propose this deal to your tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| assuming you get your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| How long does it typically take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| to get a commitment out of that tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| where you know you have a deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9189)|
| 2:33:16| Can you answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| It's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9202)|
| 2:33:25| And we're going through that process now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| and we feel like we're getting close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| But it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| we've probably been working on it for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| And, you know, our plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| for this all to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| probably in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| with the zoning getting finalized in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| and then being past the appeal period in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| You feel like you want to answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| I'm just asking like how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| we are the ones that kind of would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| I mean, we're not really at risk personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| but I said as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| you know, we are going to consider approving a zoning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9237)|
| 2:34:02| that doesn't have really any review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| Basically, with the hopes that you as a great developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| and we hope the tenant would be a great tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| and your product will be a very nice facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| that we'll all be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| I've seen some pictures from Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| and the other ones we've done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| are really impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| And, you know, if we get to that point, we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| I think everybody could agree it's a win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| You know, I guess our concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| how long are we going to be at risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| Because, you know, once we rezone the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| if your deal doesn't work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| then we've got a big kind of major piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| that's significant in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| that's just wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| And so I guess what I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| I would think it'd be a year you knew for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| No, I think I understand your question better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| So our schedule that we've laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| when we talked to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9300)|
| 2:35:01| and that we've laid out with our customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| is that so hopefully we go through the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| in November and that zoning is approved in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| It becomes past the appeal period in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| We close on the property in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| and we're under construction the 1st of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| So it's pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| So that quickly, you'll know that it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9326)|
| 2:35:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| And that feeds into the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| You know, I can only use the dates that I'm being told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| but I'm being told it takes around six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| which by the way, is what happens in every other city too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| That's not unique to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| But that's why, you know, besides the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| of keeping the properties tied up from the sellers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| my customer needs to get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9356)|
| 2:35:56| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9356)|
| 2:35:56| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| That makes me feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| My next question is going to be for, I guess, for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| And again, my biggest concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| I mean, like I said, I'm impressed with developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| I'm impressed with the prospects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9367)|
| 2:36:08| of what that property can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| But when I look at the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| the industrial zoning choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| you know, again, we really don't have a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| of looking at lighting, landscaping, and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| So I looked at section 6.5 general standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| And my question is for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| do those general standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| what kind of requirements with a non-planned zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| that we're considering here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| It says that there are standards of site development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| off street parking, or landscaping and signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| can somebody tell us if that applies to this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| and what kind of standards would be imposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9406)|
| 2:36:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9411)|
| 2:36:51| This is Michelle Portier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| I'm the planner who reviewed this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| So all of those standards are applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| to any project that comes into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| And so the landscaping, for example, that's buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| and that's going to be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| between residential and non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| There's also landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| within the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| So you have to have landscaped islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| between every so much spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| and a certain percentage of the area has to be plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| Also, there's an area around the perimeter of roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| and things like that that needs to be planted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| We did hear that, you know, there's been talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| about a strip of property that is between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| actually, Taryn, can you stop sharing for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9455)|
| 2:37:38| well, hold on, can you stop sharing your screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| Okay, so this strip of property right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9467)|
| 2:37:52| is not included in the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| but it's about, I measured it yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| I want to say it's around 80 feet deep, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| And it's not included in the rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| it's not included in the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| but as far as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| it is slated to be planted with plantings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9488)|
| 2:38:11| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| So that would come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Other site development standards, exterior lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| there's, it's required to be downward facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9497)|
| 2:38:21| so that the glare doesn't extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| onto residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| And there's foot candles standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| there's off-street parking and loading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| there's going to be, that's just basically looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9511)|
| 2:38:34| at the use and how much parking they would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| Unfortunately, we can't make conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| into the zoning to route the traffic on North Mall Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| although the applicant has stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| that they are looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| So that, I hope that helps answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| without going too deeply into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| but those would be required here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| And also just a point of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| with regard to what the sector plan says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| about industrial uses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9540)|
| 2:39:03| So M-U-R-C is the land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| And one of the criterias for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| it says the location does not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| auto and truck oriented uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9552)|
| 2:39:13| such as industrial, strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| commercial warehouse distribution uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| unless the proposal calls for redevelopment of such areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| which seems to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| It's headed in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| because the applicant's developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| has worked on a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9565)|
| 2:39:26| and will need to have that reviewed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| But it is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| The small area plans within those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| those are based on conditions at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| that we're looking at the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| This was done while the mall was still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| And yes, it has been only closed a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| but it has been a steady state of decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| since Dillard's closed its doors and even before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| And so it's not just the small area plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| but also the actual land use category that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| And so even though they're requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| to change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| the current one would allow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| with a redevelopment of such areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| just as, again, as a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9601)|
| 2:40:25| Commissioner Phillips, you're muted if you're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| Thank you, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9628)|
| 2:40:34| Mr. Mullins, I was looking at the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| that was provided and it shows two separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| And during the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| I hear a singular of client, not clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| Is your client both buildings or one building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9648)|
| 2:40:55| And is the other building speculative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| or just your concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| Thank you for that question, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| No, we have one single client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| Now there will be two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| There may be different types of distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| for different buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| And we may even have that separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| into separate lots because of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9677)|
| 2:41:21| But it's just a single client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| And we have looked at ways we can adjust that site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| Going back to Ms. Portier's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| about the traffic going on to Mall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| This is a distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9696)|
| 2:41:37| If we are in gridlock from traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| whether traffic that we cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| or traffic that's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| we're not gonna be a very successful distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| So we have every incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9706)|
| 2:41:49| to improve the flow of traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| And North Mall Road makes the most sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| in being able to route the traffic that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| Mr. Murphy in his email is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| Going to Millertown Pike and Kensal Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| is just completely unworkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| And we have adjusted our site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| to try to take into account those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| as we are studying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| We know there's plans to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| the interstate interchanges there for TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| that's been on hold for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| I don't know why they're on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| I know why they've told Mr. Murphy why they're on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| We think that a development of this significance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| would really help spur along those plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| which are already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| that just haven't come to fruition yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| So we want to make this site plan work for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9760)|
| 2:42:44| or we're not gonna be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| What I ask that we allow Mr. David Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| he's calling in via telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9771)|
| 2:42:56| He was unable to connect, I guess, previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| So if we could allow Mr. Brown to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| and then we'll continue on with commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9782)|
| 2:43:11| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| All right, if we can get him connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| Mr. Chair, I'm asking him to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9804)|
| 2:43:38| While we wait on Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| I'm gonna recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| Phillips, a couple of things just for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| to kind of put a little bit bigger concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| for you to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| If thinking about the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| and I did speak with Steve Borden today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| and based on the information he's been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| on the number of cracker trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| he doesn't see that that is gonna significantly impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| the traffic from a negative standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| just because of the safety improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| of widening the ramp coming onto Westbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| as well as the four and a half million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| widening project of Millertown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| from that Westbound off ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| all the way down to Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| But I think if we go the plan development route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| knowing what I know about some state things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| if we go light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| that leaves an arrow in the quiver for Stephanie Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| to be able to approach ECD and Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| to draw down some ECD funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9876)|
| 2:44:39| for very fast road improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| If we go planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| then it has to go through the typical TPO route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| of getting everything on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| Then it has to be funded through the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| It's a much slower process to get funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| to fix any road projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Whereas the funding through ECD with light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| would give at least Stephanie an arrow in her quiver to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| and try and get some of those funds with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| to make road improvements faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| The other thing is, as it's been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| Dillard's did close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| In all transparency, I represented this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| and worked with Ronnie Collins, Nick Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| We worked for years to try and help revitalize the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| But the mall area, if you think about the triangle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| from Target to Walmart to Home Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| in 2013, that triangle was almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| a half a billion dollar economic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| That continued to decline over years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| As a result, the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| have lost millions of dollars in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| The state, city, county lost millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| in sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| Now, we're not gonna get that sales tax revenue back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| but we can start reclaiming a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| of the property tax revenue back with a development as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| And thinking about the 500 to 1,000 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| if you look at that, I'm just kind of going off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| an Amazon facility in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| You're looking at anywhere from a 25 to $50 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| payroll, that's a lot of economic activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| for people in our community to have great paying jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| that allows them to buy better houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| It puts all that money back into our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9975)|
| 2:46:19| And again, thinking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| you've got a city mayor who is in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| a county mayor who's in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| Speaking with Stephanie Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| I mean, this is something they'd love to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| I live 1.1 miles from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| I've drive through all of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| You know, it's something that I would love to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| And then I saw in the email from Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| that, you know, he has made a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| that if this falls through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| that they will come back to rezone it lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10002)|
| 2:46:46| because his intent is for this one thing to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| So I'm gonna take him at his word and trust all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| But I think it's just something that would be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| for the East Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| that honestly has for years felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| they have just been forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| And we finally have a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| that are focusing on trying to make something positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| So I would highly encourage everyone to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| and let's move this project forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| and hope that we can bring, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| anywhere from 500 to a thousand jobs to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| Commissioner Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| So I have a question for planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10044)|
| 2:47:32| If we chose to, you know, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| hey, let's give them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| to apply for plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10057)|
| 2:47:41| I know that there's not a kind of concrete timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| on how long that would take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| but for them to do the optional concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| or to submit the official plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10069)|
| 2:47:54| the official first plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| how long would that process take for them to apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| Assuming they had everything together as of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| for example, you know, if they applied today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10082)|
| 2:48:06| for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| how long would it be before a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| could be set up to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| And I also want to say that I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| you know, Commissioner Phillips mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| that we would be willing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| you know, emergency meetings to move it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| I'm in full support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| We don't have to have it go slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| if the applicant is on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| So I asked that because I think it would be interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| if we could maybe postpone for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| if that would be enough time for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| to do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| I don't know if I want to even set 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| because if we needed to do an emergency meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| to meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| if they could get it together quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| I would be on board to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| to make sure that they stay on their timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| Yes, like earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| there's not any specific timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| It kind of depends on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| Right now we've expired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| or the November Planning Commission deadline has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| So this would be an application for December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| if they were to turn it in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| unless there was a function for an emergency meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| With that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10151)|
| 2:49:11| they would have to have their plans finalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| which would require the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| and all those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| So I think that would probably be a ways down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10162)|
| 2:49:22| And City Council also has to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| So it would be an additional period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| And I also just want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| that it's not just planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| that review a plan development when it comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| It's also our colleagues in the city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| and other departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| I'd like to recognize Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| Ms. Welch, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10193)|
| 2:49:54| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| Your thoughts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| and you've worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| you've met with these individuals recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| and you probably know more about the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| than any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| So anything you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| Thanks so much for recognizing me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| And thank you to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| I so appreciate the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10215)|
| 2:50:18| and really thoughtful deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| that you have had throughout this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| and particularly on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| So I'm Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| I'm the Deputy to Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| and the Chief of Economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10229)|
| 2:50:30| and Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| And so one of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| that I wanted to address directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| and on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| because it's been mentioned a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| is that if this property is indeed rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| and the project doesn't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10244)|
| 2:50:47| for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10247)|
| 2:50:48| the city is committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| to initiating a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| back to the current zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| or an appropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| as recommended by the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| and planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| So we're committed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| I've already talked with our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| about how that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10266)|
| 2:51:07| I know that that's a significant concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10267)|
| 2:51:08| I've heard it during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10268)|
| 2:51:13| And so I want to say that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| That's a very unusual move for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| It's not something that we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| I doubt that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10281)|
| 2:51:22| has ever expressed that publicly before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| for any type of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| But I think there are a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| that you've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| during this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| that make this a very different scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| And the first is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| or set of properties really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| is not just important to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| but it really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| a regionally significant parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| That's been in decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| for more than a decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10314)|
| 2:51:55| and has declined even further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| just over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| It has a huge impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| on the surrounding community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| and not just economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| but I think also it's concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| for the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| We have a reputable developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| that has been very intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| about reaching out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| And I just want to thank Hillwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| and their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10347)|
| 2:52:28| because I think that's a really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| that's a good sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| of corporate citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| And as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10352)|
| 2:52:33| we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| I haven't heard any really direct opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| to the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| There are some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10360)|
| 2:52:41| that have been expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| as there typically are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| with big development projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| but no direct opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| More concern that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| around things that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10372)|
| 2:52:55| has indicated an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| in engaging on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10378)|
| 2:52:59| So things like traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10379)|
| 2:53:01| and noise and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10381)|
| 2:53:05| We always appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| a significant investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| And I think Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| and Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| both indicated this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| and others as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| that this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10395)|
| 2:53:15| a significant investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10395)|
| 2:53:17| which has an economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10397)|
| 2:53:20| not just in the investment itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| but also in the jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| that would come along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| So I think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| from an economic development standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| As far as timing goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10413)|
| 2:53:34| and I think one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| that needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10420)|
| 2:53:41| I hope today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| we're often in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| where we're competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10425)|
| 2:53:46| with other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10426)|
| 2:53:47| for these kinds of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| And there's a tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| that's lined up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| and they're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| And so we're in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| where time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| And it just happens to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| that we're in a great place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| right now with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| and the timing that's laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| between planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| and council for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| So timing is very critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| And some of the other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| that have been brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| around traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| I think the city is also committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| to working with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| all the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| connecting some dots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10468)|
| 2:54:29| that otherwise wouldn't be connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| if there weren't a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| of this significance on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| It really raises it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| to the top of the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| So Harold Cannon is also on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| If anybody had any questions for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| he's our engineering director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| But the city certainly sees this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| as a real positive for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| We're excited about the prospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| and appreciate the time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| that planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| is putting into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| We have a lot of respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10505)|
| 2:55:06| for planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| and appreciate their recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| Hope that the property does get rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| and the project can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| We think it would be a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10516)|
| 2:55:23| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| I'm going to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| If I had just a quick question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| for the transportation engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| During preliminary agenda meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| I had asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10542)|
| 2:55:43| when the off ramp would be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10543)|
| 2:55:50| And I think he was going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| Is there a schedule now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| for that improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| Mr. Cannon, are you available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10558)|
| 2:56:06| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| We have not heard back from TDOT yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| We're still pursuing that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| The one thing I would offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10571)|
| 2:56:15| and Commissioner Smith spoke to this well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| is that I know there's been a delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| probably of Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| about five years feedback there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| I'll confess we're not lily white either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| And I've talked with Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| about this regarding Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| I just want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10593)|
| 2:56:34| what Deputy Mayor Welch has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| And that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| I think we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| to pull all of these projects together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| at one time in a coordinated effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10601)|
| 2:56:46| And I am confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10606)|
| 2:56:47| that this thing does go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| that you will see the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| the city and TDOT beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| to be able to answer these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10614)|
| 2:56:55| very, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| And Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| I don't want to completely speak for TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| But when I did speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| with Steve Borden this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| he did tell me that the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| as well as the Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| all the way from that ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| all the way down to Loves Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10631)|
| 2:57:12| is in the design process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| Is it also true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| that the form of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| whether it's a plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| as versus a rezone has an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| on how the improvements are funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10649)|
| 2:57:34| So, yes, I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10654)|
| 2:57:35| that from the state standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| ECD will only fund projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| that are industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| That is what their rules require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| So if we keep this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| out of the industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10667)|
| 2:57:48| obviously that takes that off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10668)|
| 2:57:52| And that's why I was making the suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10672)|
| 2:57:53| that we not take anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| out of Stephanie's quiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| that she has all arrows possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| to try and get as much funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| and support to get road projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| completed as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10687)|
| 2:58:08| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| I apologize earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| when I asked questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| my lost connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10697)|
| 2:58:18| But I got back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| and I've been listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10700)|
| 2:58:20| and I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10700)|
| 2:58:21| the more I hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10701)|
| 2:58:22| everybody is on board with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| And I just feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| the wind's at our backs on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| And I feel like I'm convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| that this is the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| is to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| So I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| throw a motion out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10718)|
| 2:58:39| if that's OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| that we amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| the North City sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10723)|
| 2:58:46| to approve the light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10726)|
| 2:58:47| industrial designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10727)|
| 2:58:48| since it would allow redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| of a regionally significant site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10730)|
| 2:58:51| and prevent blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| Second Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| We have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| seconded by Commissioner Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| from mixed use regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| to light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| Yes, I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10750)|
| 2:59:10| I just saw the message from Amy Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| where they finally have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| Mr. Brown on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| and wondered if he could actually speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| That's thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Mr. Brown, would you like to speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| Yes. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10763)|
| 2:59:24| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| OK, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| Most of what you've spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| most of what I would speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10771)|
| 2:59:32| has already been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| but I'll identify myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| My name is David Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| I'm with Brown Brown West Real Estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| and my address is 2020 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| We own and manage Easttown Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| above this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| So I appreciate your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| in letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10789)|
| 2:59:50| I had a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10790)|
| 2:59:51| I've been on this call all afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| but I haven't been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| get through somehow to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| So I appreciate y'all's help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10796)|
| 2:59:57| from your side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10797)|
| 2:59:57| and I'll go through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| through my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| as quick as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| I know it's been a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| y'all been on this a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| but I would like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| who the principal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| We think we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10810)|
| 3:00:10| We hope that that's who it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| but we don't really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10812)|
| 3:00:13| who they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| And what we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| brings issues into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10819)|
| 3:00:20| that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10820)|
| 3:00:21| And some of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| The first is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| The infrastructure does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| efficiently accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| the traffic there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| And it will not support perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| maybe up to a thousand jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10831)|
| 3:00:32| tractor trailer trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| delivery trucks coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| and going all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10836)|
| 3:00:37| There's a noise issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| for the people close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| Trucks make a lot of noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| and that's a 24 hour operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| And that's going to directly affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| our 250 families at Easttown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| Plus there's 15 or 20 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10850)|
| 3:00:54| to the west of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| Let's see, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10859)|
| 3:01:09| The residents at the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| there will have to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| with the traffic much more so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| than a lot of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10878)|
| 3:01:24| To prevent to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10884)|
| 3:01:25| into their apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10885)|
| 3:01:26| they have to not only negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| the traffic around that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| but they have to get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10889)|
| 3:01:30| to the road around the mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| and to enter access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| into the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| And that's kind of true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10896)|
| 3:01:37| for all of the other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10899)|
| 3:01:39| I know that retail likes traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| but too much traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| which could possibly cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| their customers to go elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| There is some question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| of light pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| for us at the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| It's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10914)|
| 3:01:54| I know it's not a big issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10914)|
| 3:01:55| but it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| And I know that this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| is what the developer wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| and it works good for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| but there are other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10927)|
| 3:02:08| I kind of tried to skip through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| because you all touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10929)|
| 3:02:10| on a lot of what I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10931)|
| 3:02:12| but I would like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10932)|
| 3:02:13| that there is a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10933)|
| 3:02:14| for zoning laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10934)|
| 3:02:17| And that most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| and among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| is to protect the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10942)|
| 3:02:22| And you commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| or the ladies and gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| interested with this duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| So what I would like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| is if we can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10952)|
| 3:02:32| a planned development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10955)|
| 3:02:35| The infrastructure is not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| to be able to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10956)|
| 3:02:37| with their construction timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| It's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10960)|
| 3:02:43| But what I would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| is I would hope for a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10967)|
| 3:02:48| If we can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| I would like to ask the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| if they would postpone this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| until we get more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| particularly on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10978)|
| 3:03:00| And if they can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10980)|
| 3:03:01| then I would ask you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10981)|
| 3:03:02| to vote no on this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10982)|
| 3:03:07| So I thank you for letting me talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| I didn't get to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| all I was going to say at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| but a lot of it's been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| But I do appreciate you listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10994)|
| 3:03:15| And I hope you will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10995)|
| 3:03:16| the whole community into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| There's a lot of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| and investment around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| I know this is a nice investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11003)|
| 3:03:24| but we also need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| not just the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11007)|
| 3:03:28| but all of the investments in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| and how the traffic impacts them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11010)|
| 3:03:32| Anyway, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11012)|
| 3:03:33| I'll let you all continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11013)|
| 3:03:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11016)|
| 3:03:37| Before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| Commissioner Hooten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11019)|
| 3:03:40| you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| I was going to make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| that Mr. Smith made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11025)|
| 3:03:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| Miss Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| I just wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| that I entered this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| thinking that I definitely wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| to go with a planned development scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11035)|
| 3:04:00| But from listening to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| that has presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| and I think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| and especially Deputy Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| I think that some of the safety precautions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| that have been put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11051)|
| 3:04:12| for this particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| to make sure that it does not stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| if the property changes hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| or if the project doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11058)|
| 3:04:20| We have a mechanism to turn it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| to its originals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| I mean, that makes me feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11062)|

| 3:14:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11691)|
| 3:14:52| I have driven out to the site and I'm very concerned about the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11692)|
| 3:14:56| It's on the, it probably will be at the top of an extremely steep and narrow road with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11696)|
| 3:15:04| visibility curtailed both to the right and to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| And I would like to ask Transportation if they have any opinions regarding the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11708)|
| 3:15:13| of that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| I know the lot is required to be provided an opportunity to access, but I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11715)|
| 3:15:21| about the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| This would be a question for City Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| Is that who you're asking, Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11727)|
| 3:15:33| Yes, I don't believe that anybody leaving the site would have good visibility to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11733)|

| 3:15:43| Who you're asking, Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| Yes, I don't believe that anybody leaving the site would have good visibility to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11746)|

| 3:15:55| Okay, David McGinley is on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| During the review, we would make sure that they have adequate site distance on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11759)|
| 3:16:05| The plan and the driveway location could not be approved without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11765)|
| 3:16:09| If they have to do improvements to either the roadway or the site to achieve that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11769)|
| 3:16:14| distance, that would be required at the plan's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| And what would be the natures of those improvements if it was required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11778)|
| 3:16:24| It could be removing vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| It could be grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| It could be rebuilding sections of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11788)|
| 3:16:33| They can achieve site distance in various number of ways, but certainly those are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11793)|
| 3:16:39| listed in the order of magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11799)|
| 3:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11803)|

| 3:16:54| Yes, I just wanted to point out within the staff report that there's a slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11814)|
| 3:17:01| that says that only 4.52 acres of the 65 acres can be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11821)|
| 3:17:09| Is that correct, staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11829)|
| 3:17:13| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| That's what we will be looking for when they go to submit for a building permit or a grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11836)|
| 3:17:23| permit through the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11843)|
| 3:17:24| It will come through the HP overlay COA process and we'll review the plan at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11844)|
| 3:17:32| It would be a level one review as long as they can commit to staying under or at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11852)|
| 3:17:37| 4.5 acres of disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11857)|
| 3:17:41| If they need to do more than that, they will have the ability to go through a level two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11861)|
| 3:17:46| review and that would come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=11866)|

| 3:22:52| Yes, this is Ryan Hickey with Ball Homes, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12172)|
| 3:22:59| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| We would like to request approval per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| The recommendation is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| and the surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| I'd like to keep the rest of our time for any further conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12191)|
| 3:23:17| Thank you, Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12197)|
| 3:23:20| Commissioner Corbett, you have your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12200)|
| 3:23:24| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12204)|
| 3:23:25| I have a number of questions that I'd like to address first to Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12205)|
| 3:23:30| I see that the zone that you're requesting is planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12210)|
| 3:23:35| and I have been out on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12215)|
| 3:23:38| I can't say I've walked it, but it seemed pretty flat to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| And I'd like to know, since the purpose of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12222)|
| 3:23:46| is to give you flexibility in your design due to environmental constraint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12226)|
| 3:23:52| what is your identified environmental constraint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12232)|
| 3:23:59| Out on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| there is an area of concern that is a possible sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| and we have hired a geotechnical engineering firm to perform an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| evaluation of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| So they will be doing that in the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12253)|
| 3:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| Another question is would perhaps the engineer could address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12258)|
| 3:24:24| There were several concerns about extending the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12264)|
| 3:24:28| long blue grass toward the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12268)|
| 3:24:31| and there was also concern about some extreme stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12271)|
| 3:24:38| And I was wondering if the development would help mitigate that existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12278)|
| 3:24:43| stormwater problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| So I want to ask about, can we require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| or is required to have sidewalk extending past the front of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12288)|
| 3:24:53| It's only 195 feet to some of the adjoining so that we have safety for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12293)|
| 3:24:58| school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| And is the applicant able to mitigate some of the existing problems of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12300)|
| 3:25:05| stormwater runoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12305)|
| 3:25:12| Our engineer would certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12312)|
| 3:25:14| civil engineer that will be designing this site would certainly evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12314)|
| 3:25:19| runoff that comes across this property and design it appropriately to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12319)|
| 3:25:26| handle the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12326)|
| 3:25:29| As far as the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12329)|
| 3:25:32| this property is located in the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12332)|
| 3:25:36| And we would be required to put sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12336)|
| 3:25:43| I'm not sure where the sidewalks will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| That would be determined by, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| MPC staff and the engineering staff through the concept plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12351)|
| 3:25:58| Yes, but what I'm trying to address is the fact that we had an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12358)|
| 3:26:03| stormwater problem and the codes require that you simply not exceed what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| the existing are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| And I also don't know who put in the sidewalks along bluegrass that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12371)|
| 3:26:16| off the frontage of your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12376)|
| 3:26:19| I don't know if this engineer could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12379)|
| 3:26:25| We don't have our engineers not on the call today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| I'm at the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12390)|
| 3:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| Yes, Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| We would require sidewalks along the frontage of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12396)|
| 3:26:41| And this would probably be a good location for us to look into making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| that connection down to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12404)|
| 3:26:47| Something maybe we'd partner with the developer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12407)|
| 3:26:51| And what about the existing stormwater flooding that the neighbors have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12411)|
| 3:26:55| reported?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12415)|
| 3:26:58| This is only a rezoning, so we would address that at the conceptual stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| We've not seen what they're even proposing yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12421)|
| 3:27:05| We're just in the rezoning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| They would have to meet our stormwater ordinance of pre and post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| development flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12429)|
| 3:27:14| Is this something that if in meeting the existing pre and post stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12434)|
| 3:27:19| flow, you find the neighborhood does have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| Would this be a project the County engineer would take on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12442)|
| 3:27:30| Well, if there is a sinkhole on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12450)|
| 3:27:32| they would have to address the volume of water, not only peak flow rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12452)|
| 3:27:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12459)|
| 3:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12463)|

| 3:28:04| Recommendation for approving for dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| And I wondered about that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12487)|
| 3:28:12| I'm not sure if I'm hearing this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12492)|
| 3:28:15| They all have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| One to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12497)|
| 3:28:20| Dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12500)|
| 3:28:30| Yes. So actually if you zoom out, there's quite a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12510)|
| 3:28:33| We don't just look at the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| We look at the general area around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| Cause it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12517)|
| 3:28:38| it's a three and a half, three and a half, three and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| And then on the other side of Ebeneezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| I don't know that that would really count those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| Cause that's on the other side of Ebeneezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| but there's a five and a four right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12527)|
| 3:28:57| But really it's just kind of looking at that three and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| three and a half, three and five. And that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| that general area right around the parcel itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| that kind of drove our decision to support the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| The second question is about the road widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12548)|
| 3:29:13| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12553)|
| 3:29:17| There was a project that we, as a commission looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12557)|
| 3:29:21| Last meeting or a couple of meetings ago where the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| Was responsible for widening the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12564)|
| 3:29:29| And we asked the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12569)|
| 3:29:33| Planning staff about why in this development was the developer doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12573)|
| 3:29:38| that. And then others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| They aren't required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| And the answer is that it's really kind of a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| Every situation is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| And I wondered about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12586)|
| 3:29:48| If the developer is being asked to help with that road widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12588)|
| 3:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12593)|
| 3:29:54| So that would be a question for the engineering staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12594)|
| 3:29:58| Is there someone from the engineering department that could chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| Yeah, this is Jim stone, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12601)|
| 3:30:04| Mr. Adams. We, once again, obviously this is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12604)|
| 3:30:08| So we'll look at that as far as concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12608)|
| 3:30:10| And look to see what the road with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| but my initial impression would be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| Bluegrass road should be sufficiently wide enough to accommodate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| traffic, but we'll certainly look at it and verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12618)|
| 3:30:22| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12622)|
| 3:30:25| Seeing no other comments terrible entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12625)|
| 3:30:29| I'd like to make a motion to approve the rezone to PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12629)|
| 3:30:33| but up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| I'd second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12635)|
| 3:30:40| We have a motion by commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| Second by commissioner Adams to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12642)|
| 3:30:46| Motion to approve the rezone plan residential up to three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12650)|
| 3:30:56| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12656)|
| 3:30:57| Commissioner graph. You have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12659)|
| 3:31:05| I spent 50 years looking at developments and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12665)|
| 3:31:09| Three to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12669)|
| 3:31:10| Is very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12670)|
| 3:31:15| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12675)|
| 3:31:16| When you get to four, it might be a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12676)|
| 3:31:19| And five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| Is definitely, you can tell the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12683)|
| 3:31:28| I don't, I don't see any problem with going to four here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| It's not going to change very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12694)|
| 3:31:36| We just don't get three to the acre anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| With.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12698)|

| 3:31:45| They just need more. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| I'm in favor of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| Four to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| Thank you. Commissioner graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| Chair recognizes commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12713)|
| 3:31:56| I was going to say the exact same thing that commissioner graph did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12716)|

| 3:32:02| And there, there is a sinkhole you have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12722)|
| 3:32:05| There's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12725)|
| 3:32:06| there's a very few small amount of lots that you can get out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12726)|

| 3:32:11| there's a lot of cost on this one up and it's an extremely desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=12731)|

| 3:39:46| Mr. Sharpe, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| Or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13188)|
| 3:39:50| I would prefer the opposition go first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13190)|
| 3:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| Ms. McElmore, your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13194)|
| 3:39:57| and you have up to five minutes to speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| My name is Nancy McElmore, and I live at 324 Breakbill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13200)|
| 3:40:11| And this property, it's not that we're against any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13211)|
| 3:40:16| but Breakbill Road, there was a development in the making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13216)|
| 3:40:21| a couple of years ago, and it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13221)|
| 3:40:25| happen because of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13225)|
| 3:40:28| Breakbill Road runs from Nashville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13228)|
| 3:40:30| to Strawberry Plains Park, which that is the entrance to I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13230)|
| 3:40:37| Breakbill Road's just a few feet from that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13237)|
| 3:40:42| And the road, this will not take any more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13242)|
| 3:40:49| because the road is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13249)|
| 3:40:53| And the last time, the road, Knox County Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13253)|
| 3:40:56| was telling us that it is in plans to take care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13256)|
| 3:41:01| to widen the road, but it's like 200 down the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13261)|
| 3:41:07| before this will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| Part of the road's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13268)|
| 3:41:10| Part is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| The reason for that is any new development, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13273)|
| 3:41:16| is annexed for the tax purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13276)|
| 3:41:19| And at times, we almost need a traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13279)|
| 3:41:22| to get out of our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13282)|
| 3:41:25| And my husband's family's lived on this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13285)|
| 3:41:28| for over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| Of course, most of them have died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| but there still is several, three or four families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13291)|
| 3:41:34| that are still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13294)|
| 3:41:36| And we were just wondering, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13296)|
| 3:41:38| if the entrance to this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13298)|
| 3:41:40| was going to be on Breakbill Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13300)|
| 3:41:42| or was it going to be on Hammer Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| I know this development, there's been nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| It's just basically woods, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13308)|
| 3:41:51| a subdivision would be an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13311)|
| 3:41:54| But it's just that the road is so narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13314)|
| 3:41:56| and there's wrecks all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13316)|
| 3:41:59| In fact, one individual's even been killed on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13319)|
| 3:42:03| So they do pave it and keep it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13323)|
| 3:42:08| but the pavement has got so high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13328)|
| 3:42:10| that people just run off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13330)|
| 3:42:13| And they've killed like three of our trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| and hit telephone poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| So the road is just really narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| For a while, we're not letting trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13340)|
| 3:42:23| even come down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13343)|
| 3:42:24| but because of all the developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13344)|
| 3:42:27| they do allow the big tractor trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| which one cannot pass another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| And across Asheville Highway at the end of Breakbill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13353)|
| 3:42:37| there is a new, big new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| that's going in over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13359)|
| 3:42:40| which Breakbill Road will be used more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| because our road goes directly to get on I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13363)|
| 3:42:50| And that's all that I have to say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| Thank you, Ms. McLemore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13372)|
| 3:42:54| Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13374)|
| 3:42:57| Yeah, I'm sure some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13377)|
| 3:42:58| or all of you recall this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13378)|
| 3:43:02| was presented a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13382)|
| 3:43:05| Make it roughly 900 units on 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13385)|
| 3:43:10| My client, he's opted to scale it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13390)|
| 3:43:14| just to a detached, well, a mixture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| of attached and detached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13397)|
| 3:43:19| I think we're roughly 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13399)|
| 3:43:23| And we are being required to widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13403)|
| 3:43:26| or to make improvements to Breakbill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13406)|
| 3:43:29| and to hammer to the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13409)|
| 3:43:32| the subdivision entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13412)|
| 3:43:33| And we've had several discussions with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13413)|
| 3:43:37| So we'll be working out the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| for those during permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13419)|
| 3:43:43| We really don't, I don't have any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13423)|
| 3:43:46| to the bulk of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13426)|
| 3:43:47| I would ask for a little more clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| on what offsite improvements are gonna be required, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13430)|
| 3:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13436)|
| 3:44:01| Engineering, are you available to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13441)|
| 3:44:04| to Mr. Sharp's request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13444)|
| 3:44:10| Oh yeah, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13450)|
| 3:44:11| This is Jim Snowden with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| Yeah, we've been working actually with Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13453)|
| 3:44:16| and the city engineering folks today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13456)|
| 3:44:19| to clarify that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13459)|
| 3:44:22| I think we may need some of your all's guidance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13462)|
| 3:44:26| The county, obviously, to Chris's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13466)|
| 3:44:28| or Mr. Sharp's point, that the county does want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| the road widened to at least 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13470)|
| 3:44:34| but we would look at it on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13474)|
| 3:44:37| But in addition to the sidewalk improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13477)|
| 3:44:41| the county, per our sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| would prefer to have sidewalks along the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13484)|
| 3:44:47| of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| However, I think there is some question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| once the development gets to the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13491)|
| 3:44:56| whether or not the city has a mechanism in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13496)|
| 3:44:58| to require that extension to Strawberry Plains Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13498)|
| 3:45:02| We would be in support of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13502)|
| 3:45:04| just because of the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13504)|
| 3:45:05| from the two or 300 lots here down to that commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13505)|
| 3:45:10| But I'm not sure the city has a mechanism to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| So we would look for your all's guidance on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| just because of the city's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13517)|
| 3:45:20| with their sidewalk mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13520)|
| 3:45:23| Mr. Snowden, the distance from the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13523)|
| 3:45:27| to the city limits, how many, about a quarter of a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13527)|
| 3:45:31| No, and I may have to get some assistance here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13531)|
| 3:45:35| with the city, but I think it's very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13535)|
| 3:45:41| Our property is contiguous to city right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13541)|
| 3:45:47| Mr. Cannon, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13547)|
| 3:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| This is David McGinley, I think Harold had to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13556)|
| 3:45:57| The city certainly wouldn't stand in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13557)|
| 3:46:00| of additional sidewalks required by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13560)|
| 3:46:03| but that's not typically something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13563)|
| 3:46:04| that the city can require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13564)|
| 3:46:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13570)|
| 3:46:11| But we'll support what the county requires, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13571)|
| 3:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13574)|
| 3:46:17| Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13577)|
| 3:46:20| Yes, I had just a few questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13580)|
| 3:46:22| but my first question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13582)|
| 3:46:24| is the extension of the sidewalk into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13584)|
| 3:46:27| is that something that the Planning Commission can require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13587)|
| 3:46:36| Ms. Brooks, would you like to comment, or staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13596)|
| 3:46:40| Certainly, I can comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13600)|
| 3:46:42| Yes, this is an instance where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13602)|
| 3:46:44| the Planning Commission could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13604)|
| 3:46:46| in the county, they have a very specific policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13606)|
| 3:46:51| in terms of sidewalks and the location of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13611)|
| 3:46:56| that you all are aware of, but in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13616)|
| 3:46:59| it is something that you all could consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13619)|
| 3:47:02| especially with the city saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13622)|
| 3:47:03| that they would be in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13623)|
| 3:47:09| Okay, I had a couple other questions for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13629)|
| 3:47:14| One is, I was looking at the variance for the triplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13634)|
| 3:47:21| the lot with variance, and I wanted to ask the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13641)|
| 3:47:24| if they actually felt that entire lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13644)|
| 3:47:28| from what I could see, is only going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13648)|
| 3:47:30| about 15 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13650)|
| 3:47:33| Am I looking at the site plan incorrectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13653)|
| 3:47:38| Give me just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13658)|
| 3:47:40| Give me just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13660)|
| 3:47:46| I didn't do that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13666)|
| 3:48:02| Ma'am, it's wider than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13682)|
| 3:48:07| I think the narrowest lot is 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13687)|
| 3:48:10| If I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13690)|
| 3:48:12| Narrowest lot in that triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13692)|
| 3:48:17| So that middle lot is 20 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13697)|
| 3:48:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13703)|
| 3:48:24| My next question was the terminus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13704)|
| 3:48:26| southern terminus of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13706)|
| 3:48:29| I see it feeds into, is that a detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| or retention pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13711)|
| 3:48:34| Actually, it terminates into what has been determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13714)|
| 3:48:37| as being a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| So we've established, that is actually a spring head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13720)|
| 3:48:46| And it basically, that's the origin of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13726)|
| 3:48:48| and it travels to where that cursor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13728)|
| 3:48:50| That's a delineated wetland that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13730)|
| 3:48:54| we're maintaining buffers around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13734)|
| 3:48:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13739)|
| 3:49:00| Yeah, we're trying to disturb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13740)|
| 3:49:05| Last question was, I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| the parking lot shown off of road E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13747)|
| 3:49:11| what's the thinking, I like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| but what's the thinking behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13753)|
| 3:49:17| It's typically when you have cluster homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| or when you have attached units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13759)|
| 3:49:22| there's not an opportunity to park in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13762)|
| 3:49:26| for guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13766)|
| 3:49:27| So that's basically overflow parking for cookouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13770)|
| 3:49:34| Well, I wish more applicants would provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| for the cluster housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13777)|
| 3:49:38| I think it's a swell idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13778)|
| 3:49:46| I guess back to the sidewalk issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13786)|
| 3:49:53| how are we going to resolve that, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13793)|
| 3:49:55| And that, you know, my concern is if it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13795)|
| 3:49:59| and I'm pro sidewalk, but if it is constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13799)|
| 3:50:02| you get people to the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13802)|
| 3:50:04| or Brakefield and Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13804)|
| 3:50:05| then, you know, kind of, then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| It's a four lane divided highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13807)|
| 3:50:12| and people drive pretty, pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13812)|
| 3:50:14| So there's something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13814)|
| 3:50:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13819)|
| 3:50:20| Thank you, Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13820)|
| 3:50:21| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| I just wanted to comment that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| seeing that the southwest corner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| that's been the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13828)|
| 3:50:31| has a large section of that that is left as undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13831)|
| 3:50:34| and that there is a potential unpaved trail system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13834)|
| 3:50:38| planned for that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13838)|
| 3:50:39| So I appreciate seeing that from the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13839)|
| 3:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13843)|

| 3:52:51| I believe it's Crosswood Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13971)|
| 3:52:54| that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13974)|
| 3:52:57| I could ask a staff, the site plan I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13977)|
| 3:53:00| doesn't show how far it is from the highway itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13980)|
| 3:53:07| What is that distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=13987)|

| 3:59:17| Can we have one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14357)|
| 3:59:18| Yeah, she said we've got one more item, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14358)|
| 3:59:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14361)|
| 3:59:22| Sorry, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| Hopefully this won't take too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14364)|
| 3:59:26| So yes, we have agenda item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14366)|
| 3:59:32| And I will, if you want me to briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14372)|
| 3:59:34| I can briefly talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14374)|
| 3:59:35| And I apologize for sending it to you just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14375)|
| 3:59:40| But hopefully you all have had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14380)|
| 3:59:43| But in our planning descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14383)|
| 3:59:45| which is an internal document that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14385)|
| 3:59:46| use to document all of our positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14386)|
| 3:59:50| here at the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| And it does require that any major modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14392)|
| 3:59:57| to that document come before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14397)|
| 4:00:00| And so we are asking to modify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| The executive director has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| to hire, fire, discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14404)|
| 4:00:08| And we just think this is a very administrative function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14408)|
| 4:00:12| We also have a human resources consultant on board now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14412)|
| 4:00:16| and who is reviewing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14416)|
| 4:00:17| And it just makes it a little less cumbersome to update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14417)|
| 4:00:22| And her advice to us has been, you should keep this updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14422)|
| 4:00:26| Don't sit on it for very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14426)|
| 4:00:27| You should be looking at this on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=14427)|
