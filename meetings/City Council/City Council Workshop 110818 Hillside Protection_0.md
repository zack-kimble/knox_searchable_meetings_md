| 0:10:50| Ed Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| We'll spend about no more than an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| probably fifty minutes or so, talking about slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| and then the second hour about talking about clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| That's acceptable, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| In terms of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| In the first session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| we established why it's an important conversation for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Overall, I heard it was a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| establishing a balance between having good business environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| environment, honoring property rights of individuals, while protecting the trees, land, and water that's the heart of East Tennessee and Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| Second session, we had a very good session, I believe. We established that under current state statutes, the process allows and may even require that citizens have the right to appeal any decision made by appointed boards like MPC or a zoning board to either the city council or the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=688)|
| 0:11:46| In other words, we understood and that's what the memo from legal confirmed for both the city and the county, that everyone has a right for those elected officials to respond and these elected bodies have the right to overturn any suggestion or decision made by the appointed boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=706)|
| 0:12:03| You'll notice in the back, I think I emailed you, but also gave you a paper copy of that decision. Dan, is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=723)|
| 0:12:13| Okay, got a nod yes. I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=733)|
| 0:12:24| They did say that this policy will amend the general plan of 2033 and will necessitate bringing current regulation in line that currently exists in line with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=744)|
| 0:12:35| However, according to them, nothing is written in stone and these policies can be interpreted by elected bodies if the MPC interpretation is not acceptable to an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=755)|
| 0:12:45| So that is what I understand that you guys had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Dan, is there anything from legal's point of view, is there anything you want to add to what I've said or want to clarify about the memo that's been out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=769)|
| 0:13:00| I don't think there's anything I need to clarify. However, I'm here for questions if there are any that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Right, at this time, do any of you have any questions of legal about what has been presented to you either by me or by someone else at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=784)|
| 0:13:14| Everybody comfortable with that? Great, well he's here and we can definitely refer to him at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| August 9th, I met with individuals in 30 minute increments from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. here representing various constituencies and interested in the outcome of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=800)|
| 0:13:39| I thought all the individuals very articulate, they were all very passionate if you can believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Most of them were really, really nice and we had a great conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Most, if not all, were very courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| The following groups were represented, they represented the following groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I'm not going to name who all was there, but I thought it would be interesting for you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| We had representatives of the League of Women Voters, representatives of the Tea Party, the Homeowners Associations, landowners, developers, and I think it was also representing builders at that point, the environmental community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=841)|
| 0:14:12| Members of the task force represented the soil science community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| I thought a very broad, good representation of people in the community and they were able to come in and say this is what we think about it and this is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=856)|
| 0:14:24| You'll notice on the first page of your notes, I think the markings make it even more confusing, but it says three and green, pages three and four and green are the summary of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=864)|
| 0:14:43| I won't spend much time on it, but I want to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| There's no way to adequately, you can imagine the amount of information that was handed to me during that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| But I think these bullet points summarize the concerns on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| You've heard them before, but I want to clarify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| There is a belief, those opposed to the plan, that the council and commission should leave the current policies in place and enforce the requirements and policies rather than develop new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=901)|
| 0:15:11| There's concern about violating owners' property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| They should manage their land without undue governmental interference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| There was concern the new policies will lower property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| There was the statement that existing structures in town violate this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| They've been no problem with those structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Why should we then worry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Others talked about what they perceived to be a poor notification process of affected parties, that people should be given better notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| Others felt like it gave too much control of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| The process of approval was unclear in this policy, was the belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| That the plan significantly expanded the amount of land under regulation, that concerned some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| That the plan took away the power of the professional developers to clear and grade as they saw fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| The current policy is not as clearly and tightly defined and allows some flexibility for developers and builders as they saw fit, and they saw that as a positive rather than taking that away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=962)|
| 0:16:13| Some believed the county would be hurting their tax base by limiting building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Others thought the policy was too ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| They thought ordinances should be described by elected officials and not left to MPC for interpretation, was their belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| And finally, there were at least a couple groups questioned the legal terms of slope and ridgetops, that it wasn't clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| And they thought perhaps the county, the city, and MPC might even have different policies in terms of ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| That would summarize the concerns against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| The concerns for were equally articulate and I thought well presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| They said this is page four marked in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| This policy will increase property values because planned development will occur that's more environmentally friendly with planned green spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1014)|
| 0:17:02| That the property rights below, and others believed the property rights below the elevated land of those who live below the elevated land must be considered also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1022)|
| 0:17:11| The victims of flooding and sliding have a right to protect their land bags and property lights just like those on elevated land masses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| I believe this statement was made, but I checked and that may be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| One person stated there's been plenty of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| The task force hosted 13 community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I read nine, but that was what was stated to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| The enforcement of new policy must take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| This document doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| There was a concern that even though it is supported, if it is not enforced, it's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| Their statement about slope, which we'll talk about tonight, is their understanding was the slope requirements were almost the same as the current slope requirements in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| And the current plan only deviates by adding requirements above 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Another stated this document is a policy that allows individuals to appeal to legislative bodies if they disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| It doesn't give NPC too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Another group stated the policy sets forth formulas for regulating clearing and grading where there's been no enforcement or understood expectation for clearing grading in the county in the past at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1091)|
| 0:18:21| This standard is important because storm water runoff is causing flooding problems and must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| It was brought to my attention that current EPA standards mandate that the first inch of rainwater must not run off a development at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1108)|
| 0:18:38| And this plan puts practices into place that address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| So there's concerns whether we're dealing properly with EPA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| And someone else said this plan wasn't much longer and no more complicated than the tree conservation plan that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| I think they said it was 68 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| And they were concerned that the argument that the tree policy plan which is in place is not any more complicated or convoluted than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| And finally somebody pointed out I think from the NPC that the GIS markings of the designated areas are now much better than the hand drawn markings before and they thought that was a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1148)|
| 0:19:20| So that kind of summarizes what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| I don't know if that answers all of our questions but I think it's fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| And I think it helps us as we move that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Any comments or questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I don't want to spend too much time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| And I just told you what they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| I'm not going to argue fact at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| It's just I just share a perception with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| We good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Good with your history of what you learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Do you understand what they said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Yes, that does not necessarily cover the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| All I gave you is what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| And I wanted you to know what those representative groups said to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| And I probably I didn't write down everything everybody said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| I am sure there's somebody out there right now who's saying you know he didn't mention what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| But I gave you I think which is the good cross section of what came from the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you for helping me clarify that Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Let's begin our discussion about the topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1225)|
| 0:20:42| The way we're going to do this is we will clarify kind of clarify what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| We're going to discuss the key issues involved in each of these slope clearing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| I won't really separate density out as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| It becomes part of the slope and clearing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| But it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| And then we'll analyze kind of strengths and weaknesses kind of on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| And then we'll be able to clarify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| And then we'll talk about options for how to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| How do we meet interests of most groups and stay at the heart of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| You saw I put up here I just for help this this is not meant to be comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| It's meant to be a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| I put on the wall this was taken this particular documents were taken directly from the NPC site where the facts and questions section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1281)|
| 0:21:35| And this is what is being proposed to the public as the facts in terms of slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| General plan 2033 section 76 says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| This is the plan that's currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| It says 7.6 to reclaim our rights to clean and air water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| It says one restrict development on slopes greater than 15% and along streams and rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Housing densities on 15 to 25% slopes are two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| Housing densities on slopes greater than 25% one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| Non-residential uses on slopes over 15% via a planned development zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| And flood plains limit uses to 50% in a flood fringe area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| That's the policy that's currently in place as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| You have then within the plan policies that can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| That is page, I believe it's page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Well it's page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Slope comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| What I want to do before we start the discussion is straight up compare the two policies so you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| I think it's important to kind of cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| There may be a question I'm going to have to ask NPC to qualify because it seemed like I saw two different statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| but I'm sure it's my lack of understanding, not any kind of mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Here we notice it says comparison one, slopes of less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| Any use allowed of property zoning base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| However, where's Mark at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Mark, I don't know if you can answer this, step up and answer this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I also saw in the plan it said property less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I believe it said six dwellings per acre within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Can you kind of tell the difference between that statement of any use plus six dwellings per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| With regard to residential uses and we then look at the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| and the urban growth area versus the plan growth area, city versus county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| So generally in the city or in the urban growth area we will use six units per acre as that base to apply to areas less than 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1434)|
| 0:24:05| And in the plan growth areas in the county we will use five units per acre as the maximum to apply to that area below 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1445)|
| 0:24:15| And so the statement of any use allowed is probably not as particularly accurate as that statement, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| The uses certainly are allowed, but any density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Density allowed, I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| I just want to make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| So the use can be as, but the density as you see right there under slope is within the county five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| I'm not sure we got that right up there, is that correct Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And within the city six units per acre, which isn't a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| And the 15 to 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Can you repeat that one more time about the density in city and county and the difference between the current regulations and the proposed plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Mark, why don't you say it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Okay, let's just deal with that area less than 15% slope that would happen to be within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1501)|
| 0:25:10| There is a significant chunk of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| If it's in the city and it's classified as low density residential, we will assign up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1513)|
| 0:25:23| In the county, if it's classified as low density residential, we will assign up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| And then there are some areas where the land use plan is calling for medium density residential within the HRPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| And in the city, we use up to 24 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| In the county, we use up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Again, that's for that base area below 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| And there is no change from what I understand from the NPC, there's no change below 15% within the current policy and the new policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Does that help Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| There is no change between current policy and new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| On less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Commissioner, if you would put your microphone down when you're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| I want to make sure everybody hears what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Yes, there's no change, but I think some of these clearing and grading plans is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| That's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| We're talking slope only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Slope only is all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| There's a significant difference in clearing and grading, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| But in terms of slope only, that's our topic at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Slope only, there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| You mean slope as it affects density is what you're really talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Slope affects grading and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| But slope in terms of density at this point is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| We'll separately talk about clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It's difficult, Councilman, because they all interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And yet trying to sort them out to talk is an interesting conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Slopes between 15% and 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Once again, if I understand this correctly, there's not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Residential use is up to two dwellings per acre, with various policies being adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| for limited office, medium density, commercial uses, including the technology corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| and residential use up to two dwellings per acre with limited office density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| and commercial use on hillside areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Now in terms of the commercial, there may be some change on that in terms of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| I'll go back to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I want to talk about residential and low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| There's no change at 15 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| In terms of medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| The plan recommends that, yeah, there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| The plan recommends the development of medium density housing on slopes less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| So you need to see that in terms of development, the plan recommends only less than 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| on commercial or medium density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| So everybody somewhat clear on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| Doug, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| On the 15 to 25, I see medium density in both black and blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1699)|
| 0:28:31| What was just said about medium density then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| These factors are used in calculating an overall density budget for a proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| So if a parcel comes in for a rezoning, we would recommend planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| and then we would prepare a density recommendation using these factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| We will use for the base, for that area of the property that's less than 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| we will use those base numbers that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| We will also assign in the 15 to 25% slope range a density factor of two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1752)|
| 0:29:21| regardless of whether the project is medium density or low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| So they will get credit for some units on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| The plan recommends that we put those units on the flat parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| but they would get credit for units for land that has that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| That is unchanged from current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| So clarify this for me, because I'm slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| I'm probably the slowest person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| So you're telling me that even though it's listed that there can be limited office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| and minimum density commercial on hillsides, you're saying you're recommending that not take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| but you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| There's an opportunity that may take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| The plan recommends that if you're going to do it in that slope area, do it with small footprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| and use tuck under garage to minimize the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So there is a – at what I hear you saying then, at the residential level there's no change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| but at the medium density there are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| The recommendation is not to build there, but if they do, there are certain ways they can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| Current policy speaks to medium density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1830)|
| 0:30:42| The proposed policy may be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| I think the current policy is quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| There's no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| The location of medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| So this is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| So the medium density would be different because it is now discussed where in the past it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| It recommends the use of smaller footprints and tuck under parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| So on the limited office, on the medium density and commercial use, that has changed from current practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| Yeah, that would be a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| So there's been that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I was about to call Commissioner Anders and I realized that Brad was there, so that's nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Oh, is Brad there too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| I'll be both of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| So there is no change for residential, but the change for commercial and limited office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1896)|
| 0:31:48| the only change is that it makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| And keep in mind that of the 130,000 plus or minus acres in the proposed hillside and rooftop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| about 98% of it has low density or rural residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| So you're talking about about 2% of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| This is a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| And what you're saying is it hasn't been addressed before, and now it's being addressed at a level of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| And it is a change, as Commissioner Owenby said, but I wanted to clarify what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Yeah, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I had just one question, and I'll probably ask this about each of these and each one of the things that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| But you said that in medium density, if they were, for instance, wanting to put an office or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| they would have to design it differently, or it would be recommended that they design it differently than what they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| But my question really deals with, you know, I'll call it special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| Would they have the right to appeal that, depending on the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| either to the BZA or to the county commission to say there's certain things about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| Yes, it's, you know, because it doesn't fall into the definition that the MPC has to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| but we feel that there's special circumstances here because of the surrounding slope, the soil type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| You know, there's probably a dozen reasons that could come up that we can't think of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| They would have the right to appeal that, either to the county commission or to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| to allow it to proceed the same way it would now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| And this is sort of a legal question, too, is that how binding is this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| How inflexible is it or how flexible is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| But what happens when someone thinks they have a good plan, but yet it would be rejected by the plan the way it stands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2023)|
| 0:33:54| That issue is addressed in several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| One, in the event that somebody already has a land-use classification and zoning that allows office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| or medium-density residential without plan review, the MPC is out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| They go directly to permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| In the case where they are proposing a change in the plan or a change in the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| then MPC is in the position of making a recommendation to the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| So the legislative body is the final arbiter of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| And then, in the plan, there is a recommendation for the creation of special commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| and office districts when there are locational or environmental criteria where that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2078)|
| 0:34:47| So that would support the change in the land-use plan as well as the change in the zoning to support commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2087)|
| 0:34:56| or office or medium-density residential uses in particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| So you come down talking to somebody like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| It sounds like what you're saying is that when the commissioner says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| can they appeal it to BZA and or the commission, you're saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I guess let me say the one I'm trying to address are some of these bullet points on page three that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| It says this is one of the complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| We heard this again and again and again, that this plan gives too much control to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| And, I mean, even if the Planning Commission is following it all down, we have the professional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| then we have the MPC itself votes on this, they would have the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I mean, even if it's denied, just flat out denied by the MPC because it doesn't meet any of these criteria that you had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| they can't have the special circumstances, they can't do this, they still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| and I'm sort of asking this to the legal people also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| they would have the right to still appeal this to the appropriate appellate board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| So, I mean, it may give a lot of power to the MPC, but they still have an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| The appeals process would kick in in the event that there is already in place a planned zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| which assigns development plan approval authority to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| That decision is appealable in the city to city council, in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| That's what I mean by the appropriate appellate board, whether it's the city council, county commission, or the BZAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| I've got to confirm that with Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| And also, I believe there's even statute that's come down recently that confirms that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Well, there have always been statutes that provide administrative appeals and then eventually and ultimately appeal to the courts of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| So, there won't ever be a land use decision that's not appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| That would be a violation of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| But decisions that come out of the MPC will be appealable either to the city council or the county commission and then eventually to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| So, there are several layers of administrative review and then eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Really, why I mention this is that I think most developers want to keep this out of the courts because things can be tied up for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| And if they have options on ‑‑ most of the time they have options on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| and they're not going to buy the land until they have the appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| But usually with the appeals that are made to the city council, the commission, or the various BZAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| that can be handled within a month or two, which still would fit into an economic timeline that they could deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| When it goes to the courts, it can be a year's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| And most of them would say if it's going to go to the courts, then they've lost because they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| So, to move us along, I want to confirm that we understand that they can appeal to the elected body if they're unhappy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| or feel like they have special circumstance with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| From what I see of the plan, it doesn't change the current method of appealing decisions from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| We're going to move along, but two more comments to Councilman DelBolte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| I want to be sure that Mr. Briggs' question is answered with a footnote that is clear in the Tennessee statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2286)|
| 0:38:17| which I have in front of me, TCA 133304B, the new B that's effective July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| says if the legislative body adopts the general regional plan in the form of an ordinance or a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| then any land use decisions thereafter made by the legislative body, the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| the Board of Zoning Appeals, and I'll skip some words, must be consistent with the general regional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| So, if the plan has a requirement as opposed to a fuzzy section, then you have to abide by the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| Where you appeal it to a court or whatever is fine, but the standard is in the state statute, which empowers all of us to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I wouldn't disagree with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| What's meant by fuzzy section of the plan or recommendation, whether it's a mandatory part of the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| or a recommendation, that depends on the language of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| And I agree that land use decisions that are made after the adoption of the general plan must be consistent with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| But I reiterate there are several layers of administrative review and appeal to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| or the county commission before that specific portion of the plan will be interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| and whether the decision is consistent with the plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| There's a level of interpretation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| So, if you're talking to a guy from Texas, which means I'm not that bright, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| So, what I hear you saying is any, because, you know, Councilman DelVolpe read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| but what I hear you saying, any can be appealed to the elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| Now, whether they change it or do whatever, they still have to be consistent with the plan, but the appeal is allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| I'm not taking away the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| I'm just saying it's the standard in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| It has to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| There's a plan is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| Then there are land use decisions that will be based on the plan that are made after the plan that must be consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Those decisions can be appealed through the administrative process and eventually ultimately to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| One more comment, Councilman Brown, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I just have a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| What we are looking at here, the current plan, is this a plan to both county and city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| The current plan, I believe, applies to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Real quick, I'm going to move through, because we'll talk more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| but also see that at the 25% to 40% range, residential uses are at one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| That doesn't change at residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| At 40% to 50% is a residential low-density change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Residential uses up to one dwelling per two acres is allowed currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| and now it's proposed it's one dwelling per four acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| and over 50% residential uses one dwelling per two acres and proposed as no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| and I believe Ridgetop has to be through a specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| We don't have that listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| We'll talk about Ridgetop later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| So that's the basics of that particular understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| As you can tell in this conversation, it just goes all kinds of directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Who am I asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Under slopes over 50%, I mean, I know this is just the synopsis version of these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2499)|
| 0:41:50| but if it says no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| it should also be stated that there is possible under special circumstances or special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2513)|
| 0:42:03| Is that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| On slopes over 50%, I believe everybody on the task force, regardless of their bent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| agreed that there ought not to be any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| and what that recommendation is saying is that when we prepare that budget of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| in making our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| we are going to give no credit for that portion of the property over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| Would you consider a driveway up to my flattop mountain development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| If that's the only way to reach a flat spot on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| then we have proposed in the plan smaller right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| and smaller street profiles to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| My understanding was there would be a special district for that type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| What do you call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| A hilltop district or something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| There was supposed to be a special district set up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| I mean, it had very serious and controlling rules and limitations, but it's not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:14| Well, if you're speaking about development on top of the ridge, which would be probably a flat spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| but accessible only through a steeply sloped portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| we would, through the use of the planned residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and the development plan approval, try to site the development on the flat part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| and minimize the disturbance to the steeply sloped portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| What are you able to build is driveway up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Yeah. If that's the only way to access that flat spot, then that's the way you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| Real quickly, let's talk a few minutes about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| When you see that slope, what is it you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| That's all we're going to talk about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| What is it you like about that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| What are you supportive of within this that we need to be thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| You're talking density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Well, slope and density, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| We're talking about the slope and density relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| What do you like about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| The slope part only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Slope density relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| There's no change except for the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| It's similar except very few changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| There are a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| We'll come to changes in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Do you want to add on something in support of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Is that pretty much what you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| There's very few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| It looks and feels a lot like what we've got already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| We've noted that there's flexibility within the plan that will allow for special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2701)|
| 0:45:14| If you have special circumstances, that can be built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Could you hit the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| There's a gradation of the amount of units that are allowed the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| the more density being allowed at the lower slopes and less at the higher ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| You like the idea of the density being further down the mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| I think it's sensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| That seems sensible to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Anything else about this slope density relationship that you want to bring forward to support it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| This really is sort of what Tony said about flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| There's an appeals process for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| Anyone else want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| It sounds like coming in, you are fairly consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| It looks and feels a whole lot like what we've already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| There are some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| But within those changes, some of you say you like the flexibility, you like the ability to appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| and at least one of you or some of you like the idea of the density being pushed down to the flatter parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| and there's gradation going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Whereas in the current plan, there's only two gradations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| There's below a certain point and above a certain point, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| And you like the gradation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| We'll make sure we kind of get those on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| Well, let's talk about what concerns you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Some of that has come up already, but I want you to restate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| and restate it as succinctly as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| What is it about this slope-density relationship that concerns you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Basically, it's sound, but there is this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| It is possible with good engineering to come up with a plan that doesn't fit that mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| I don't know if there's that much flexibility in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| So, for example, if the criteria were specified, you know, with some precision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| what you had to achieve in terms of you could only clear so much of the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| or you could only do certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| you might come up with a density that's higher or more intense than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| and yet still be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| But I don't see that as really allowed under here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| So some of the flexibility may be taken out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| In other words, good engineering could come up with a different perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| than the rigid rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| And see, what I hear you saying is you understand flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| You have questions about how flexible it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| I don't want to say something you're not saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| That would be the concern here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Is it flexible enough if someone comes in and they engineer something really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| and it makes sense but it violates the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| They engineer it and they have low profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| You can't see it under ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| They run the roads with the contour of the hill and not against them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| so there's less runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| They've used materials that blend in and look like the forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| They're in greens and tans and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| They've done the things that minimize the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| and yet it would seem to me that the density is absolute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| that you really can't propose that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| You might as well just scratch it because you're not going to get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| So you have some loss of flexibility as a tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| So you're asking about your concern about just enough flexibility for good engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Any other concerns about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Can you expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| I don't think one plan fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Every piece of property is uniquely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| And your concern is that this doesn't address that variety of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| That's where you need that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2950)|
| 0:49:20| Mark, are you wanting to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| The plan addresses that flexibility in a couple of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| in that it provides for density bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| It recommends the provision of density bonuses for certain performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| particularly the setting aside of land in undisturbed condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| and then also making it accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| But in the case that Nick was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| if someone had a plan such as that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| and came in for a rezoning request with the plan in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| and it met all of the land use plan criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| I suspect that there would be a good chance of getting the zoning approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| to make that plan happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| Currently, with planned development zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| it's done in a two-step process where they simply get the zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| and we provide the maximum density in step one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| and then the development plan comes at a much later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| If someone had a plan in hand when they made the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| and it performed like Nick was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| I would say that the chances of getting that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| as long as it was consistent with the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| which is either ag and rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| for most of the hillside and ridgetop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| one unit to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| or with the planned growth and low-density residential standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| So what I hear you saying is you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| with having flexibility in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| we'll talk about this more in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| but also that they still have the right to appeal to the body also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| I'll call back in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| They have the right to provide us more information on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| than is conventionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| I want to mention one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| We got a letter from the attorney from the Chamber of Commerce, Tom McFall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, this is a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Is the plan legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Just a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| You'll probably solve the letter, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| We are reviewing the letter and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| There aren't any parts of the plan that jump out as being void or extremely vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| So we're reviewing the plan and notify you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| So at this point, from the conversation I had with Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| his response to me, and I'm doing this as hearsay only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| so I've got to be careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| that he didn't say anything per se that was illegal about that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| but you guys would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| That is my sense as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| In the law department's defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| they did not get a copy of that until about 2.30 this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| And so you guys are going to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| and then issue an opinion for the members of the Counseling Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I'll defer to my law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Well, that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| I have a question along those same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| And we're still talking about slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Well, I'm wanting to maybe amplify the concern in that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| did you say that that's the answer to that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Because I'd like to address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| The answer about being illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| That they hadn't seen, from what I understand in terms of hearsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| that they hadn't seen anything that jumps out as illegal per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| but they're reviewing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| and I'm sure they're going to get back with you with their opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| Is that where you're standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| From what I can see, the memo raised three or four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| One was the argument that this is too vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| You can't tell if it reasonably applies to a particular piece of property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| Another was there hasn't been proper due process in enacting or adopting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| Currently, the plan hasn't been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| It's not binding on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| So there's more process to be gone through before the plan's operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| And there were a couple of other concerns that were similar to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| But just to reiterate, nothing jumps out as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| So we're not going to issue, you know, make a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| We're not going to defer that to legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| They can get back with you as quickly as possible on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Okay, so, you know, I tend to agree with his general comments as it relates to this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| being not a huge deal, but I guess I would like for if the law director issues a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| that that's somehow vetted through the state or someone like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| I'll let you guys manage that process from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| We're going to try to stay on task with this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| This is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Just as a matter of clarification of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| We need to make it quick, though, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Okay, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| We sent the letter to the city law director, the county law director, and the city council law director a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| We sent it to you guys when we saw on the agenda that you were going to discuss legalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| and McAdams was going to be out of town, so we sent it to you as an advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| but both law departments have had it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| That we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Okay, so you guys will look at that and get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Back to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| It's an important discussion, but I think that's going to have to be handled out of legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| and brought back to us rather than discussing it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Any other, right here, any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| I want to make sure they're there, vetted in terms of the slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3321)|
| 0:55:39| With this in mind, we need to talk about where we are with this, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| I mean, there's really about two or three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| They're obvious ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| One is, this is so much like what we've got that everybody in general feels like this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| And that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Or the other is, you know, this is so awful that we don't want to even chase the slope-density discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Or the third may be, what are areas that perhaps we could be more flexible on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| And I guess my question I want to ask right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| are there areas that you'd like to see more flexibility within this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| I'm not saying we're going to do it, I'm just saying I'm wondering if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| Are there areas you need, you felt like there ought to be more flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| or ought to be some kind of amendment or addressing to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| When you were talking with people yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| was there any concern over the fact there was no development on slopes over 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| And so you'd like, what would be your recommendation with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| I was just asking if that was a concern that was brought up in any of your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| if anyone had used that as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Within my meetings, that was not brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| There was a question definition of ridgetop, which we can talk about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| But that particular one wasn't brought up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| I think one of the concerns that's been brought up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and it's not from the development people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| it's more from the private citizens about the over 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| being it's their land and now they can't build anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| So that's the concern that they brought to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| Do you guys see any, is there any interest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| let's talk about that particular one, the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Is there interest in this room of allowing development over 50% in Hawaii?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| Certain circumstances, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| You're saying, say it to me real clear, because like I said, I don't listen real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Well, as Councilman Bailey pointed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| each piece of land is different, and that's why we need flexibility in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| But to tell somebody that they've got 50% land that they cannot ever put anything on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| to me, would be, you know, totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| But there are special instances where things could be done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| but it needs to be done with special criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| for that it protects not only them but the ones below them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| Mark, I'm going to come back to you in a second, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| So you're saying you understand that if somebody wants to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| under special circumstances with specific criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| there should be a way for them to build at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| that you would like to see that kind of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| But the reason my light is on is not to limit that strictly to the 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| but there are cases in a couple, you know, between 25 and 40, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| or maybe even 15 to 25 that, I mean, I know that's taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| with some of the move my units down and put them here, there, and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| but there are still certain circumstances where that, as Nick mentioned a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| if a plan comes in that it is, you know, a super-duper plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| and it takes all these things into consideration, then they should be allowed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| And so what I want to summarize and make sure I'm right on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| at this point now, Mark, I'm going to have you come back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| and I'm going to ask you a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| So he comes back and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| we want to make sure that if they want to build certain things at certain levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| there's a process with criteria that they can follow that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| Is that capable of doing that in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| or does that need to be amended to the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| The recommendation in the plan is to assign certain densities to rezoning cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| based on that formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| So if somebody has property that's 20% sloped over 50% on that 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| they would get zero credits towards their budget of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| That doesn't mean that they can't develop the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| That flexibility would come at the time of the development plan process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| where we would look at where those units ought to be sited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| those units that are allowed under the density calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| where they ought to be sited on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| and how do you go about minimizing the disturbance to the natural landforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| So the table probably could have been written more clearly to say that these are criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3622)|
| 1:00:32| or factors in calculating a density factor or a density credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| See, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| It's written rigidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| And if people understand that you're saying now is there is some flexibility in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| that takes away a lot of the heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| So what I hear you saying is you would like to see some clarity about that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So right now I come back and I hear only two things, basically, in flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| See some flexibility in terms of special circumstance, special criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| and some clarity about how that's described within language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| so people understand it doesn't seem so rigid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Those seem to be the areas of flexibility someone would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Mr. Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Yeah, just to expand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I mean, if you look at this as a private citizen, not as a developer, but as a private citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| 50% of your land, if we're looking at that, the slope at 50% or above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| and say it's 50% of your land, you've devalued that property by saying they cannot build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| A lot of loans on mortgages and stuff are based on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| And if that goes down, then they're going to have to readjust loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| or may or may not have to, but they're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| By saying that they can't develop, I would like to see that it doesn't say no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| that it says maybe case by case, or more specific than just special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3724)|
| 1:02:12| Because if not, we're going to have a lot of appeals being come across every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| So you're saying you would like to see, within the document itself, specificity about development at 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| That's what scares people now because it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| So anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| We're just looking at areas where people like to see some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| Anybody else want to add to this particular document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3754)|
| 1:02:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Are you ready to move on to the discussion of clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I want you to leave here having a more clear understanding of the slope and density issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| Everybody feel like they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Where we were, where we are, and what the key issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| and areas that you may need to find some ways whether you want to address those flexibility or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| We good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Either I'm doing really good or really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| I was just going to say these points that Commissioner Owen B. and Brown and Bailey made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| I understand these points, and I think in certain instances you have a developer that comes in and he's creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| Now we have GIS technology where you can read land better than you used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| And there might be some instances where, with a particular approach, this should be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| And I understand the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| And if they could find language that would put that in there but still keep the general plan, you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| And to reiterate, I think we have technology now that might actually be used as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| for developers who want to build in places that normally, just looking at the old way of looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| you say, well, you can't build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| But there's a possibility that now we have technology that says, you know, at first blush it looks like we couldn't build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| But we can use this now to where actually we know you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| You guys are coming to some pretty good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Coming to a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Anybody else understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| You're clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| We can move on to the degrading, clearing, and density discussion from here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Susan, can you help me for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Would you take these and put these on the wall over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3868)|
| 1:04:37| The world's largest Post-it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| No one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| When I do all day things, we just cover the whole place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| Come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| I know you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Pull that off and just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3893)|
| 1:05:24| If you'll turn to page one, I guess, or page four, it's in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| Now, let me get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3931)|

| 1:05:44| Now, you'll notice in the back, the planning commission did a more in-depth analysis of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| both slope and also clearing that they were able to get out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| They put that in your packet for additional information, but this is a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| This is how I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| Based on discussions with different people, I'm sure that others could help clarify it as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| Number one, current clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| The city and county engineering departments issued the permits for clearing and grading in the city and county, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| The city has a provision of saving six trees per acre, but the code goes on to allow complete clearing if topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| and other constraints pose difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| In that case, eight new trees require to be planted per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| All the city falls under this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| The county has neither conservation nor planning provisions except for preserving a buffer next to streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| The proposed clearing and grading plan, the hillside plan recommends a generalized clearing formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| which you can see at the bottom, which is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| The concept is the formula we'd use to make a recommendation in rezoning cases for the amount of clearing on hillside only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| If a party with an interest in developing the land believes the formula would be inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| the planning commission or appropriate legislative body could alter the clearing recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| When a recommendation is made to limit clearing, the MPC staff would have to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| during the site plan and concept plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| The site plan concept plan is required before subdividing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| The site plan would include areas of provisions for non-disturbance in similar proportion to that which is approved by the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| In the city, the planning commission could alter the non-disturbance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| could the city council and the county, the planning commission, the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| as well as the Board of Zoning Appeals could alter the non-disturbance area if the site plan is appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| With that, in terms of clearing, at zero, you can see it up there, zero to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| 100% clearing is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| 15 to 25%, 50% clearing is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| And here's where I need some clarification from two things I've read, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| I need you to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| This is what I pulled off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Is this accurate or is there a point where no clearing is allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| But you see the 100% at zero to 15, 15 to 25 at 50, 25 to 40, and this is off the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4087)|
| 1:08:16| 10% at 40 to 50, 50 plus, no development, and then ridge top, there would actually have to be a specific site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| Is that accurate or is there anything else you need to add to that to clarify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| It's accurate, and its intent, again, probably could have been written differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4108)|
| 1:08:37| in that the intent is for this to be used much the same way that we use the density factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| whereby with slope and density, we're applying those at the rezoning stage with clearing and grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| and these factors we would be applying at the development plan and concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| Second stage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Step two of zoning and step one of subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| Same plan, two different names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Development plan is associated with zoning, concept plan is associated with subdividing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| but they are literally the same plan in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| And we would prepare an overall budget, again, based on these factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| and apply it to the plan that's proposed and ultimately approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| There is, again, that same appeal process in the city to the city council, in the county to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| on development plan approval decisions by the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| but it doesn't necessarily say that on every chunk of a parcel that is over 40% or over 50% you can't clear trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4180)|
| 1:09:51| It simply says that when we prepare an overall budget, we're going to give no credit for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| or we're going to give credit for all of the trees that exist on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| And tell me, like I said, I learn slow, the reason for the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4201)|
| 1:10:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| The general policy is that the steeper the slope, the more we want to leave it undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| Primarily to minimize the amount of water runoff and erosion that can result from clearing steeply sloped lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4219)|
| 1:10:33| All the science points to starting those kinds of considerations at 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| and as the slopes increase, to minimize the amount of disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| That formula is calibrated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Is there someone here from the soil or science?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| I might have had, may have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| Could you step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Before you get there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| I'm sorry, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Mark was saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Step back, we'll let them finish this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I wasn't sure that I got it because it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| He was saying that the 15%, I mean, I think the 50%, who's going to quarrel with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| But the 15% and the 10% clearing limitations, were you saying those are not absolutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| but they go to whether or not you get a credit for bonuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Because there's a real difference about how much you clear, and we hear lots of complaints about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| I might have to clear a wider road than 20 feet to build it, I mean, in order to get my equipment in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| So what is the clearing percentage limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| What does it mean again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| It's used the same way that we use the density factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| in that the numbers are used to prepare an overall budget for clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| So you could end up with a parcel that says that you can clear 73% of that total parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| So we would then look to find the places where we can save 27% of that parcel in an undisturbed case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4324)|
| 1:12:14| and we would look first to the most deeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| But you could have a case where next to a stream where we have a requirement that if you have trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| you need to save them for 75 feet, but we're going to give you credit for taking 100% of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4344)|
| 1:12:32| if it's below 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| What if I've got this 10 acres and it's in this 25% to 40% range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Am I limited to a total amount of area clearing of 15% in terms of literally the percentage of the landmass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| or is that only for calculating whether I get a zero bonus or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| In other words, how restrictive is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| He's wanting to know how restrictive that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| If, for example, your parcel was entirely within one range and it was 15% to 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| you would be allowed to clear 50% of the total parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| Right, and I'm saying that one's not very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| When you get down to 15% or 10%…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| The 25% and up is what I think he's…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Yeah, and the data indicates that there is…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| I think it's like 8,000 acres of the 130 are sloped 50% or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| so it's a relatively small proportion of the total area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| Don't go to the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It's the middle range there that has the most land in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| We're looking at the 25% to 40% has 25% of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| and 40% to 50% has 7.25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| You're talking about 32% of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Are you limited to that percentage, or is that only for calculating a zero bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| because you did, I don't know, you cleared 18% and not 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| There are no recommendations for bonuses based on clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| It's an absolute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| You cannot clear as a percentage of the land, 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| That's the recommended budget going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| Certainly, through the development plan approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| we all acknowledge that, okay, the formula says 68%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| but you're coming in at 70% and you've done the best job that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| Help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| This is how I describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| I want to make sure that I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| and then maybe the councilman can help him a little bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| You're saying those aren't credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Those aren't credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| That's fairly absolute coming in on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| You may repeal it, and there may be other plans you can make changes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| but if you're developing land and all the land is between 25% and 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| then you can clear 15% of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| That's the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Now, there can be appeals and there can be special circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| but that's not written as a highly flexible model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| You just need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| If your parcel is entirely between 25% and 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| you're going to have half a unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| so you're going to have two-acre minimum lots, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| and with 8,000 to 10,000 square feet in a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| you can find a buildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Coming back to that, councilman, did you get your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Yeah, but I'm picturing if I have a subdivision or I'm developing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| I've got a road, I've got a parcel where I've got to put the house footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| The fire codes want me to clear a little bit outside of the reaches of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| so you can get around it and put out a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| I'm just trying to figure out whether it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| So you're trying to figure out if that's a reasonable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Yeah, is it too small is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| So what I hear you saying, I want to make sure I understand you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| is you're concerned about is 15% a reasonable amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| and you were asking how much flexibility was tied into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Is that what I heard you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| We were given an example at one of the workshops where MPC appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| where they showed a piece of land that had a combination turf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| flat land and a hillside, and of course the goal was to direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| more of the development and denser development down low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| But if you have essentially a steep piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| is the absolute limit 15% when you're in the 25 to 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| So when we come back to concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| that needs to be something we make sure we put up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| All right, one question real quick, come back here to the science guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| In terms of stormwater runoff, what do we need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| and we're talking about clearing and density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| what are one or two things or some specific things we need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| about stormwater runoff that will affect this, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| Well, in terms of stormwater runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| you're regulated already by virtue of EPA through the MPDS permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| that Knox County and the city of Knoxville has to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| You know, that's pertaining to one inch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| and there are regulations already that you have to control the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| You have to control the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| The best way that I could think to illustrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| what happens in the natural versus developed scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| is to give you the diagram that all of y'all have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| that shows the difference in the amount of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Yes, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| How you change the amount of evapotranspiration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| and infiltration, and runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| whenever you go from a natural setting to a disturbed setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| And a lot of that is due to soil compaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Water doesn't infiltrate compacted soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| So it changes it drastically, and obviously with a steeper slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| your erosion potential is much greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| and your ability to be able to retain that first inch is much harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| What David was suggesting is exactly what I was looking at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| And also, when you remove much of the vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| and you remove much of the root system that is holding that soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| your energy level of the water goes up greatly as the slope increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| So removing more vegetation at higher slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| will increase erosion and also increase runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| When you're looking at runoff potential once land is cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| and denuded of vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| it goes up about five-fold for what it would be in a natural state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| in trees and other vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| because rainfall energy is impacted greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| by hitting the canopy of whatever plants are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| slowing it down, and making it much less erosive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| and much less viable for runoff as it is falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I'm sorry. Go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| And so what I hear you say basically is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| the things that we need to be aware of here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| number one, there is an EPA standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| And was I correct when I said one inch of the first...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Could you kind of clarify that standard real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| The one-inch rule is a fairly new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| It was issued in Phase 2 of the NPDES regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| So that originates with EPA, who passes it to TDEC in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| and then TDEC sends it to the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| And regardless of this plan, all that's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| Knox County and City of Knoxville have to enforce stormwater ordinances right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| And there's no choice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| But how a developer handles the land greatly impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| whether or not they can be in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Hey, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| If we could ask any of the speakers to just give their name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| That's fabulous. All right. Could you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| And any affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| David Vandergriff, UT Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| I'm a certified arborist and certified professional horticulturist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| Neil Denton, UT Extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| director here in Knox County of the UT Extension office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I'm an agronomist and horticulturalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Any questions of these guys before I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Of course, they'll still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| I was wondering if David or Neil would apply some of what they just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| to the specific questions that Nick had about the 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| And by that, I mean when I think from conversations that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| on the task force with developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| they're very adverse to going in to places like 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| They're very vocal that those are not desirable places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| for reasons that you all just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| You just can't do it with economy and any carefulness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| But I was just wondering if you all had any comments relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| to what Nick was concerned with about a site that was primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| if not all, within a 25 to 40% range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| Because just looking at a number like 15% clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| that does seem harsh maybe from a developer standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| But is it reasonable to you all from a soil...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| And keep that from a soil perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| As a soil scientist perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| is there anything you can add to that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| That's what we want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| I think the big thing to keep in mind is look at the amount of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| If it's restricted to 15% on the 25 to 40% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| but you're talking about two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| 15% of two acres is a good amount of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| I think it would be unreasonable to say that a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| wouldn't have room to develop with that amount of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| they could disturb on that large a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| What I want you to focus on is from a soil science perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| is the question he's asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| is the 15% kind of in that reasonable range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| or can you not really say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I mean, what you know is the runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| but there's not really a formula that says within a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| you can develop this much to manage storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Is there anything...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I guess that's what I'm looking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I'm looking for simplicity, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Is there anything that just says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| oh yeah, there's this formula and this is how you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| There is formulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| But the problem is, in this discussion, I see it's case by case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| because it deals with slope length, with soil type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| with all of those different things that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| and also what the previous use of the land was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| and also how much of the soil has already been eroded in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| by agriculture and other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| because most of the land that we're talking about in the 25 to 40% range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| was once farmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| So a lot of the soil has already been lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| and that comes into the equation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| But 15% is a reasonable amount to allow on two acres, two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| You're going to look at something where you've got three-tenths of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| to use for the footprint for the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| or in the placing of landscape, lawn, and a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| So that is going to be a reasonable amount in most situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| However, our slopes here are so small in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Slopes change drastically over small reaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| In tens and hundreds of feet, we're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| where in other places we'd be talking thousands of feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| And that can come into play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| But overall, 15% seems pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| So from a soil science perspective, that seems reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| We may call on you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Councilman Della Volpe is coming from a development perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| that that seems restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| So we have those two concepts that are floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Let me add a thought, and that is that they were talking about EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| and Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| The Tennessee general construction permit was adopted on May 23, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5092)|
| 1:25:01| after this plan was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| And it is in effect for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Some things haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| When you come in to develop anything more than one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| you must file a stormwater pollution prevention plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| that says how you're going to deal with erosion and sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| and siltation and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| And it has to be prepared by an engineer, a licensed engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| or a landscape architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| or someone who's taken the design courses provided by TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| to enable them to be able to show that they are dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| Now, it's true, the more you clear, the more erosion, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| the less trees absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Tree roots hold the world together, and you take them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| you have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| And the same is true with other vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| But there are buffers in there for if you're near an undamaged stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| you've got to be 60 feet back, no equipment, nothing happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| You've got to stay away from the stream bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| So there are rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| There are inspection requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| And I guess the question is, this rule seems absolute again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| And Mark was addressing, well, later you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| when you come in with engineering, if you get that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| perhaps you can show a design that's really intelligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| and avoids not using that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| But I think the 15% clearing is absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| I wonder when you add roads in addition to the footprint for the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| and the clearing for fire protection, whether that's a good number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| or a bad number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Our neighboring city, Sevierville, uses 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| I don't know whether that's a good number or a bad number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| I'm just saying that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| You're asking a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Yeah, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Yes, and so what I hear in summary, real quick on this one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| in terms of rainwater, obviously we know that the more undeveloped land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| the less runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| And the question you had is, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| And, by the way, we're held to that already within the current rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| We have ways of dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| It doesn't prevent runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| The rules make you deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Deal with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Here they're saying this is one way to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| And you're asking the question, is that reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Mother Nature's way of managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Less clearing is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| The question is, is it too restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Is it too restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| That's the question we're asking, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| We can clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Can we move to the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| When you talk about the percentage of land that can be cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| how do you take into account land that's already cleared in your development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| Question, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| Can you ask that one real quick, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| If land, if you're, I hear you saying it, if I get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| If I'm not clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| And 20 acres are already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Does that, how does that affect the clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Is that counted into the clearing already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| The plan makes a recommendation as far as these clearing factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| If that recommendation is then run within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| and an ordinance is created to codify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| we would have to have some provisions in there for dealing with existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| But if it's already cleared and your budget exceeds that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| then we're going to try to direct your development into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| to utilize that cleared space first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| and then eat into the uncleared space as the budget allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| So you're saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| I mean, right now, the way it stands, the cleared space needs to be counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| You say that maybe there may be some kind of ordinance later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| that may deal with previously cleared land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| But at this point, it is considered part of the clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| If the already cleared space exceeds your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| then we would use the limits of the existing cleared space on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| Do you hear what he's saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| He says yes, in essence, until it's dealt differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| See, that's the great thing about not being that bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I can say stuff really short, you know, and no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| I mean, we had kind of the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| To me, every piece of property is different as it stands today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| and it just gets very fuzzy when you get into what's already been cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| and what part of the property it's already cleared on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| versus where you would like to develop or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| And so every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Then we're going to move to the support and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| We're doing the concerns right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| so I want to do it in a kind of more orderly manner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| So I definitely understand what Councilman Bailey was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| but I guess I'd like an answer maybe from the soil guys or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| I hadn't seen anyone necessarily argue that Mother Nature's way is that these numbers are accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5391)|
| 1:30:00| and the statement was made, I guess we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Is Mother Nature's way too restrictive, I think, is what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| I said leaving land in the natural form is Mother Nature's way of dealing with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| It's absorbed by the tree roots and grass roots and bushes and shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| It's slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| It's decelerated, and so it causes less erosion, less siltation, less problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| But, again, you deal with that by engineering as well when you clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| That's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| I guess my question, I think what I heard was that these numbers, this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| embraces Mother Nature's way in a way that we can do as much development as folks deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| I guess my comment is, and maybe Nick started to answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| I've not seen an engineered way of necessarily dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| I know detentive plans and whatnot, but I'm not for its development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| So I'd like to see something on your paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| So what I hear you guys saying, and this is just trying to figure this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| is basically both of you agree that Mother Nature's way is a really efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| positive way to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| You would say, what I heard you say, Councilman, was that when you develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| you have to engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| You have to engineer around the runoff you create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| And they're coming back saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Or requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Or requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| You should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| And they're saying what this does, they're developing a plan that will use more of Mother Nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| to manage that and less of the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Is that kind of what I understand you guys saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| In the simplest, remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| We've got to put it in Steve words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| You really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| You have to dumb it down or we don't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| For example, if you clear a space and you make a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| and you use pervious bricks that allow water to penetrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| you have sort of used Mother Nature's way in part, but you have cleared that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| You've restored part of it by trying to use the water back into the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| So kind of moving to the next step, what is it you find supportive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| What do you like about the clearing density discussion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| What is it you can get behind you feel like is a good thing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| I think it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| I hadn't heard anyone say anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| So when you mean it works, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| Would you be real specific about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| It meets the law, as the gentleman pointed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| It also allows for, you know, we can argue the point how much, how little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| It allows for development while meeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| and understanding the nature of these slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| So it provides for kind of Mother Nature within the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| and it allows for at least some development is what I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Anybody else, kind of what do you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5583)|
| 1:33:12| Anybody want to add anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| I'll make sure I don't leave anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| I'll just second what Sam said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| I think it does allow for development while still providing some necessary protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| And I think also like what Nick was saying about the pervious materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| that's an area that's developing really fast with new stuff coming out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| And I think that those sorts of materials are only going to improve from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| So I'm actually, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing what's going to be available next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| in five years and ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| I think that this will only improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| So you're supporting those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Anybody, Commissioner Norton, want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| This may be a bit of an expansion of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| I don't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| It's not that I'm ignoring you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| I just didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| By virtue of what David and Neil just presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| it's consistent with what science tells us about how soils work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| and how problematic erosion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| and what we need to do as best we can in development practices to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Anyone else want to add something else to this support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Yes, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Yes, quite simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| It's protective of property rights and property values down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| You know what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| That's a spell check because I misspelled a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| It's the old manual spell check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Right there, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| You know, they said never do math and spell in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| So it's protective of property rights downstream, downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5701)|
| 1:35:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| What about concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Now, here's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| I want to make sure I get this correct from Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| He's not sitting there saying 15% is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I just don't know if that's too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| I have concerns about that and the absoluteness of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| I'm saying that and I'm saying that our neighbor to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| what would that be, southeast, which is Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| has said that, you know, let's use 30% clearing as the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| Let's require that there be a certain amount of tree cover that if you take it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| you replace the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| And you went in your little listing, you went where Knoxville, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| has some replacement requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| The county doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| But the idea that you reforest as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| And so if it's too restrictive, we ought to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| And I suppose in addition to asking plant scientists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| we should ask hydrologists that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Probably some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Anybody have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| This is concerns section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Councilman Thomas, you have a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Under what we said was supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| we've said it allows a lot of environmental protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| but it does allow economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| But the concern is can that economic development be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Can the development be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| I'm just, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| See, you guys, see the handwriting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| Don't you wish Phyllis was here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| You could read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| You know, she's putting her kid in college in Oregon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| so you got my handwriting instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Anybody else have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| What are other concerns you have about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| It's just what I said earlier, that I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| it gets fuzzy when you, every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| Some have already been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Others haven't at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| Where the development would fit versus where the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| or the developer would want to go versus where it's already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| Anyone else want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Basically, does everybody kind of understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| Do you have a good idea of what you're looking at up there in terms of clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| And then come back and understand the supportive sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| As you know, it uses Mother Nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| It really does manage erosion and water in a way that's intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| It does a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| There are those who believe that allows for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| consistence with that kind of protection against erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| It gives them, and some would say plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| They feel like others would say it also protects the downhill people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| I mean, that people are catching the brunt of that runoff and slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| and water and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| It protects them, and it does all that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| On the other side, you know, concerns are coming back to the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| You know, how absolute should this number be, and is that too tight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| Do we need to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| I think Sevier County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| I think Sevier County's got a 30% type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| You know, and can it be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| We claim that, but we really don't know if it can be done economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| And the concern that, you know, can you do this kind of strict numbering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| when properties differ, and how do we manage that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Any other questions or comments you want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| before we kind of move on to other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I just wanted to add to the supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| the same thing that we did in the previous discussion about density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| and that is that these are proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| There's still an element of flexibility within these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| There is the judgment of the staffers and the experts in this field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| that are going to make decisions about where and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| And so I consider it still that an aspect of the supportive side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| is that it does have flexibility to look at these special landforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| which we, you know, we acknowledge that in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| It's very, we have a varied topography, and the staff knows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5956)|
| 1:39:23| and I think they've built that into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| So what I understand you saying, what I understand the process says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| you can come in and you can have these, but you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| if someone comes in, the MPC can look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| they can make adjustments based upon proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| If they're unhappy with that, they can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| and they can appeal to their elected officials about clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| as well as they can on slope, and you guys can change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| or do whatever you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| But that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| So with that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=5995)|
| 1:40:08| let's talk about kind of the areas where there might be some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| Where are some areas that we could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| and maybe make some adjustment to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| that might make it more useful in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| Can we go back to, I'll just go back to the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Do you think that needs to be an area, the 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| where we might need to look at changing that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Is that what you think an area of flexibility would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| The 15% development at the 25, 40% level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| Again, I don't have the answers because I don't have the technical training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| and probably very few of us have the level of technical training in this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| or collection of bodies to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| But I have heard the argument made that if you list a long list of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| that sort of end results you must reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| but leave the flexibility to the designer to try to achieve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| you harness that kind of ingenuity and whatnot that we kind of treasure as Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| And when you make the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| come convince me in a planned zone that what you want to do is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| you take away from me the ability as a businessman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| to prepare a business plan on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| In other words, I've got to take a lot of risks if I'm a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| and I don't mean to stand here and talk only about developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| because I represent lots of people who are downhill and downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| and they're affected by floodwaters and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| But if you're a developer and you're making a business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| you want to look at this and say, okay, there's so many acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Bubba's going to sell it for X dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| I'm going to have to spend this kind of money on engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| on building it out, on loans and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| And to the extent the criteria are in front of me, I can do my own math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| I might be wrong. I might go belly up, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| But I can do my own math and figure out is this something I want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| If you force me in the alternative to buy it, plan it, engineer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| and then go see if I can make it work, I don't know if I want to take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| So you might be discouraging development because you discourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| the kind of business assessment that someone would want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| And that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Yeah, that really fits under concerns, but I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Okay, so that's more of a concern, but it's a very articulate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| And so that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| You kind of need to put that one on that concern list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| And we're looking for what are some areas of flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| Are there areas where there could be some flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| Areas that you'd like to see maybe some give and take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| Or is this plan exactly what you want, or it's so bad you can't deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| It's not stated explicitly in the plan about some of the avenues of flexibility that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6191)|
| 1:43:21| We've talked about this again and again, the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| It's a plan and some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| And I don't know if that needs to be written explicitly in there saying if you do not like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| or if you feel you have this or there are exceptions, this may be appealed, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| And I think that that may leave some of the real heartburn and concerns that we're seeing from the different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6219)|
| 1:43:52| you know, both the landowners over property rights and the developers over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| because so much of what we heard is that the law doesn't allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| It's not going to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| It's not going to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| And I think that was a lot of the misunderstanding that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| Some of it was true misunderstanding and some of it was intentional misinformation to, you know, to blur things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6246)|
| 1:44:15| But I think if we put something into the plan, it's to make it explicit, make it in black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| and make it understandable about what the appeals process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| And so I hear what I hear Commissioner Briggs is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| You know, we need to pretty clearly state how that process works if you want flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| And there's an appeals process, the way you can go to do things differently or change the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| and you may have a good idea of why you should develop more than 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| and there's a process you can go through to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| I hear over here on the concern side from the councilman is he has a concern that that type of percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| will keep people from being creative, but, you know, he doesn't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| A little further down the risk chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| A little further down the risk chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Before you make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| In other words, you may have committed resources and dollars at that point rather than paper and ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Does anybody have anything else that you – is this about flexibility or areas you see some flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Everybody else, I know it's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| You're dropping like flies, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| I'm just losing people on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| So are we – is there anything else you want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| A little tag on what Nick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| A little tag on what Nick said, which I thought was very, very well articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| I guess maybe the end of that, though, is, again, because of my circumstances in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| obviously I'm concerned about the people downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| And what if you have a developer who's trying to do all this and he thinks he's got a good plan, but he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| And the people downtown suffer from his mistake no matter how well-intentioned he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| or, you know, what resources he's brought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| So I guess that's kind of – I understand completely Councilman Della Volpe's point, and it's a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| I guess that, I guess, is kind of the concern that kind of evolves out of his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| And so what I hear you saying is as we talk about flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| there has to be this balance between creativity and good management that you don't end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| And there's got to be that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| A couple more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| We'll kind of tie things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| I'll go to Commissioner Norm and Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| The same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| It's just extending upon what Charlie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| It's, you know, what the specialists in the field know is that we have to consider not just a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6402)|
| 1:46:54| And stormwater managers have a much broader view of this topic of erosion and water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| And so it's a watershed approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| And I sympathize with a businessman that has a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| and he's trying to maximize his profit on that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| but he has that parcel that lives and breathes within a watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| And so as we try to accommodate the property rights of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6438)|
| 1:47:26| we've got to respond to the reality of what's going on in this much larger area in terms of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6446)|
| 1:47:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| That's almost what I said when we had our deliberations over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| One of the points that I made is that sometimes the biggest problems deals with codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| enforcement, and having penalties that are stiff enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| when someone just ignores the law to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| And if you look up here to the people that are opposed to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| what they were saying here, they said just leave the current policies in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| but enforce the requirements and policies rather than develop new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| And so I think even the people that are opposed to the plan recognizes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| that's maybe what we need to do as much as anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| I feel like we've had a good discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| I hope you guys have seen some movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| What I hope to accomplish tonight was, first of all, clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Remember what I stated our goal was tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| Number one, to understand each other's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Number two, have clarity about slope, clearing, and density, how that works, how that's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| what the concerns are, what supports are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110818hillsideprotection?start=6514)|
